lol i know! haha WHY WERE YOU UP SO EARLY?! 
Hahahaha yes! I saw her last night =) I told her to tell you that I say hi =). I had a geat time! Thanks =) I had some memorable experiences....but I'm gla to be back home. I don't think I'm fluent...but I can talk well! 
well good =) I certainly hope so! I don't think I'll be able to speak english in spanish class ever again, though. I think I'll annoy the other students =/ haha eeehhhhh? Cadavers? sounds a bit creepy haha. 
Haha yeah it was TOTAL immersion. Kind of---there were some english speaking people on the same campus as us. It as really fun, but a weird part was learning how to think exclusively in spanish. Haha I don't think he'll mind but I had a dream last night that I was talking to some native speaker and he was looking at me REALLY weird...like he didn't understand me ver well =/  haha. Well that's good that they were legal...but I would be a little freaked out by dead people. The fundamentals of polka? 
Hey sorry it took me a a while to respond--I've been in band camp all week! haha yeah I asked him once if he thought in spanish or english and he told me that he thought in both but didn't really notice when he switched and that it just depended on what he was reading/speaking. I was kind of confused/I didn't understand....how it worked, but now I do!  Haha Yeah i've wondered what we sound like, too, and they call us GRINGOS. haha  Yecck they still sound really disturbing. Huh...well polka sounds quite interesting haha.  Yeah I know I'm going tomorrow from like noon to three because we have a marching band break so that we can go. I don't know about Saturday yet. 
Hey! Thank you SOOOO much! I will be working on that probably while you're at church/early this afternoon. Thank you for being so understanding, Leandra!  It did go well, thanks =). Were you planning on filling out all the slides that you put titles on? Or did you just come up with those slide headers? I found information for a lot of those headers. 
Awesome! I am working on it right now. I found a lot of info on trapper boys. So i'll defiitely do that one, if that's okay. And I found a lot of pics. =)
Okay. When are you going to be working on it? Do we want to just add to it throughout the day when we can? I'm going to try to work on it a lot right now.  Thanks!
I know!!! Some of them look like they are really old me though. . * men
Okay that sounds great. Let do it then! http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/history/news-photographs-boys-working-mines-early-1900s?image=0. this one looks kind of old
It might take me a couple of minutes. is that okay? I've been reading all of the info first. 
okay great!
I added to one slide and did two or three. yeah definitely. sorry i was trying to get that to load. 
just a little bit, but not too long. 
No it's not a problem! What are you adding to/doing? did you see what I added? 
Sounds fantastic.. I added in hurriers and a source and some info. how many slides do we need total? 
Okay thanks! . And i just found information about mule drivers and put that in there. 
Great! I am about to look for info on switch boys. I'll let you know if I find anything
That sounds good. . I found a government website that has history on coal mining. . I am looking at it right now. 
I think that that is right at the right time, don't you? 
Oh yeah I think you're right. . Didn't they also mention progressives in part of it? 
And a bit more.
Sounds good. I fixed the sources. So i'll add that to yours. . To be honest I don't remember where I found the $.60 wage. I think i found it on the government website but I'm not sure. . we can take that out since I don't remember the year. . we might want to add something about the photographer who took most of the pictures in our powerpoint. For the handout, should we make it almost verbatim of the slides? Are we making slot notes? 
Okay. Do you want to do the photographer or do you want me to? Is it okay that I just started doing slot notes? We can do half and half if you want. I've only done 2 slides so far. 
Awesome! Thanks! yeah they are easy. I can just do the rest of them if you want =)
Okay that sounds good! I am only on expectations right now. . Alright I finished all of the slot notes except for the photographer. 
Awesome! I'll do that then. Do you want to just upload it when you're finished putting pictures up? . Okay here are the slot notes
 That sounds great! Thanks a bunch. oh are we supposed to present in 5-10 minutes???
O.O Now what? should we just give them the slides in the handout form? 
me too! I didn't know that it was supposed to be such a short presentation
if you want to do that then you can. It's too bad that it has to be so short though!
yeah i agree. i feel like what's on the slides is what we know, though. so we wouldn't be putting in very much oral stuff. 
We could do that but I don't think it's worth the trouble. i don't think that we're being graded on how we present, but what we present. probably.  Awesome! It looks great!
Yeah! It looks so cool!! =D
yay!!!! =D. alright I have to go. Thanks a bunch I am so happy that we finished!
did you find out?  
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so happy for you!!!!!!! Congrats Congrats congrats!  I am applying there...Maybe we'll both go?? =) Ahh!!! Way to go!!!! =D
Hey!!   Thanks! Things are great. I had a good first semester :).  I hope that everything is going well for you too! How are you liking UVA?   Haha of course Lawrence would say something like that...
yes!! I would love to catch up!! Sorry I am terrible at responding...I don't get back to people as quickly as I should :/. I hope your semester is going well so far! :)
Hi Leandra! I meant to message you a couple of days ago when it was actually your birthday...sorry I didn't get the chance so Happy Belated Birthday! I hope everything is going well with you and that you have a great fall semester :)
That's the dog I'm sitting / training. He's still a puppy and not well trained, but getting a loooot better. It's hard work but I like it a lot!
Haha basically everything! Because of how cute and fluffy he is, his owners don't really discipline him or anything. So the first day I walked him, he was pulling so hard that his harness unfastened and he ran away. I was so scared but I realized if he were well trained / behaved he would have run away or been pulling at all. So that's what I started with - walks. Then sit and come, now lay down. He also doesn't jump on you as much and he used to bite and nip a lot but that has gotten much better.
Hi Leandra! Thanks for asking me :D  I was thinking about going but I don't have a car and wasn't sure about taking the bus because I don't know the schedule on the weekend (and it's different because of steppin out). So, I would probably need a ride if we meet either today or tomorrow.
Yep! No worries though if you can't :)
Yeah that sounds perfect! My address is 205 Primrose Drive (where I'm living this summer)Thanks Leandra! Happy thanksgiving to you too! :)Hey!. Do you have a class now?. When can we meet?
No prob!. Shall we meet at rice 032 in few minutes?Ok sure I'll see you thereHey! You're fine! Yeah that's fine with me if raven leaves stuff there! Her dresser is cute! Do you know how much she wants to sell it for? Also, I have an exam tomorrow and Tuesday so I'll probably be cramming but I'll be over at the house Wednesday morning before I go home for break...would you be free around then? We could grab coffee at Nau?
Ok cool! I'll think about the desk and I'll come find you after I'm done meeting with Dani and Liz!
Would like 10:30/11 be ok with you?
Ok awesome! Looking forward to it :). Hey! I'll be there in 5 or 10 minutes! Could I possibly glance at the room?
Hey! I hope your summer is going well! Quick question for you... Do we know utilities for this month yet?
Ok sounds great! No worries about the coffee maker! Looking forward to seeing you! All is good here....
Hey! Ive got to go get a parking pass soon so if I'm not here when you arrive, the new bottom door key is in our lockbox!Hi! Sorry!! I've been so busy this week!

Thanksss so much Leandra!
Yes i sent it last week to the address u sent in the message!! It would be great if you could check again! But ill ask my dad if he put a tracker on it
What was your address again? Was it in nova?
I just checked the tracker and it says "Notice Left (No Authorized Recipient Available)" they probably came when you weren't there so they will definitely have it at the post office!! It would be great if you could get that tomorrow so we can make sure we didn't lose checks!. Please! We're just kinda freaked out
Yeah my dad likes to make sure it gets to people!! Thanks Leandra!!. Did they not leave a notice on the door?
Ohhh ok thanks so much!!!. Thanks for bringing this to my attention also!! I usually make sure with Liz when i mail checks but i forgot this time! And the same thing happened with the utilities i just sent her haha

My friend is getting on my case about planning Japan... For twenty days - wondering how to get trains and lodging, also the optimal path thru cities. Thanks a bunch!!!
You bought tickets in the town?  And lodging is just by emailing the people?  Optimal path through all the Japan!
thank you for the tips!!!. that sounds like a fun trip!<3. u r the bomb dot com on CD-ROMOk awesome, I got your utilities payment as well!. Hey Leandra! Just wanted you to know that a box was delivered here for you. Do you want to pick it up or have me mail it to you?

Oh yeah! Sorry! I'm visiting my sister
Hey Leandra! I'll be gone tonight as well

Hey! I'll be out late too. And I feel a lot better thanks! I was just dealing with a migraine, head cold and severe lack of sleep haha so I just needed to recharge. Sorry for taking over the room today
Hey Leandra! Did you leave to go home today?
Oh ok sorry I was a tad too disoriented when we talked about it earlier haha just wanted to ask so I knew wether or not to be concerned if you didn't come home tonight. Have a great break!
Hey are you coming back tonight?
Hey Leandra are you coming home tonight?Well you're usually asleep by the time I get home lol so I guessHi!!!!. I'm going to be your Intern buddy this summer!! I'm gonna send you a more formal email but just wanted to let you know haha
To answer your wardrobe question, i would be a little more dressy the first day just because my first day for the internship and full time, I was introduced to so many upper level people. You want to make that good impression. But I would dress in layers because the temperature gets really weird with the ac but then the heat from the computers lol. And then after the first day you'll see how your team dresses and then you can match that leek. *level. I dress a little nicer just cuz I have all these nice/cute clothes that I want to wear lol
Of course! Ask me anything lol. The panera just came if you want some . We just got the panera . If you want to come get some 
Ya I'll be there in a few. Going to get Anna
I'm here where are you . Did u have to buy 
Hmm I'm by the cash registers
I don't see you
Hey!. No worries. Do you want to do 10:30?
Lol ignore my calendar haha. Kk I'll move it!. I'll come get you from 6th floor then :)

Of course! Sorry about that
Hey I'll be down in 5 min sorry!

Oh I thought we could do today instead of Friday cuz of the long weekend
But if you're busy we can catch up anther time!
Kk I'll meet you in 5!
Hi! So the shuttle doesn't come at specific times. You can download the work app and that tells you where the shuttle is. I'll probably check the time around 11:15 and then I can message you and we can all meet in the lobby. And take the shuttle together :). Do you know who else in hq is going to the lunch?
Umm try cof@work. It's like blue and yellow
Yayy. I think the password is disrupt
Solid and then you just have to fill in your location and the shuttle is under transport
Yes awesome so we will try to take the one around 11:30/11:40
Ok perfect!! I'll message Claire when I get in. Idk who mark is thigh. Though
Omg thank you so much. Wait did I miss the shuttle?
I'm already in the lobby lol. We didn't miss it. Yup!. I'm sitting in the chairs closest to the pickup
Hi!. Yes of course :). Do you want to do 9?
Or I can do the end of the day if that works?
Let's do now then!
Perfect. During your lunch and learn you should ask about docker lol
I heard you were the only one who looked interested lol. How was it?
Yay that's good!. I work with him all the time lol. So that's why I told you to ask him about docker
Hahaha you should!!!. You can tell him you're my friend. And then you should have no impediments with getting help from him haha
Hi Collin and I will be down in a few minutes!!
Yes that's perfect!!. I was going to have to move our meeting today so I was going to message you lol
That's perfect!
Sounds good. Hi! Are you free this afternoon? I have to do something by 10:30 this morning so I was wondering if we could meet after that?
Let's do 2-2:30?

Ahhh Kk I'll be down in 5!. 10:30 still good?. I'm just chilling on one of the couches down here!
Oh no worries!

It's in towers
Oo ok maybe I'll try to see if we can talk a little on Monday then!. I'm not sure how intense the training will be cuz it's with my new team
I really hope it is lol
no worries about today!. let me check my calendar and i'll let you know haha, i dont even know right now =P. Hey! So I'll be in towers on the ninth floor today so do you want to meet in the morning?
What time do you get to work?. The awkward thing is that there's no start time on the meeting invite for my training haha. So want to meet once we both get to work? Like 8:30/8:45ish
Kk perfect! I should be in around that time too!. What floor are you on in towers today?
Ok perfect!. I'll message you once I'm at towers :)
Me too!. Let me know when you're here! I'm just trying to find my training room right now haha
Kk my training starts at 9 so we could meet for like 15 min?
Ya that works! I'm sitting in one of the booths right now
Happ birthday!!! I hope you had a great day :) also congrats on your offer!!

Ahhh Good luck
I will be soon at lunch right now. Let's meet up after your interview!
Hi! Stop by rice 120 for food and other things to help you study!

Here's the event page. https://www.facebook.com/events/1832833816976459/?ti=icl
Yay!! Also invite your friends!. Anyone you think that would be interested :)

thank you!!I am! hows school?Thanks Leandra, I actually couldn't get my shift covered at work so I'm at work now, but I'm going to be racing next weekend :)I wish it was cars! And that's so awesome, I really want to go snorkeling again. I'm going to Puerto Rico over spring break279E5EADFBD2ADC5
no problem!. hey! when do you get back from japan/when will you be in cville? I will be  gone after the 9th for my internship in seattle and I wanted to give you rent checks before I head out

ok great! I'll make sure there are 2 there for you before the 5th!. Did you find them?Awesome! If you could give me a heads up a couple of days before you cash them so I can make sure there's enough money in my account that would be greathttps://hangouts.google.com/call/q6kprp5r7tmoqwxemxmuvnchtua
I'm thinking about taking a class with Professor Weimer next semester. I'm guessing you would recommend him?
Sounds like you really enjoyed his class, thanks for the info!
Sure Leandra, would you be free in the afternoon or evening?
Yeah, I'll see you in Rice Hall then!
Thanks Leandra! I'll keep you posted about my progress
Sounds good
What are my options? I'm aiming to make about 5 slides for my part.
I don't have a preference (and I've only skimmed part of the paper at this point tbh), so I would be fine presenting Task Definition and Question Answering
Same here!. I'll be there in a few minutes
Hi Leandra, I should be free until 5. When would you like to meet?
Okay, I'll get started shortly
Awesome, good luck at the hackathon!
I pushed the pickled classifiers and vocabulary lists. I also added a feature_vector method to fb_classifier.ipynb that converts a text message into the feature vector. Remember that vocab1 is for driver and roundtrip classification, and vocab2 is for spam classification
No problem! Is there anything else you need?
That's a good idea, my original jupyter notebook file is a mess. I'll  get started, it shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.
I uploaded predict_new.py. It has an unpickle method that returns all of the unpickled classifiers and vocabularies, and a predict method that returns the desired predictions. For the predict method, it takes all of the unpickled objects as input so that the code does not have to unpickle every time the method is run. I haven't had time to test it, but let me know if you have any questions!
Okay, I reuploaded the files, can you try again?
No problem, I'm glad it worked!
Thanks, we'll keep in touch over the next week and I'll see you after the break!
Sounds good!. I'll be there in 10 minutes
Okay, I'll be there soon
thanks, it looks a lot like sharelatex
True, that's a clear benefit
Maybe I could write about preprocessing and machine learning, and you talk about your stuff. Idk what that distribution is, what do you think?
Sure, I agree with that. One small thing, I'll be leaving on the 11th, so we should try to finish before that if possible
True. Working remotely should be fine actually. I remember when we turned in the text mining paper with literally minutes remaining, but it looks like we'll be done ahead of time.
Great, I'll finish my share some time in the next week!
Hey Leandra, I finished everything I was supposed to do except for Related Works. Would you mind helping me with this part?
I added a paragraph  briefly talking about Deep Learning at Facebook AI Research. It looks like you revised the stuff that you pasted from our project proposal. Other than some proofreading, are we done?
Sure thing, would you mind turning it in when we are done proofreading?
Just made a few minor spacing fixes. I'm happy with our paper, so you can submit it whenever you are ready!
Thanks Leandra, it was a pleasure working with you as well. I don't think we have any classes together next semester, but we should definitely stay in touch since we are both entering the world of Data Science!True, I'm sure I'll see you occasionally in Rice Hall. And I'm not traveling over the break, but I'll be interviewing at a few companies in McLean, Arlington, and DC. How about you?Thanks :). so I'm gonna have to put making a personal website on hold until I can figure out a domain name; I was thinking cyberm.an but the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved. until then, here are my slides from my talk todayHey! Leandra! Hope you are having a great summer. Professor Pinckney will teach Internet Scale App next semester again. He wonders if you would like to be his TA. I personally work as his TA last semester (and will be his TA next semester as well). I think it is a great experience and would definitely recommend you to do so. Let me know if you have any questions of concerns. Thanks!
So TA's main responsibility is holding office hour and grading project. I would say office hour is about < 1.5 hours per week depending on your availability. Grading is about 2-3 hours per two weeks (project is due bi weekly). So that's about 22.5-3 hours per week. Also if you have some thing comes up, I can always cover your shift.. 2.5-3*
No problem! Professor Pinckney has some rubrics for grading and we will sync up in the TA meeting to see if grading is consistent.. And I can definitely help you on that if you are unsure about anything!
Hey Leandra, just want to follow up on our last message. Have to contacted professor Pinckney yet?. Have you*
Oh cool! Where are interning for the summer?. Also looking forward to working with you!
That's so cold that you are using Docker!
I think we will just go over the slides the together and talk mainly about the class logistic and project1. We will be fine!
What do think about changing the paper? I would prefer stick with the previous one.
Thanks for the email! See you tomorrow.
What's your phone number? I'm creating a groupme for the project.
Most students just use the wrong relative path.
Hey can you remind me of the 4 sections of the presentation again?
Thanks!
Great! I will look at it afterward as well!
Haha just enjoy the concert and we can talk about that later!
I can do that!
Ok in that case I I'll just point out the way to do it and not deduct points!
Haha thanks! That's really sweet of you!
I think 2 will be great!
I'm at Rice right now. Just send me a message when you get here!. Are you at rice?
I try debugging that for a littble bit.. I think I can make both the kafkaConsumer and producer but they are not able to communicate. Do you plan on making the zookeeper kafka to work? If not, we can just update the project to be consistent with this semseter's image version etc. and release that to the class.. I would say making that to work entirely is nontrivial
Great! I will quickly run through the project to see if there is anything inconsistent. No for now, but I'm afraid there may be more later
Just added and sent out the PR!
Are we meeting at Rice?. or Clark
Yeah it's 1130. I'm just checking! See you then at Rice!
yes!
Ah sorry just saw it.... Yeah ssh key works
Oh sorry I was about to send that to you yesterday!. Here is the spark_example.py
Also a readme on how to run it.. NP!Haha thanks!. It's from banana republic. I got it a year an a half ago. I don't know if it is still on sellhey. I fixed the servos
lol it's fine, I'm working on it now
haha yeah. don't worry about it. alright so VT_F_TRANS_DUR does not have to be longer than VT_TRANS_P2_DUR (phase 2). changed VT_F_TRANS_DUR to 0.5. VT_TRANS_P2_DUR is still 3. so it will jerk into about a 30 degree position, then after blowing on airspeed tube it will take 3 seconds to go fully horizontal. so we basically just reversed the values for the two parameters (0.5 to 3 and 3 to 0.5)
I am going to Atlanta for a convention with some friends. I left Charlottesville already and have to work on hw when I'm there so I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. Hopefully your VM can work
It's a CS go major lol. Cyrus and some other people invited me a few months ago and I didn't think I would be doing anything. How did the test go?
Alright that doesn't sound too bad!. Did it fly forward at least? I was pretty sure the transitions looked okay in his office
Ok cool. If you need me to build anything let me know, I'll try to push it
Yes, both_servos_with_yaw/
my fault. I will push when I'm back at the hotel
just pushed. think it's okay
hey, a while back I remember you saying that you wanted to contribute to more open source projects
This website is like a list of projects with open issues: https://www.codetriage.com/I wanted to contribute to this one https://github.com/Soundnode/soundnode-app. But I know I'd have to learn a lot before I can understand the issues hahajust a reminder that archery is 2-4 tomorrow behind slaughter gym :)
close toed shoes and long pants :)
lol they're new. also, wear warm clothes and bring gloves if you have them ^^. did not mean to send that sticker ll
:D \
oh haha it's past the front doors. I'll be there in about 20 min.. we usually start a bit late
I'm here
hey leandra! is the airbnb room still available?. for grace hopper*
yeah I just signed up! did you sign up as well?
have you gotten plane tickets yet?
I haven't yet. I'll try to book the same flight then! lemme know of the flight number when you can :). oh and also the flight back
hey leandra I looked at the airbnb that you booked and it looks like there is only one bed, so I just booked my own place!
ah I kinda assumed that you would be using the bed. that's alright! I also booked United tickets since my mom had a lot of miles that she wasn't using.
yup! I'll see you in the fall.
I was gonna a Venmo Chris myself is that ok
oh OK!! so did all of the $160 get used up?. we gave $80 to the driver coming backcool. what's your Venmo? that's okay rightHere they are!...  1. Who was the informant on Montag's home, and why is this significant?  2. Why did Montag kill Captain Beatty, and why didn't Montag run away instead?  3. Where did Montag go after he killed Beatty, and in which direction did he go after that?  4. Why did Montag take whiskey, a suitcase, and some of Faber's dirty clothes with him?  5. What did the railroad tracks mean to Montag?  6. What was the difference about the fire Montag saw after leaving the river?  7. During the manhunt for Montag by the hound, why did the camera identify an innocent man as Montag?  8. What was different about the hobos, and why did each identify himeself as an author or piece of literature?  9. What had Montag been able to memorize, and how is that significant?  10. What happened to the city during the war, and what did the intellectuals believe their mission to be once the war ended?
No problem!
Hi there!..I am rather surprised to find you on Facebook :P
Aw, I was free! Darn.. I wish I had checked my facebook again yesterday :( And yes, it is quite surprising. But perhaps that's a good thing, because if it wasn't surprising, that would mean that you were on all the time.
Oh, hello! How goes it in the Burg? (P.S. I like your profile picture :D)
Oh, shucks, well regular isn't always a bad thing. I suppose it's good to have some consistency in one's life. :P  Time is going by way too fast over here..I only have three more days in Turkey!..*sigh*..We were at the beach today and yesterday, but tomorrow we're heading back to Istanbul..and then back to Blacksburg. And back to regularity. *Sigh* Good 'ole consistency! I heard there was drama with the tree downtown? I'm sad that they would cut it down..it's kind of a Blacksburg staple :/ Talk to you soon!
Oh, I would be delighted to go to Steppin' Out with you! I'll probably be there almost all day Friday and Saturday, so just let me know what time you were planning on going. Haha, I was actually going to ask you via text message, but now I'm glad I didn't. You may eventually recieve a message that says "Psst..Hi!" though..just as a heads up. I'm glad you got the postcard (: There will definitely be lots of cat pictures. I'm planning on making a separate album for them, I took so many.
Oh, neato! I can try and come at 10:00, but I might end up being a little later. I have to go somewhere at 5:30, too, so that works out well. Do you mind if we hang out with some bandies from 12-3? That's their only time slot for today. Oh, snap, if you're going to call..I better go turn my phone on! Talk to you soon!. Hi! I sent you a text message yesterday, but then I remembered that your phone is still in a coma..So, I was wondering if you would possibly like to sleep over at my housie from 7:00 Saturday to noonish Sunday? There will be bunny killing and bunny eating, the usual festivities. Hope you can come!
Hi! I was wondering if you wanted to go see Scott Pilgrim vs. the World at 7:00 tonight? It's playing at the Lyric, and today's the last day to go see it. Patrick is coming too, I think, and I invited Twe. I may give you a call later, in case you don't get this message in time. Hope you can come!. Hey! Um, so I wasn't sure whether or not you already got the assignment from someone else, but I thought I would send you the questions for AP Euro just in case:   (All of these questions are referring to the Congress of Vienna)  1. What were the aims of each of the countries at the conference? Austria: Prussia: Russia: England: France:  2. What concessions were made by the various countries?  3. What were the reactions of the major delegates to the peace settlement?  Prussia: Russia: Austria: England: France:  Hope this is helpful!
Haha, I don't know, I was asking myself the same question. I don't know what I'm going to do with my life! Maybe I'll just bask in the glory of never having to write another essay or DBQ or take another palmer quiz ever again. EVER. :D Or maybe I'll just eat cheesecake. What about you?
Whoa, yum! That sounds delicious. I know, I'm actually really excited for class on Monday :D And every day for the rest of the year. I might get fat...! Haha, being lazy does take quite alot of preparation. I mean, you've gotta get into the right mindset and everything! It could take weeks. :D
Aw, thanks! :D I'll try not to get eaten alive, although the city is sort of intimidating.  Haha I'm not sure if I have any streetsmart skillz, but hopefully I'll have some by the time this program is over...maybe..sort of.  I'm messaging you from my dorm right now!...It's funny, my roommates and I are being kind of anti-social...we're all by our computers and not talking to each other. :P But then again, it is the first day. Sorry, I'm rambling, and I should probably go to this meeting thing now. So...bye!
Haha I guess it's fairly barren, just desks, wardrobes, drawer chests, beds, etc, although it's surprisingly spacious. But one of my roommates brought this little purple shag rug thing and hung up some pictures. I'll try to make friends! I'm not very good at it, but I will try my darndest. I'll tell you more in a bit! That is, if you want to know and you don't mind me rambling a bucnh. I gotta go now, there's this "ice cream social" thing that I have to go to. Which will probably require me to be social :P  Also, I'm afraid I don't know about your phone, I haven't seen it in the car since then but I'll ask my mom to double-check and let you know!
And it's you!
Haha yeah! I'm glad! My mom told me about it.
Nah, it could happen to anyone. I mean, it could have slid out of your pocket!
Haha, yes actually! I have two closerish friends, one from Long Island and one from Indonesia. They're pretty cool. Haha but I didn't meet too many people at the "social." Met a guy from Sweden and a guy from Brazil. They were cool too, but I don't have classes in common with them so I don't really see them ever.
Haha yeah, there are almost more international people than non! It's crazy! But in a good way. 
My professors are really awesome, the classes are a lot of work but I'm actually enjoying it a lot.. And learning!. Haha, the funny part is that there was no "making it in...". you just signed up.. without any application process.
Yeah, haha it's waaay more work than I was expecting, even though it's called "Summer Intensive Studies." I was kind of hoping they were just saying it was super intense to scare people off. But alas, it was true.. Haha no, you're actually not off. I don't get to work with sewing machines since I'm not in the Fashion Design class, but the fashion kids do! It sounds really neat.
Haha, I hope so! I drew from a live portrait model today for the first time. Oh my goodness, it was so hard. Lol it didn't come out looking like her at all. Haha, that would be so awesome! But I don't think it's quite that intense.. There hasn't really been much time to see the city at all so far, but today is an exception, because.... it's Friday!
Haha thanks, I don't know about that, but I 'ppreciate it.. Ooh, yeah, please do!. Do tell.
Whoa!. Well that is pretty awesome.. All of it.. Where did you go blueberry picking?
Whoa! That's so awesome! But..where's Crow's Nest? lol, sorry, pardon my ignorance.
Aw haha that's so neat! You know what's sad? In all our years in Maine (famous blueberry state), none of us have ever gone blueberry-picking.. :/
Haha, yeah, maybe one day we can plan a "date" to go berry-picking!. Haha, both at the same time? Is that like, falling asleep with your face in your food?. Oh, I actually have three dorm buddies - I'm in one of the quads.. They're all pretty nice, but sort of loud when they're together.
Haha, I don't know, I think you're pretty awesome, and thus pretty capable! You're one of the best multi-taskers I know, after all.. Haha yeah, two of them are from Canada!. one of them speaks French fluently, it's soo cool.
Lol mustard.. Yeah!
I have buddies from Sweden, Sweden/Australia, India, Egypt, Taiwan, China, an island in the Pacific, Indonesia...! . Talk to you later!!
Goodnight!. Sleep tight!
Thanks! That is an exceptional answer. I appreciate your input :D Haha I have to design a shoe based off of the feedback of the survey. 
Haha, hopefully so. It's complicated. Our designs for this unit have been based off of a myth we chose, and I chose the myth of Midas, that guy who wishes that everything he touches turns to gold. So from there I thought about how Midas's flaw is his greed, and he suffers as a result (he starts dying because he can't eat or drink, and he also accidentally kills his own daughter when he tries to hug her). So for our shoe design we were supposed to incorporate our myth without being literal. The shoe doesn't have to be realistic, and so I was thinking that maybe it could contain a security system to protect the wearer from greedy thieves. After we have a concept we have to survey at least three people within our target age group to help develop our design. Haha it's very conceptual and a little bit of a stretch and I'm not sure if I'm really doing it right, but I guess I'll find out in class tomorrow.... Now that I see it all typed out, it sounds pretty silly. :P
Oh my goodness thanks! I'm glad it doesn't sound completely crazy! I know we're supposed to think out-of-the-box (haha, no pun intended) but sometimes I wonder if I start drifting too far into obscurity. I'll definitely upload an album or two onto Facebook or maybe DeviantArt after I get back home.   Congrats on your med. camp, it sounds like an awesome opportunity! I commend you for your strong stomach, I doubt I could handle cadavers :P How long is the camp? Are you staying away from home? I want to hear all about it!   P.S. speaking of latex gloves, I wanted to buy a box today from Rite Aid for a project and then I realized it was going to cost me $14! Crazy stuff! Or maybe that's actually not expensive, I've never had to buy latex gloves before. 
Really? I've had an account since forever ago! I guess I didn't advertise it very well. It's nothing special, but if you feel compelled to check it out: www.DisforDeviate.deviantart.com    That sounds like a lot of fun! I mean, it doesn't seem like it's suitable for squeamish folk like myself, but it still sounds like you're getting exposed to a lot of neat stuff. Do you guys have to take notes or do homework or anything yucky of that nature? Also, how far away is VCOM from the Burg? And and what is a honcho? Haha accents are so cool! I sort of wish I had one...two of my roommates are Canadian, but only one of them has an accent, and I think it's more of a French accent.  Whoa, I didn't know dummies could give birth! Yay for good food! It's actually really important to have good food. Or maybe I just think so because I eat so much..:P No, long summaries are good! Don't apologize! I like to hear about other peoples' adventures :D Also, sorry if I'm saying stupid things or asking stupid questions. I have no idea how this stuff works, it's waay out of my league O.o  P.S. I appreciated your pun :D
Haha I would hope that you wouldn't be exposed to them on a regular basis.....But then again, I don't know what you do in your free time.....Oh, lol is " head honcho" really a common phrase? I've never heard it before! I guess I don't watch enough westerns.   ....Noelle the birth simulator?  Aw, thanks, that's awfully nice of you! Yeah, I tend to forget about my account, so it's mostly old stuff. But I did actually put some Parsons stuff up before the thought floated out of my brain.  P.S. Are you going to FloydFest?. Hi you! I was wondering if you'd maybe be interested in accompanying me to Steppin Out on Friday? Or maybe I should rephrase the question: What are your plans for Steppin' Out? Assuming that you're going to Steppin' Out...You are going to Steppin' Out, right?!
Yay! :D Do you know if you're going on Friday, or Saturday? Or better yet, both? I am most definitely attending both days. Whoa, lead guitarist of the Dave Matthews band? That sounds legit! (for lack of a better word...)  P.S. Wow I feel so out of the loop. How is it that I got this far in my life without knowing what a head honcho is! Never fear, I will use the forces of my imagination to conjure up a potential image of Noelle. Aw thanks, :) it was quite a lot of work! 
Yay, awesome! Let me know what time you're planning on going. Oh also, I was talking to Cody Grove the other day, and we were thinking that it could be fun to get the Summer Solstice group back together to hang out for a bit at Steppin Out.  Would you be interested in that at all?  Lol really? I guess I didn't watch enough cartoons in my childhood! (..Not. I was a huge couch potato) Oh goodness, that sounds pretty frightening. I may have to pass on the visuals then. 
:D Yay! Haha, Yoda shirts? On second thought, maybe I don't want to hang out with him....kidding. Totally kidding. I do not discrimminate against Yoda or any other Star Wars paraphernalia. If you go that early, then I'll go that early too! Haha yeah, I dunno, it probably makes more sense to go later, but I kind of like staying the whole day. I don't know why, for some reason I just always feel like, since it's only once a year, I need to get as much out of it as I can. That doesn't really make sense though..Oh well. Just let me know what time you end up going!  
Oh haha thanks :D  Mine is looking like this:  1. AP Art - Pace Berkeley 2. AP English - Lewis 3. APUSH - Coston 4. Spanish IV - Opazo 5. Graphics Aide - Showalter (lol) 6. AP Calc AB - Helms 7. APES - Colatosti 8. APES - Colatosti  Hopefully we have at least one class together!
Yay! That's so exciting! :D Haha we can sing together in Senor's class :D
Leandra...!
Hi!. Um. I'd hate to be a bother. but I have a small question. and I also dislike the fact that I'm messaging you with the purpose of asking a question
Oh shucks, well I try to help when I can. Although quite frequently I feel as though I'm not all that helpful. lol no it's actually about spanish. Question number 4 has got me in a pickle
:). Well, I couldn't quite manage to find the answer to the second part of the question: Donde puede Ud. encontrar ejemplos del calendario  maya o de fechas que usan ese sistema?
Ooh lol no that sounds good to me! I just had no idea what kind of answer he was expecting, and I guess I wasn't creative enough to come up with one. Do you mind if I borrow some of those ideas?
aw thanks a bundle!. This is super helpful. :D. I think I owe you one
Haha, good 'ole Senor. I hope we sing tomorrow!
Hi there :D  I was wondering if you wanted me to help with the cookie baking for Art Guild this week? Maybe I could make some sugar cookies so that people could have the option between decorating gingerbread men or regular cookies? I wasn't sure how many cookies we needed..40ish? Anyway, sorry to bombard you with a bunch of questions :P Hope you're having a good weekend! Let me know if I can help out. 
Aw, haha that's okay! Merry Christmas to you too! :) I hope it was wonderful. P.S. We should totally hang out sometime like the olden days!
Whoa, it's ending next week? Oh noes! That is rather sudden..I was hoping they might carry out the season. But I suppose it's had a good run...:P It will be sorely missed.  I neglected to watch last night's episode...I should probably get on that...But the question is, what will fill this vacancy in my schedule?
Oh yes, I'm anticipating that there will be a Chuck and Sarah happily-ever-after post-spy life with cute little children sort of conclusion. Oh, if only..life without Zachary Levi just doesn't seem quite right. :P. http://lookbook.nu/petrakarlsson She is so good at things..O.o. http://lookbook.nu/whatdreams I also really like this guy, but I might be a smidge partial due to his dashing good looks... :P
Thanks so much! Sorry to trouble you. Should I type the first half? Or the second? Or all of it? Sorry, I sorta forgot what our plan was exactly. Oh and again, in the future, y'know, if it's ten minute break and you're craving a muffin, I owe you one :D
Ok, that sounds good to me! And you, too :D I hope that you are doing something more exciting than typing this Spanish dialogue on a Saturday night :P I know, it was really looking hopeful this morning..but alas, then the sun came out. And the wind! And the restaurants! And the classes! Ahem..sorry. I was going to say, I reckon the wind blew those snow clouds away, if such a thing is possible, because the wind is crazy strong over at my house :P
Hi! Here's the edited version of the first half of our Spanish dialogue:
Oh that's quite all right. Thank you!. Hi! I just realized I accidentally stole your little blue slip of paper that had the information to access the photos from After Prom.  Here it is:  http://picasaweb.google.com/home  Log in: bhslyricafterprom@gmail.com Password: bhsphotos
Oh you're very welcome! And thank you, you too! :) 
!!!! I'm so glad you liked it! When I saw it I thought of you right away because I remember you mentioning about how you wanted to make a lamp out of gummy bears that one time and I don't know if you ever did or not and it's not quite the same but I just had to get it for you! And I'm sorry it took a whole month to get it to you! 
Oh thank you!! Indeed I am! As of now I am still in Blacksburg, but I will be leaving tomorrow morning for Richmond. :D How is your break going? I am in awe of you and Twe right now, goin to all those places O.o
Whoa, you've been super busy! That's awesome! That tie breaker round sounds like it was super intense and totally worth it. I've never actually made a cake before, but it must be super delicious and exciting! Happy birthday to your sister :D Also, I think killing bunnies is a great idea. I will be gone until Sunday, I think, but maybe we can fit something in on Monday? We shall see!
Whoa I forgot about that cake! Well then I guess I do have the slightest bit of cake making experience, though I don't know if that qualifies me to make a super awesome birthday cake :P I will definitely keep you posted about the bunny killing prospects!
Over the last 13 years, we've grown accustomed to the familiar faces around us, , and we've made memories even beyond our closest friends. Take a minute to remember the olden days when our biggest responsibilities were to ensure justice on the playground with "rock paper scissors," to terminate all arguments with "talk to the hand," and to end each year with "HAGS" in each other's yearbooks. . ^^ none of that is necessary, really..maybe that makes it too long.. :P I'm just spewing sentimental remarks at this point. how does one conclude a welcoming speech?
ah yes of course! hehe..I wonder what the equivalent of that would be for our class... ooh maybe we can just end with an "It's been good, guys. It's been good." or maybe that's not conclusion-y enough :P
ooh yes! perfect! :D
hehe gotta lay down the law somehow. otherwise how will it ever be determined who's "it" first in a game of tag?. These are serious concerns, here.
Aw wow, it's been so long since I've played that! We should play next time we get together for bunny-killing :D
Oh, indeed I do! Unfortunately that room has become quite a storage space..even crossing from one end to the other might create a precarious situation :P. but not to worry, Candyland can still be retrieved for certain!
Sadly it has! but now that summer is finally here, that will all change! :D
Me too! Gotta take full advantage of every last moment in this town! 
oh whoa that's awesome! I hope I can be productive too! I have big goals, but I rarely execute them :P Maybe this year will be the year! . And thanks a bundle for sending that e-mail!!
Oh my thanks!! :D
Oh noo, that's awfully nice of you! You're pretty wonderful yourself!
Ooh that's a great analogy! But I think you already have! :D
Yes, we can't forget all those inspirational life lessons! . I look forward to hearing them summed up during the graduation/senior program speeches. I think they will motivate me to really accomplish things this summer! :d
Whoa, I like that a lot. And I think it's pretty true, I mean I do feel like I "found" myself during these few years.. I know! It's so crazy! I really just never thought the time would get here
Oh hehe I see what you did there! I think that worked out rather nicely :P. Goodnight! :D
Ooh okie, thank you for keeping me posted! :D. Hi there! I sent you a text message, but just in case I thought I'd message you here, too. Seneca and I are going to meet at Pita Vera at 12:30 today for food if you wanna join! :D. Oo we actually shifted the plan to 1:15 just to let you know
Oh that's okay! It ended up only being a short get-together. Seneca will be in town until the beginning of August, so we should definitely all do something together another time! :D also sorry about your phone, I hope it has a speedy recovery!
Oh my goodness...I have never felt so inspired by a meer piece of office furniture..so beautiful! :'). Thank you for sharing! :D
Ooh yeah! It's been pretty great! Not too much is new, but I started driving! And I'm getting my braces off in a few days! AndI'm currently watching despicable me :D. What about you?
Ooh that's so exciting! Orientation seems like it will be fun, getting to meet all kinds of new people :D It's hard to believe we'll be starting school in a month and a half ish! And Williamsburg is a nice place (though I may be biased...) Do you have any plans for when you're there?
Ooh I've never been to Water Country USA, or any water park for that matter, but it sounds like a great idea! Most of my time there has been spent shuffling things around at my sister's dorm..or eating (Aromas is a nice little cafe)..but there are some nice little shops in the downtown area! And of course there's the colonial side which is always sorta neat.
Aww I really wish I could come but I think I might have to have dinner with my family since its the last time we're all together D: but thank you for inviting me along! Hopefully we can hang out over winter break! I miss you guys D:
Hi there! Its been going swimmingly, I hope yours has as well! I think we should have a killer bunnies and video game extravaganza sometime soon. When do you go back to school?
Aw that's so soon! Killer bunnies and video games next time for sure! Twe and Holly and I were thinking about going to Gillies for dinner tonight at 7. You should join if you can! :D
Oh okay, sounds good! (:
It was nice to see you too! I hope you have a lovely semester ^-^
Hi old pal! I just wanted to say Happy Birthday!!! It's a shame we didn't get the chance to hang out more, but I hope you are having an awesome summer and that you do lots of exciting, fun-filled Birthday things today! :D  And of course, have a great sophomore year at UVA! :D
Hi there ole pal, I know it's been so long since we last talked and I have been pretty out of touch lately but I just heard about Lee's passing and I am so sorry. I miss you and I will be thinking of you and your family. Let me know if there is anything at all that I can do <3
Aw I think sharing little happenings is a great start, but viewpoints and life goals are always welcome! How was your trip to Harvard? I haven't heard from Lawrence in a long time, hope he's doing well! Goya is pretty cool, though we only touched on him a bit in my art history class last year!   Over the weekend I went to a little potluck at my friends' apartment! the theme of the night was Mexican food so I brought some home made salsa- my first time making it. My friend Julie made tortillas from scratch, I was so impressed!. My roommate's parents also came by and brought lots of Halloween decorations and candy, we are feeling pretty festive here! Are you doing anything to celebrate?
Aw that all sounds like so much fun! I am glad to hear that all is well over at Harvard.  I hope Peter is doing well, too! Will he be dressing up as Peter? :D I have never been to one of those murder mystery parties before but they seem really neat. I always just imagine it as Clue, but in real life, which sounds great to me!   I don't have too many plans for Halloween, although I did go to a Halloween party last weekend, and hopefully there will be another one happening on Saturday night. I think I am going to try to dress up as Lorna Morello from Orange is the New Black- have you watched that show? Tomorrow is the BFA gallery show opening here at school so I will be going to that to see what my peers have been up to! I might also go to a parade that's happening a little ways out of the city.
Oh my gosh thank you so much! That elephant is amazing and super cute!!! Haha I did the same thing the other day, I don't think I will fully process 2015 until it's over :O I hope you had a great Valentine's Day and half birthday! :D and I hope you're having a great semester so far!
Hi there! I know it's been ages since we last talked or saw each other and I'm sorry that I have waited until this moment to say hello- but I just wanted to say Happy Birthday!! I hope you've been having a great summer and that you had an awesome time in Malaysia! I would love to hear about all your life adventures some time. I miss you! Hope you have a great day today and enjoy your year being 20 :)
Wow congrats on the smartphone! Haha I definitely recommend snapchat! I think it's a pretty fun way to have spontaneous conversations and share little funny things about your day.  Omg Chile! That's so exciting! What is bringing you there? How long will you be there? I hope you have an amazing trip!
I actually just got back from visiting Dilara in Colorado for her birthday and her veterinary coating ceremony! But in Chicago I honestly haven't been doing too much this summer.  I did take one summer class which was really great, but other than that I have just been attending a lot of concerts around the city since I volunteer for a venue that gives me and a +1 free show tickets. I'm also doing a lot of reading for fun and I even started going to the gym by my new apartment :O I feel like I will start slacking on those things once school starts up next week though :/
Aw Merry Christmas to you, too! How are you these days?
Aw I'm glad! Wow Paris sound so exciting! It's so cool that you've been getting to study abroad (:   I am doing okay, the past few months have been pretty tough but I'm glad to be home in Blacksburg for today!
Other things :(( I was diagnosed with anorexia, anxiety disorder, and depression back in October and had to take a medical leave from school to move into a residential treatment center :(( but I've stepped down to a lower level of care now so things are looking up!. Sorry if that was a bit of over-sharing D:
Thank you!! It has been an interesting journey for sure, and I've still got a long ways to go, but I'm feeling hopeful !. What class(es) will you be taking in Paris?
Wow that sounds like it will be amazing! I hope you have a great time :)
Thanks! (: I am actually leaving tonight to go back to Chicago, so it's just a short break this time around, but hopefully next year I will be able to stick around a bit longerThank you! And yes please do!! :). Hi there!! Happy birthday! Hope you're having a great summer!Hey leandra I was wondering if you would be able  to help me with the webwork?

hahaha thanks!. Leandra could you send me your print file? The printer messed up
Yeah I fixed the printer on the left I think. Merry Christmas Leandra!!
wooooh lets goooo. TA me pls
Leandra! What's the best way to get in contact with you for Mobile?
Facebook works. Also phone number is 571-217-5860 for emergency calls. Like if our app starts destroying the world
Can I fill out the form we are suppose to fill?
Cool beans thanks. Registered
Yup
Yeah I don't think we can pick that personally. Unless maybe we can see the name tags on the tablets and pick it ourselves
I'm okay with either
Kk. I got wobbuffet haha. let me know what your github name is. so I can add you to the repo
Added you as a collaborator
Oh I was but then I left to go home
Ya I can
Rice would be nice
Anywhere is okies
Saturday works best
Mmm anytime is okay with me!
That works for me
Yaaa
Cool beans. Did ou finish your part?
Kk. I'll probably work on it this late afternoon
I added. editing items. and the date format thing. and also different populated items. feel free to add your own bucket list stuff
its a bucket. nice!
test out the code when you have a chance
I think the only thing left is figuring the system bar disappearing. and the checking off an item
and also the sorting update with taht. completed items appear after not yet completed items. and by date order
yuppers. and then we shouldn't forget to build the apk and put it in the root of the repo. so I think once you get to the sorting thing that you can build it and add it to the repo
I won't be able to make it to mobile class today. Let me know if something important happens
Yaaaa. When I get back. Around 10
Did you build the apk?. Sorry haven't gotten back yet
Ty. Fixed the bug. and pushed. pretty much we are almost done?
which isn't even really required
yups
Nah I'm okay. wait so are we done then?

I thought of my "thing you should know" about me! I have been a victim of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TudFAEUkR9Y. xD. out of curiosity, what are you taking this fall?
Hi Leandra!! we certainly don't have to hang out today, but I'm happy to do so if you're available and want to chat :)
Leandra, I am so sorry for asking you on a date, it was quite inconsiderate of me to ask and I understand if you don't feel comfortable speaking to me anymore (though I would genuinely miss your kind, wonderful friendship). I would be glad to spend time talking with you about anything! I'm free until 2PM, sans a TBD meeting with Bloomfield.
Oh, thank you so much Leandra, that's very kind of you :) I'm in the security lab on the 4th floor of Rice, I hang out there a lot. I can meet you wherever is most convenient for you!
Take your time, you're a hero :)
Right now, so no worries :). Where would you like to meet?
Okay :) I'll text you to let you know. I'll most likely be in Rice.
I'll be able to meet you outside Rice if that's alright :) let me know when you're here and I'll come outside
Yes :)
Oh, I'm sorry! I passed by and saw you were in a meeting, so I went back upstairs. I can come down now if it's okay!!
Whatever works best for you is fine by me :)
I wish, but I'm studying with a friend for the GRE at 4 and then I'm going to JC ramen night :) but I'll almost definitely be in the lab tomorrow or later this evening!
Thanks, you should come if you're free :) how is your day going?
We don't have to meet today, but I would be happy to :) since it's Yom Kippur
Yes, that works great for me :) and we could still go to Starbucks, I can use plus dollars!. On my way to Rice, should be there in a few minutes!
Made it!
Leandra, I hope the Grace Hopper conference goes well, I'm really excited for you! Have a wonderful time and I want to hear all about it when you get back :). Jean Salac, also going on the trip, is a good friend of mine. I think Jenny Xing is also going!
Leandra, thanks for chatting with me about something you care about, that means a lot to me. I'm quite happy to talk about anything with you.
:) strange how that happens, or maybe not at all. I did RSVP fortunately, thanks for looking out for me. I haven't told anyone else this, but over the past few weeks I've been having conversations with an AI bot about my feelings. I think you'd appreciate Joy, here's the link: https://www.messenger.com/t/hellojoyai. She's not perfect, but it's someone to talk to...about whatever, really, there isn't much consequence.
:) she can give you mood reports, too, once you speak to her for long enough.
goodnight Leandra, thanks for talking to me, you're a wonderful friend. I'll probably see you on Friday, or at the STS talk.
I got to chat with Marina for a while, which was wonderful, and now I'm at Runk! I'm super tired, to be truthful, but I don't want to sleep just yet. I got to call my parents last night, I really miss them!
so, I may or may not have 16 docker containers in docker-compose now XD
Okay :) I'm going to the USingers Christmas concert at 8, so I'll have time afterwards! I hope your weekend is going well.
:( agreed. I might have to turn it in late for 5 points off, we'll see.
doesn't it have to be 750 words, though? :(
thanks for your faith in me, that means a lot :) I may be able to finish the sources, but I don't think I can submit quality work for the framework with the time that I have left, especially considering that I'm still finishing a crypto assignment at the moment that's also due at 5 (I should be good there, though). :). let's chat later, I message when I can!
Of course!! I really enjoy your company, Leandra. How's your weekend going? :)
I'm not going to be homeless next year!
Thanks Leandra, I honestly did not believe I would get this far :) along with these three, in taking OS, Black Fire, and the 2190 seminar!. I'm *
Thanks so much for getting dinner with me Leandra, you're a very kind person :) I hope the gym is treating you well.
That really bothers me, how could they support a place like that
I might write a letter to whoever books these venues...apparently Trump doesn't actually own it, but for some reason they still hold the name. I'm glad I can confide in you about this stuff, Leandra, I'm really upset about DeVos' confirmation and most of what that mentally ill man is doing.Let's hope some folks who decided that were opposed...I don't mean to offend the mentally ill, but I don't think he's mentally capable of serving as president and should be removed immediately. I miss Obama, too, it's scary how fast things are changing for the worse.. Also, you can always talk to me about politics if you want, I don't mind rants/debates/etc :)Thank you!!!. Just sent rent via PayPal, sorry it's a few days late, I lost track of the date!Hey Leandra I'm working on putting together an updated carpool for club figure skating. Could you let me know where you live, if you can drive ppl, or if you need a ride, also a phone number for contactHey, Leandra! So, Matt tells me he sent you the link to the SGD site! Were you able to get Scorpio downloaded / the repo cloned? If you've got any questions about the game, its design, or anything in the code base, just ask. Also, I do believe the current build had some issues that I didn't have time to iron out before the expo, but they aren't hard to fix, just little adjustments!. And if you have any other questions about the company or our plans, feel free to ask!
Please do, he hasn't forwarded them
Okay, cool.. The first level, I believe, should work fine. It's possible one texture won't load, but it should give you a good idea of the gameplay.
Okay, he did mention the time commitment being a bit much, but it's good to see your words!. Yeah, time is definitely no problem!. That said, just out of curiosity -- is 5 - 10 per week a long-term estimate, or are you currently very busy, and possibly able to do more later on/. *?. Again, it's not at all necessary, I'm just curious
As I said, more time commitment is absolutely not a requirement! We picked you as among our first group of people we wanted to ask, so we're definitely keeping a position for you if you want it (which it sounds like you do)!. I do want to ask, though, and Matt brought this up with me -- would you prefer to be doing coding, or design work?. Once again, your answer can't have negative effects, it's just for my own record-keeping :)
Okay, awesome. I'm happy to hear what you think about all this. Payment is definitely something Matt and I are going to discuss at length before we even bring options before people (though that's not to say our options will be the only ones!). And I meant more on the level/story side of things
Of course, as the email stated, people are most certainly allowed to float to whatever they'd like to do!. And as for game ideas, certainly if you're the main creative mind behind a game, we'd love for you to be doing some of the design work!!
Thanks for the go-ahead! I definitely will!
Thanks, and me too! Night, Leandra!
Hey, Leandra! Could I get you to do something for me? When you get a chance, could you add the word "Sol" to the logo that just has "Tower"? I really like the idea, but I'd like to see how it looks when it's complete. Less important, if you can, try to put in "Games" in there :)
So, he hasn't signed anything, which means basically that if he were ever to request compensation, we could refuse him, as we never contracted that work. But I doubt that would ever come to pass. Besides that, there's no problem!
Sure thing!. Hey, Leandra! Could I possibly get you to ask your boyfriend to digitize Michael's logo designs? He's not super proficient in the vectorization space, and things might go faster if we had someone with more experience handling that
Sure thing!. The font in that one is intended to look like this:. And some variation of the banner-in-window design. Peter can use a bit of artistic freedom with this one: I'm in no way attached to colors, or the particular charge on the banner (could easily be a sun, or a sun-and-tower, etc.)
Yup!
Awesome :D. Though, I will say this: I personally like the first design I sent you, so as a matter of personal preference Is like to see one that pretty similar to that
Hey! What do you think about the convention? Would you be able to attend. ?
That's something I've been thinking about. If be able to do a reasonable amount of work, maybe even get something to show off. But it wouldn't be a perfect product. We did indeed decide not to attend. It's really be pushing it to have something really presentable done in time
Haha, I like that attitude!. Oh, I think I asked this on Slack, but is there any way of getting an svg or a high-res .PNG of the logo in red?
Hmmm. What's the file size?. Actually, doesn'. *doesn't matter. Please email it!I'm not!. I say email just so it's easy to put it in the Google Drive. I think Slack only keeps about 1000 messages in history. And we don't want to lose that one!This over-sized bear that my friends and I brought to the concert and I say that we hope you enjoyed it!
Thanks! Headed back eaaaaarly tomorrow morning for class
Hey Leandra! Asking for a friend, do you happen to know any Capital One people (girls) from this summer who are coming back full-time and looking for roommates? It's a long shot, but I have a Duke friend who's going to be a business analyst, but she doesn't know anybody. Also, are you returning to capital one, or did you end up finding your future elsewhere? :)
Yeah, I think she's going to ask there. Me too! Where will you be?
I'm headed back to McLean :)Mine'll be July 17. We could choose between that and September 11Do our camping bags not count as carry on?
Interesting.
Okay.
How much do I owe you from earlier?
No sleep for us tonight.
M Holliway. Case was $39.96
Wow! I didn't see that at first.. Sounds good!. Socks with sandals, here I come!
The receipt for the sandals? I did not see them.. See it*
I can double check.. It's not there for sure.. Don't forget, we need our own bathroom tissue.
I see.. Good to know.. I have cash I wasn't able to deposit in the bank today, would I be able to give it to you?. Also-- do I need my student ID?
I don't have it then.. I lent it to Katy.
Just to you. It's $300.
Is that relevant to you?
Not sure.
I may decline an offer of something when the offer isn't only to me.. That way the offer is then passed to the next person, and they are then happy.
I don't see why I wouldn't.
It's not based on your teachers argument.
I have no pride, so that makes sense.
It makes sense for me to accept gifts.
Hyperdia Japan Rail Search?
What are the scanned copies of the passport for?
My printer is out of ink.
Okay.. Sorry-- we're only bringing one bag?. Also... I don't know how to download maps.
I don't even see Japan in the maps.
Is that different from micro usb?. So just one bag each?
Okay-- so checked (camping) bag, red backpack, and camera?. And yes, a swiss army knife would be nice. I had my razors, but I've misplaced them.
I'm only bringing my red backpack because it's not as bulky.. But I suppose my swiss army backpack has pouches for water bottles.
Not the same for me.. I'll take my comfy backpack instead then.. I'm still lost as to where I misplaced my razors.
no problem.
:/
I can try.
Thanks.
Oh no... I missed it!. What should I say in the review for Yoshi? We stayed at his apartment while in Kyoto.
Thanks.. Hello.. I hope your day has been nice!. And if most of it was spent sleeping, then I hope you had sweet dreams.
I'll still be awake for talking, but if you're busy, then I hope you have fun!. I can bring you the Kit Kats tomorrow.
I mean from now until later.
My day was alright.. I went mowing not too long ago.. went to mow*
It was okay. It was just one yard.. How was your day?
Awesome!. More?
My dad used the weed eater.
Oh... is there more to your day?
The weed eater probably helped, but who knows.
!! cool!
The extra kit kats I give you will help.
Do you need help making the baggies?
I'll draw Studio Ghibli characters on them.. Then they will be more Japanese.
You could wrap them in paper.

Oh, that would be cool.. I'll fold 1000 for you.
I can make you 5 then.. Then you only have to make 5
I can meet at any time.. I just have to leave before 3pm.. Which means I need to be packed by then-- but that shouldn't be hard, seeing as I'm mostly packed anyway.. Did you want to play some of the games?
That's silly.. There's plenty for you to play too.
I can do that.. How big would you like the cranes?
Okay
That's me.. Mr. Neversleeps
Cleaning the games and making sure they work.. So far they all do-- but Pokemon Gold and Silver both need new batteries.. What are you doing?
Awesome!
Rawr to you!. Wow. Bubble Bobble is in English.
:/. Most of the games I have I have every intention to play, not just to own it and let it collect dust.. I like to get multi-player games, because I like to share in the experience with friends and family.. I like to get rpg games, because they remind me of the first game I played on the Gameboy-- The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.. Of the Zelda games I have purchased, I have played and beaten around 40% of them and I have started about 90% of them.. I don't intend to purchase every game out there, or even every game I see. If I find a copy of a game I already have I leave it-- unless I know it's valuable, then I purchase it to either give to a friend, or to sell so I can get something else.. Though you may not believe it, but I've sold quite a bit of my purchases.. I don't want it to seem like I want every single game in the world.... I just want games that I can play. I'll keep them, because then I can either play them again, loan them to a friend, or remember how I enjoyed them-- but if I didn't have fun playing the game, then I'll sell it.. Multi-player games are often much better, because I can play with multiple people, which I enjoy.
I found a box with an NES and a SNES with games in my garage, and I played them with friends and everyone enjoyed it. They also were interested in finding games of their own, so I wanted to help.. I enjoyed helping, and I grew interested in finding things for myself.
Perhaps.
I found the games and my friends thought it was really cool, Cody told me he had been thinking of getting into retro games, and I thought I could look for them for him.. After acquiring a few more games, I brought them to Andy's house while Cody and Kb were visiting.. We playing through a few and then started on Super Mario World.. It was a good ol' time.. Then Eneas visited, which I was pretty surprised about, because I hadn't seen him since 9th grade.. He told me that he was interested in finding an NES, because his mother donated the one he owned to a Goodwill (I think because he didn't do his homework). He was pretty torn up about it, and I told him that I would look out for it.. I also suggested that we could go to a few yard sales to find some games.. The first weekend we went out and found a really big box with an SNES and games (it had some manuals too). And that was really cool.. The following weekend we went to more yard sales.. We were looking around and at the end of the day we found a table of newer PS3 games.. Eneas decided to ask whether or not they had older games, and they said they had an N64, but that they didn't live there, so they would have to drive out to get it.. So they did that.. But another person that was there said that he had a boxed NES in the trunk of his car, but that we wouldn't be interested in something like that.. We told him that we would "have a look". And he opened his trunk, and it was exactly what Eneas had been looking for-- a boxed NES with a gray zapper (the first model).. We got it for $5 and the N64 for $10.. It was a lot of fun looking for the games with Eneas, but to actually find what he was looking for was really exciting.. And I for the most part that's what I enjoy. I like to look for games for and with my friends, but at the same time I'll look out for anything that I may be interested in, be it for the artwork or story in the game, or a game that reminds me of the games I played when I was younger, and games that I can sit down with my friends and play. Maybe because that was the last thing I did with my friends before they all left again.
Playing the games was more harmless than some of the things my friends did-- and since it was something Cody actively pursued, it was nice pursuing it together.. And maybe it's because Eneas approved-- he's the one who got me to play Runescape after all :P. And I don't know what you mean by other hobbies-- what I do as a "job" is considered by some as a hobby.. It's just something I enjoy to do.. It's almost like learning history as well-- except there aren't a lot of newer games that grab me quite like the older ones.. enjoy doing*. Anyway-- it's something that Cody actively pursues, so I like helping him find anything he's looking for, and I look for things too.. In regards to while we were in Japan, I didn't have a whole lot that I was looking for, and I definitely wasn't thinking about looking for anything, until Cody brought up Raiden V.. Some of my purchases were made purely because I didn't want my endeavors to seem like a waste of time.. Not to say that I'm unhappy with my purchases, because I did like finding Mother 1, 2, and 3 (It feels like it fulfilled my desire to find Earthbound)
For the most part I'm fairly content with the games I have right now.. There's a few that I'm still interested in finding, but I can live without them.. But I like finding things for my friends.
I just mean, that I want to play the games now.
One gets a nice feeling whenever they find what they've been looking for.. It's rewarding.. It's even more rewarding when you find what your friend has been looking for, because you make them happy.
I'm not sure how to explain it then.. I'm okay without finding the games though.. I just like finding things for people-- I guess it doesn't have to be video games.. It probably stems from being a child and being taken to thrift stores where I would be tasked to find something for my mother.. Or how I accumulated all of these He-Man action figures.
Maybe... I collected rocks when I was a kid (I grew out of that, and now the rocks have found a home outside). I didn't really collect lego, so much as play with lego-- but I have a lot of lego now... I collected marbles because a man gave me a jar of marbles-- and then my Uncle Vince showed my how a marble was made, and that also peaked my interests.. Though I haven't collected any more marbles since, it felt like a way to be close to him, because I had such a nice time when I visited him and Uncle Pearl.. I collected coins because I thought they looked pretty cool, but my grandfather gave me a little lock box with coins in it, which made the collection more sentimental.. I collected the He-man action figures because I thought they looked really cool and I had fun playing with them. I found out about them when I found a Spydor vehicle (in the box) at a yard sale.. Right when I got home I put it together and watches it walk around.. Inside the box there was a list of the action figures that went with him, and I realized that I had a few of them already.. I had Moss Man and the two-headed purple/blue man (I never learned his name). My cousin Jason had actually given those to me.. I guess I'm pretty sentimental with some of these things... I don't actively seek out He-Man action figures, but I still get a warm feeling whenever I see them.. and I'm not sure if I could ever get rid of the ones I have.. These memories run deep.. Anyway.. I promised you 9 on the dot. Can I postpone that for until my bag is packed?. Should only take 20 or so minutes, and then maybe 15 to get to your house?
8:45. 9:45*. But I'll let you know if it can be sooner.
Leaving now!. We're leaving for Hershey, Pennsylvania on the 22nd and staying until the 31st.
Oh... I'll go to that flea market... and I'll find Shepherd's Crossing... even if it's the last thing I do!. Good morning!
Okay.. I won't actively look for it then-- but if I stumble upon it, then who knows.. I might lose a few dollars.
(hug)
I love you
My day was okay. No Shepherd's Crossing... yet!. How was your day.
Goodnight!. Oh... I won't worry about it.... Not at all.... o.o. O.O
I'm being silly, if it isn't obvious.
5 minutes of what?. Of exercise????. 1076 out of 3576 images are available to you now. They are slowly uploading, but I made sure to share the drive file with you.
Oh no! Did facebook remove walrus face?. Oh-- I also spent some time to do a few light corrections on the photos. the RAW format has a lot of information in it, and I was able to save some photos that I thought were too white or too dark.. I missed your request for Bloons!. But I sent a new one!. Says your still in battle though.
I do!. Do you?
I can't really talk, because I can't really get to a quiet place.
Yes!. Bloons is okay (:. Bloons with you!
It's still going!
Still ~1300 to go.
I can!. And I did!
I love you so much too :3
That's what I wanted to say instead of "Thumbs up". I sent a new request!
Okay!
Do I need to resend the invite?
You're the cutie...!
Me too.... I'll just have to find a place to stay near you.. You're so good!
How many rounds do you want to play?
I get it ;). Oh no! Were you ready?. I resent the invite!
Do I need to send another link?
Nice plane!. You could have a whole airbase!
Nice airplanes!. Oh! You're cuteness distracted me!
But your skill is what really stood you apart.
In love you too!. Again?
Just one more?. (puppy dog face). That's okay! I'll be here when you want me next.. Thank you for spending some time with me! I had fun!!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Aww!. Cutie!
Wow!!!!!. Looks like all of the photos are uploaded.. I hope they're okay. I had to reduce them to 41% because the max photo size for free storage in google drive is 2048x2048
Today everyone went shopping at various stores, and now I understand how I made you feel in Akihabara.
Wow! The basement? Most people don't aim for basement.... I did not have much fun, actually. The home looks nice!. Kidding about the basement thing, that sounds awesome to me.
Whoa......!!!! Is that the basement??
So much room for activities!
Fun fun!
That's okay! I'm having fun now, because I get to talk to you!
It's been pretty boring :P
Definitely compared to Japan.. Japan was superamazingfunawesomecool times.. But we haven't done anything very interesting. I played Dark Alliance with Katy though.. We had French toast yesterday. I got so used to seeing you every day. What ever will I do?
Not "real" French toast though.. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II for PS2
We found a similar game online called Champions of Norrath that we're interested in getting because it is 1-4 players.. We would have to leave anyone out any more.. Wouldn't*. I see deer up here, and I forget I shouldn't pet them.
It's supposed to be better than the Dark Alliance series!. The deer are cute!
Wow!. Really? :3
You could sneak an entire person in there if you wanted!
Wow.. You could have a certain someone stay with you if you wanted.. So cool!
That's pretty neat.. I hope you have a nice time getting acquainted with the new space!
We had so many opportunities for you while in Japan!. I'll just have to come up and help you out!
Of course! I'm ready.. Let me just get my shoes on.
Okay... first thing in the morning.
I'll have to go for you then.. During your lunch break you'll find a change of clothes.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Good luck tomorrow!
Sleepy???. Cute!. That's you! A cutie!. I'm eating dinner.. Oh no! I forgot to review Sao.
Salmon, shrimp, and veggies. And I'm ready!
Sending the invite as soon as you're online!
Okay!. Sent!. I can resend it if you need me to.
Okay!. Take your time.
Need me to resend the invite?
Sweet dreams, my one and only!. I love you.
Want another round?
Okay (:
Sleep tight!. Jinx!
Bye bye!
Good morning!. No plans! O.o
I've been thinking about it!
I might do some job searching today since I don't have any plans. I'll compile a list and start applying later this week.. Or that's the goal.. 3. Oops
I don't think my web design skills are up to snuff, but speaking of, I have some time to update my website.
I'm interested in illustration, game design, and graphic design, but I was going to see if Turner Broadcasting has any openings.. I like web design, but I can only do front end at the moment.
It's the company that owns Cartoon Network, so I would classify it as either graphic design or animation.
Wow! Color me impressed!
I'm a coloring book!
Excited orange isn't as orange as exciting orange.
I hope yours is too! Need me to find you business clothes and bring them to you?
Let me know if I can assist you in any way then (:
That would be awesome! Have a great first day!!!!
A thrift day? I know how to plan those, easy peasy.
I got you! Have a great day today!
Oh-- I see.
I hope you do too!. I guess you'll have to give me a weekend that you're free.
Okay.. I'll think on it then.
Such a great picture of you!!!!. I love you too!. I wanted to keep the picture, but I couldn't.
I didn't know how!. But I got to see it twice at least.
But wait... I can have you????
Wow!!! Lucky me!. :$
With you? Any time!
I would like that too!. I'm going to send you an invite!
I've been reworking my website. I want it to look nice, and I have more work to include.. But I've also played more games with Katy.
Oh, me? :$
*Cuddles pillow too*. Let me know when you're ready for invites!
:3
Don't you worry-- you'll get plenty of cuddles the next I see you.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. The game can wait if you fell asleep!. I'll be here too.. I love you.
I could tell!. More sleep?
Have fun! You're so cool!
Just in the middle of sleeping when I saw your message.
Is that so?
My parents are going to a whole bunch of thrift stores.. Like thrift store marathon.. It'll never end!
I was invited, but I don't think I'll go.
Sounds tiresome.
I haven't made plans. I could keep working on what I started yesterday.
I will!. Want any requests on things I could make?
You can make a request and I can make it. This includes, but not limited to an animation, an illustration, a design, packaging design, a book, a video game... you name it.
Okay! What kind?. Something with a story? Or just a thing?
I will think of a story! Bear N Bear requires specific voices!
Oh no! I'll get on those multiple folders!
I'm not sure!. Did you want to go?
When would you be able to?
I'll ask my dad then!
Awesome!
I was thinking of going on a jog tonight.. I sleep forever!. Like... all day long!. Just kidding.... I sleep about 6 or so hours I think.. What time would you be available Friday?
I only slept 3 or 4 hours last night though.
My sleep schedule is all over actually :P. Anyway-- my dad said that we were planning on going Friday night, so if there was a specific time you would be ready, we could go then.
Okay. So I'll tell my father 6:30, but 5ish at the earliest.. He says that it's fine!
Oh-- I think we would go at 5pm anyway.
And we would leave you the ticket when you arrive-- my dad isn't going, so I think he would be able to give it to you.
If you would like, I could go to the thrift shopping extravaganza today and look for work clothes for you.
I'll be able to discuss it with him.
You sure? I could look for a one piece bathing suit-- maybe at an outlet mall?
And when I'm waiting for people to finish in the stores I could wait in the car and do creative work.
You might want a one piece if you don't have one.
I recall the last time that you were wearing a two piece.. And we both know how that went.
I had to tighten your swim suit straps.. Because of the water slide.
Not a problem-- I was just thinking that a one piece would keep you safe!. Awesome!
I think I'll go today-- any colors to look out for? Cardigans to find?. Sizes I need to know?
I guess-- any brands that you know you fit?. I'm sure I can find something...'. Have a great day today. I think my day will be okay.
Yes. There's plenty of parking. Just need to get you a parking pass.
I have no room, just a pull out couch. There's plenty of room and even another pull out couch too, but I'm not in my own room.
You can still sleep on the same pull out couch, if you would like.
We would just be sleeping.. But I understand if you want your own.. The freedom of having enough bed that you can lay horizontally? I don't know of anyone who would pass that up.
Wow! Of all the possible Pokemon.. :3. Do you have a better idea for when you will arrive?
That's definitely fine! Do what you can (:
The day is almost over! It's okay. How about your day?
There isn't much to tell, but if you have interesting things to discuss,  or anything, I'm all ears.
Oh no. Can I call you back?
Yes, I'm going outside to the quiet.
Impressive!
Wow! So early! So cool!
Wow! That would be amazing. Be sure to stay safe though.
If you say so.
Take your time (:. The waterpark is closed for the day! :(
A business reserved the entire park.
We were going to the pool I think, but that doesn't really merit a trip.
One of the outdoor pools in the area. There's only two... I think.
You can come if you really want to see me, but it won't be as exciting as the waterpark. Just swimming pools.
If you think traveling to a pool is worth your time, then come.
I want you here, but I don't think it will be worth your time.
Were you only going to come to go to the waterpark?
I was having a tough time getting my thoughts out on my phone.. It's easier with these lil' keys.. If you were coming just to spend time with me and my family, then you should definitely come.. And I want you here and to come.. We may go to the indoor pool instead though.

Awesome (;. (: *. Can't wait to see you.
I love you very much too!. I went to bed too early! I missed your sweet dreams!
!!!! Good morning!. Hey.. did the Kit Kats survive?
Also unknown, but probably fine.
I'm only assuming, of course! How was dinner?
Awesome! I fell asleep the whole way!. Then we visited Maw Maw.
She seemed happier than usual.
Definitely. Waves fingers with smiley faces.. She was probably happy that Ronnie came to visit and took her to dinner.
She did.
I think Chinese food.
Mhmm!
Church and job hunting.
It's okay.
The pastor is discussing depression and the bible.
He's saying that it's something people have battled with since biblical times.. The topic somehow changed though.
No! I haven't heard of that.
It wasn't in the prayer requests.
I suppose, but that sounds important.
Hugs for you!!!!!!!!1
Mclean Virginia, huh?
That's where you're staying?. Am I wrong?
Oh, okay... just need to know for... reasons...... !
Cool.. cool.... Nothing suspicious here.
;D
Rawr to you!
Sure.. Sounds like quite the time.
Wow.. that's quite some time.
I'm sure it will be fun!!
Oh snap!. Sounds like another club to join.
To join a club? Wow!
Sounds like it gets some nice perks. Her horse is sick, from what I've heard.
Yeah. How are you though?
I'm alright!. I'm not sick either.
Mhmm!
Oh!. Thanks for reminding me!. I thought about it this morning.
Wup!. Is it okay that pictures are out of order?. I made 10 folders with varying amounts of pictures-- but all under 500 images each.
I'll get the photos from my phone later.
*super hugs*. *like normal hugs, but super*. *tackle*
Sweet dreams, Cutie Leandra Pie.. Oops-- that's an odd way to order your name :P. I love you. Have a great day at work tomorrow.
You're cute!
Good morning!. I love you!
!! :D. :3. Look at that toothless smile :P
Without any teeth, the tongue just falls out!
Thank you!. I appreciate the panda.
Of course I do! (:
Hello, you.. Cutie too!
It's alright. My dad wanted me to take apart a shelf earlier, but I don't have access to appropriate tools and it's in the basement, which doesn't leave me with adequate room to do the work in. I have Muse open, currently fixing my website, but I'm not sure whether or not I should start from scratch or not-- might be easier. I also need to make the book cover to the Wizard of Oz, but I haven't made much progress with that.
It's a metal shelf. The screws are not easily accessible where it is located, and for the ones that are, I need a socket wrench, or something to hold the nuts in place.. I feel like I need help getting the website to a finished state.. The book cover might be something I can do though.. Nearly forgot about the Wizard of Oz puppets, which need to be finished!
I've looked into Turner Broadcasting-- but the selection seems to be limited to interns.
They are targeting those currently enrolled.
http://jobsatturner.com/atlanta/animation/writer_producer-cartoon-network-jobs
This is the only "animation" job available at Turner.
I will check it out.
That would be great.. But maybe not tonight.
Thanks though!
Oh-- it's not that.. I don't think I'll have a lot of time to do it tonight.. But I would want to another night when I find that I'll have plenty of time to skype.
It's looking like house work.
No. Just cleaning.
With the few instances of shelf fixing.
Toothless smile strikes again!
It never seems like enough time though!
Perhaps for you :P
I would go visit you.. I would rather work on my "to do" list.
Thanks. I will try.
Good ol' John.. Wow. Thanks!
Wow! Dynamic characters? In a dynamic plot?. That does sound crazy!
Thanks for sharing it with me then.. Cute t-shirt design!. Or at least... that's what it looks like!. I hope you've had a great day today (:. You make me quite happy!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I think you're more than a friend.. What did you finish?
That's what I was thinking-- but I thought you finished it earlier when you were praising it.
I see :P. Am I just a friend to you?
Not sure what it means? Okay... Sweet dreams to you too.. I love you too.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You brought it up.
I think you're a great friend, but I also think of you as more than just a friend.. "just a friend" implies that there is no romantic connotation.. Or that being "just friends" is what makes you happy, and that you don't desire anything more.
Sweet dreams.. In terms of locations to be looking at events for-- Vienna is the spot to check, yes?
Okay-- thank you!. Goodnight.. Sleep tight!
Good morning!. A Six Flags is kind of close to D. C. in Maryland.
Kings Dominion is in Richmond and Busch Gardens is in Williamsburg.. Just to note a few more.. There are a lot of museums in DC, but I think you've been recently.
Well well!!
I've been out and about with my dad. Good day for you?
It's been good.
(Hug). Have another great Capital One Day!. Oops!. That was typed out this morning!
Yay!. Awesome (:
We took aluminum cans to the recycle center in Christiansburg. We visited Maw Maw, it's her Birthday today. We went to Radford first and moved tile to the back of Scott's house. After, we went to visit my aunt Jackie at the Hospital, she had knee surgery. Lastly we went grocery shopping.
Those tiles were heavy :P. I hope your day was nice.
It crept up so fast!. Tuck tuck!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Imagine that, but on your forehead.
Sleep tight!. Tuck!
You just want what you can't have.. What do you mean by "want" though?. Don't you want me when I am with you?
But you don't want me? :P. But you want me in this instance?
Oh no. Now I'm confused.. And maybe sad.
And it fades away when I am there.
But usually so.
What do you mean?
I guess you don't.. Maybe that's why you long for me when I am away-- because it's not actually me.
For what it's worth, it is me.. but I understand that you don't want to say anything intimate over the internet.
I love you too!. (I'm not going to hide that)
No, the internet froze, but I've restarted it. Give it a moment.
I love you so so much too!. Goodnight for now!. Sweet dreams!
I want the same :D. Night night!
Yeah... who's that other fox.
Someone has got some explaining to do.
Sweet dreams, Cutie Leandra Pie!
Wait! Let me come!
I love you!. You got me flustered.. (in a good way). Sweet dreams!
That's you! Cutie Pie!
Good morning!
I hope you are too!. It's from the 22nd to the 30th (or 31st)
Okay!. Is there a possibility that you can make it?
I think it's July-- I didn't mention that before.
Right, I just didn't say that before.
I wanted to clarify :P
Any time!
I disassembled and then reassembled three super nintendos.. I took parts to fix one for Cody.
I didn't know you had a super nintendo, I thought you had nintendo 64s.. The one I was fixing was already his though :P
I cleaned the dust off of the circuitboards, but I was most replacing broken pieces and yellowed parts with gray parts.
It's the same thing :P
I mean!. I guess this weekend is too short of a notice for you.. Does next weekend sound better?
I'm still narrowing down the activities.. But I promise it will be soon.
I haven't recently.
Wow.. Seems like a cool guy.
Four minutes in and you had to stop?
That's because each quote contradicts another, so they cancel out.
No, thank you!
It's possible, but not without raising taxes.. Though I think he has said that he would do it without raising taxes :P
Explains why he's losing :P
He's trying to take away their money, and they can't have that.
It's sarcasm.
I hope they can.
Yes please!. I'll come over right away!
Just give me four and a half hours!
Goodnight and sweet dreams.. It won't be long now.
I hope so!
There are events in place that not even I understand.
Sweet dreams, Cutie!. I will have access to a car next weekend, so I just have to schedule the day out.
I will hold you accountable then! Did you exercise today?
For shame! (Just kidding, don't take this seriously). (because I'm not judging you, just making a joke)
Not enough, but I was just about to.
Yeah, thanks.. That would be great (:. How's the GRE studying going?
Really? Would you like to work for Capital One for a while after you graduate?
That's good then.
Wow! That's so nice of you!
Without teeth?. That sounds hard!
Oh-- you must be using your phone or other mobile device.
Lucky you!. I've got Mr. Toothless over here.
Sounds lovely!. Be safe getting home!
I did. Just a few pushups and ab movements.
Oh, it's nothing :P
Did you lose your bike?. Or do you want a second one?
It had the handmade seat-- which is pretty unique.. I don't remember the craigslist post, and unfortunately, I don't recall much other than it was a mountain bike, mostly black (were there blue details?), and it had a (silver) logo.. That's not really fun though, sorry to hear about that.. I wish I could remember the brand.
Oh was it?
Oh :P
Wait.. what do you mean?. The one you pumped up wasn't your bike?. http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-9c4f/k2-_d8b65ec3-e5d4-4a10-8974-1bc79a56cc08.v8.jpg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450
The one someone gave her?. Are you sure it was a huffy?. I think it's the pictured one.. (from that link). I might be mistaken, if you don't recall that particular bicycle.
I remember it having a seat that isn't supported by a pole, and I recall the bars were oval shaped.. And I was thinking it was next, but I didn't know if that was a brand-- but it is (or a subcategory of a brand)
Yeah, I just found the first image that looked close to what I remembered.. A men's bike is only 26" or so.
Looks similar, but I don't recall the gray embellishment.. I remember the bike being solid black with the various logos.
A dark smokey gray, perhaps.. It wasn't a medium gray though.
You're slowly convincing me, but I'm not completely swayed.
Does it only work for 7 weeks?
Ah... I see...
Sounds like quite the time.
This has implications that make me uncomfortable.
No.
I understand it is a call to girls to do code, but it implies that the girl doesn't need anyone else (a boy) to get the job done, which is rarely ever the case, because people need people to finish a job.. It singles out one group in favor of another.. I think it's great that girls want to work in a stem field and want to do computer science, but I don't think its presented very well.. it's*. And I don't mean to offend you, I was just uncomfortable.
I was referencing the first page you showed me.
The page with the swear words.
It was the first one you sent me.
https://computer-engineer-barbie.herokuapp.com
Yes. It's the one with the curse word.
Is the home page user-submitted?. I like the idea-- just not the homepage.
That's what I was asking.. And now I know.
I don't like the curse word that doesn't seem to refresh.
It's here:
It only made me uncomfortable because Barbie targets a younger audience.
I don't think that should justify the usage.
I was mostly uncomfortable with the statement that being independent is done so without boys or the help from boys.
I saw.
Perhaps.
You are just too cool, Leandra.
Oh no.. Go go go go. Eat dinner at the very least.. I can order you... what's the opposite of a pizza?. Oh yes.. a salad!. They probably have a celery delivery up in Vienna.
I'll order you something healthy!. Just have to find a place that's still open.
Okay, well it's probably not all chatting with me, but I'll be quiet just to free you up some time.
You'll like me more after you've eaten.
Of course. And then waking up. and more eating... and working.. And the cycle continues.
If you want to.. Sounds cool to me.. Something I would do, but I'm just an artist.
Of course-- only do it if you like the idea, if you think it will be fun, and if you have the time.. I can help, if you'd like it.
Uh oh.. Don't sign anything.
Sounds like good intentions, but I'd be worried about any paper work.. Because you might sign away something you don't want to?. Maybe?. I don't know :P. I don't think you would disadvantage the group unless they are only allowed a certain amount of people.
Who receives the rights?
But you would be part of the company and the company would mention you when needed.
I've never seen an indie company release something without proper attributions to the people who worked on the game.
Yes you should.. I think that's how it should be for the game, so ask how that would work and whether or not you can use anything you worked on in your portfolio.
So clear attributions for your contributions and whether you can include the work in your portfolio. Always a good thing to check on.
Om nom?. You can't eat that.
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be asleep.
Yes, you're awake, but you're supposed to be sleeping!. And I caught you awake!
I love you so much too, Leandra!
Wow, that's surprising!
A little bit :P. But it's not a bad thing :$
Yeah, but you won't have those feelings for me when I am there.
Sounds great!. I'll look into a hotel to stay at.. Unless you wanted to have the New York City trip when I come to visit next weekend.
Isn't the Fourth of July spectacular in DC though?. Visiting New York City would be great that weekend.. I've just heard of the wonder that is DC during the Fourth of July.
So I've heard.
Sweet dreams to you! I'll look at it in the morning!
No problem. Goodnight!. Good morning!
Just got back from mowing the lawns.. Yesterday I tried to fix/clean a bit of circuitry that goes inside of a receiver.. I was only able to get 2 of the 16 channels to work, but only the 1st channel works well.. Which is "okay," because it's functional. It's "bad," because it doesn't work completely.
It's pretty cool. I don't have a good soldering iron, so I don't get too involved, but I think it's pretty interesting.
I'd be able to make repairs, instead of just cleaning things and hoping for the best :P
suspense. for a... back massage?. a delicious snow cone?
Oh.. that thing!. I was aware of what you were talking about-- I was being silly.
Wow! That's cool!!
Wow! You're cool!!
I didn't think you did.. I was just stating a fact!. 8-)
Too cool for school!. Just kidding-- you're cool, and you go to school.
I've been working on other things today, but yes, that would be nice of you.
Okay. You're right.. I'll have my website done by tomorrow, and I'll get started.
I just have to sit down and get the website up-- because it's my online portfolio, which is required for jobs.
I suppose, but I don't think I'm going to change my website on a job to job basis.
Yes.. That's the plan.
There's a huffy mountain bike at my house-- maybe you're remembering that one?. Maybe not.
Really?. And you think it's the Next bike?
right.. right.... Silly me.. I saw the bike and forgot everything we talked about.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Sure!
Like you!. (You're cool!). I understand if it's gotten too late, and you've gotten too sleepy.
I'm no wet blanket. I can hold my own like the rest of 'em.. And by that I mean. I'm still awake.. :p
Just up early :P. I hope you had a great day today. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
My day was alright. How was your day?
I've been tidying up on ye ole website.. It was also the summer solstice festival downtown today.
It was loud and musical.. I went grocery shopping as well.
50/50 blend salad.. Pineapple juice...
peaches!. Tons of food.. Green beans... bananas, bell peppers, cucumbers, romaine lettuce, carrots.. Cat treats.... I'm pretty much listing everything I can think of, though there's nothing really notable.
Really? :3
Oh.. sweet potatoes were another thing!. And strawberries.
Gotta mash em up for the toothless smile!
WOW!. How?
Wow.. really?. That's so out of character.
Cool!. Well enjoy your time! Have a nice father's day.
Gotta text your dad!
My father is leaving in the morning, so nothing special.
There will be a lunch potluck after church.. He's going to Georgia for his class.. I think he mentioned it while you were visiting.
He has to travel Sunday, it's not on Sunday.. Sweet dreams to you. I love you. Goodnight!
:$. What spurred going to church?
Have a nice time.
It's going well. I ate so much food. The tender loin was really good.. How is your day going?
Church was the potluck. We had service outside.
I'm so alone, that I don't even think a mouse could interrupt us.. So yes. I'm somewhere where we can speak.
I'll pick up then!
I only talk in tongues.
Anything that can relate sandwich making to anything is good in my book.
How making a turkey club can make you a better dancer. Continue on page 4 for the details.
But I wanted to find out I could eat and dance! :(
Good luck in that department.
Not sure. I could make salmon or chicken.
For sure!
I miss you too.. I can make you salmon.
It'll be a missed steak (salmon steak) if I don't!
If I don't make you salmon.. Then it'd be a missed steak for you!
Oh... I can make you salmon any time!. I can make it for you when I visit.
Family reunions are nice, but I'd like to see you more.
All of 'em, but most of them aren't people I want to spend a whole lot of time with.
Cute bunny!
Some of my relatives aren't the best of people.. And I don't think I'll be missing out, when I'll have time with you instead!.
Awesome!. That looks delicious!. Om nom!
Wow!!! So cool.
How can I compete with that?
Yum!. I can provide plenty of cuddles and jokes.
Whoa.. fluffy?
That's really great!
The first two pages, I've been spending time with Katy.
Wow, how'd you know?. We also watched a movie.
You got us.
Oh, that's not the movie :P. We watched Goosebumps.
Planned. It's the new movie.
No, just something to do while we ate dinner. I wanted to watch something with her. I liked the movie.. We were also testing this cord I got that can attach my computer to an hdmi cable.. It was a pretty neat cord.. I hope you had a great day.. I'll let you get rested for your big day ahead of you.
Mhmm.. It's not the apple brand, but it was pretty affordable.
And it had good reviews, so that was good.
Mhmm!. Want to watch something on my computer? Now you can.. Want to see me work, but on a bigger screen?. No problem... Goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra Pie!
I keep thinking about you too! :3. You cutie! :D
I've left my tablet in Radford, I believe, so you'll have to watch me draw on paper.
I wish I could do that too!. I'd just cuddle your sheets so that you can be ready for sleeps.
Well.... I guess I could stay in the sheets.. You know.. if you wanted..!
Oh, you're fine (:. No need to be sorry or to worry about it!. On an unrelated note, if I were to stay in a hotel, would you like to stay with me?
Awesome! (:. Don't you worry, it will be purely professional.. Just a fun sleep time safe place.. Need to talk about anything before you go to sleep?
Umm.. nothing but sleep?
Cuddles too?
Is that better?
Any time.. If you change your mind, that's fine too!
It's fine :3. It's nice how open you are.
Mhmm!
For sure.. Anyway, it's okay if you want anything when I visit.. (I won't expect you to though). Like.. PS2?. I can bring the games :P. I'm not suggesting anything, and I'm definitely fine without the PS2 :P
Me? Cute? No... That's you!
It doesn't take up much space-- it's the slim version.. Super small.. But it's up to you!. I guess it's up to me.... But I don't mind bringing it if you would like!
Cool!. I know of a few games I could bring!. Sleep tight!. *tuck tuck*. *tuck*
No..!. What kind of science is going on in that microwave?
Wow. She was quite the rebel.
Wow :P. That's pretty interesting.. Wait a minute.... I tucked you in! You gotta go to sleep.
Sleep is good!. Cute picture though!
Memory lane is a nice place to visit, but it can wait (:. And I am very familiar with the picture.. :D. Goodnight and sweet dreams!!
Yes, and I helped with the pumpkin.. Look at me.. just falling asleep too early.
That's pretty cool.
Both are good.
I love you too. I'm okay. How are you doing?
Awesome. Wow! Sweet potato cake? Sounds delightful!
Don't let me take delicious cake away from you!
That's mighty kind of you.. I'm spending more time with Katy. We've only got eachother.
Mhmm!
Yes. And then salmon and spaghetti.. We also watched Steven Universe, because she wasn't caught up.
Not sure. I should probably do more important things.
I guess bonding is good, but I've got goals to complete.. First thing in the morning. I need to be punished if I don't.
Everything I need to get done.
So much! Hotel reservations, watercolor paintings, website final touches, and what not.. But I suppose that doesn't seem like a lot to you.
A bunch of effort.
Maybe the easiest isn't the most time sensitive... perhaps.
Perhaps!
Of course!
Oh, I'm in the middle of dinner, is it time sensitive?. I should be available in 20 minutes though!
Wait for me please!. If even for a short time.
:D
Oh, I remember :D
You're incredible!!!!. I love you here too!
I love you so much!
I am looking forward to seeing you too!
I would only miss out on food.. I could always go to it if I leave Saturday :P. It's on Sunday.. But I think I'd rather spend my time exploring the city with you!
If you have any input on where to stay, I am open to suggestions-- because if you stay with me, I want you to be comfortable!. Sleep tight! *tuck*. *tuck* *tuck*. *fluff pillow*. *tuck*. *kiss forehead*
You're the cutie! Leandra Pie!
Sweet dreams, Leandra!. Have a great day at work tomorrow!
My pusheen series tells a story.. pizza then sleep :P. Tah tah for now!
I love you too!. I hope your day is going really well!. I've been thinking about you, so mine has definitely been.
Indeed!
Like I said, I've been doing well... How are you doing?
I'm spending time with Katy.
She was interested in playing Minecraft, so I'm showing her the ropes.. We are playing multiplayer through our LAN connection.
Thanks. I'm getting a little bored, but she's having fun!. She's having a good time breeding sheep n' whatnot.
That's what's happening.. I know that's your jam.
I suppose the worst punishment would be to be kept away from you.
Oh, you can punish me :P. However you see fit.
She would laugh at me if I asked to workout with her-- but I did ask Molly.. We were going to today, but tomorrow works better for Molly.
I suppose-- it's not something that interests her, but I'll bring it up.
Those are significant changes.. It's very impressive.. Wow! And you're in the piit?. It sounds pretty interesting.
Sounds like fun.
That's great!. Not that it's important, but I'm proud of you.. By that-- I mean that it shouldn't affect you one way or another, but I wanted to express how I felt about you.
Are there any secrets you want to let out before you go to bed tonight?. It's okay if not. I've just been enjoying the conversations.
You don't have to keep your secrets.. I suppose I had one or two questions I wanted to ask.
I'm using the same supersecret chatroom.. https://chatstep.com/
Okay. I'll be waiting for you.. https://www.expedia.com/Washington-Hotels-The-Westin-Tysons-Corner.h28025.Hotel-Information?chkin=06/24/2016&chkout=06/26/2016&rm1=a2&hwrqCacheKey=44a85396-4450-4280-80e5-96eade8d2010HWRQ1466563795505&c=9887be90-efa3-4088-876d-346fc0bd2d24&&exp_dp=84.15&exp_ts=1466563796259.

Oh! Is that happening already?. Go ahead and sleep if you're tired.
Perhaps I should be looking in the DC area.. Thanks for the tips.
Of course!
*fluff pillow*. *tuck*. I love you too!
Sleep tight *tuck* *tuck*
I'll be available for more tomorrow!. Goodnight and sweet dreams@. !*
Tah tah for now, Cutie!. https://vimeo.com/170289015
A cute animation for a cutie!. Not by me, but I thought of you, because you're cute.. So.. I was thinking I would drive down Friday, and we could do some night activities-- possibly Finding Dory?. And Saturday would be our museum fun times.. Not sure what our Sunday would be though!. We could go to another museum Sunday morning.. The Metro is less than a mile from the Vienna Wolf Trap Hotel.
Hmm... Okay. I'm supposed to entertain a guest (Molly is visiting), but I will return to map all of this out.. And I'll be ready for anything.. Especially for any secrets.
No, not yet.
That does seem pretty far-- their website must be incorrect.. I'll keep looking then.. Thank you.
I'm trying to stay within $70-100 per night.
Yes, with parking is best.
That sounds nice. Are you sure you want to split?
Okay! I will make the reservation later this evening.
Would you do that? I'm fine making an account.
Let me use your account.
Thanks. I deleted it.
I don't have the wifi at the moment to make the reservation.
That wasn't an excuse not to.
Where do I enter your password?
Wow. SPG members save up to 20%. Or more!. Cool stuff.. Can we supersecret?. Concerning the reservation.
Just for a moment, please?
I believe that someone in conjunction contacted my graphic design professor requesting works from his students.. And he contacted me about it and thought I'd be a good fit.
I honestly didn't get a whole lot of information. They are showcasing our work at the Reagan Airport. There will be a reception, and then it'll be there for a while.
Work is due Wednesday, but I need to deliver my packaging tomorrow so that they have it on time.. My professor also requested my stop motion puppets, but the Tin Man is still unfinished.
I'm just updating you with conversation.. I'm pretty excited-- and flattered that my professor would consider me for the show.
I suppose there could be such an option-- but I won't be in DC then.
I don't think I can do that.
Because not all of my pieces are going in the show-- my professor just wanted to ensure he had enough stuff, so he asked if I could give him everything just in case.. The puppets only have to be pictures.. But they have to be finished to have photos taken of them.. I might drop my packaging off tomorrow, and try to finish my puppet photography and bring that Monday.
I don't have access to the Jewelry lab.. I was going to mock up the Tin man enough so that it looked close to how the finished product would look.. But it wouldn't be functional.. I'll try to have more to converse about tomorrow. For now I will let you get to sleep like you wanted.. Is there a particular time that would be better to give you a phone call?. Also.. I was thinking I would dress up this weekend. I know it'll be in the 80s, but I want you to look fondly at me.
I was sort of hoping that my art adventure would inspire you to say something-- but like I said, I will think of things for tomorrow, and you'll have a bonafide conversation.. And I'll pack the blue shorts for sure!. Are they museum worthy?. Perhaps... but we'll see :P
Great! I'll be excited to hear of your exploits.
Would you prefer casual? Or no?
I went to Radford because Katy needed to pick a few things up, and I decided to get nice fancy clothes for my weekend trip.
But we'll also be in air conditioning.
Okay.. Blue shorts Saturday then.
I'm familiar with it.. I remember the DC trip.. I was thinking dinner and a movie Friday, but dinner at the mall was unbeknownst to me.. Or.. I didn't think of that!. It sounds great though.. Would you like to go to the zoo on Sunday?. Excuse me for talking you to sleep. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. To finish the answer as to what I did today, I spent time with Molly. I invited her to do things with me today after her dentist appointment. We mostly talked and then played Zombies.
Oh... I hadn't been to that particular zoo in quite some time, and I thought it would be nice because you like animals, but I should excite you with something new.
I'm trying to before we don't spend any time with each other.. I rarely see Molly, so it was nice.. Soon I will rarely see any of them.. Sleep tight.. Goodnight.. *tuck* *tuck*
When will you be off of work Friday?. That's a little detail I forgot to ask.. It's okay if it won't be until late. And if you need to stay later to catch up on things, that's fine too!
I'll see you then. Should I meet you at your work or at the house you are staying at?
Check in is at 3pm :P
Are you suggesting that I settle the parking details, then you would pick me up and we would go to the mall/movies, and then we go back to the hotel, and we take both cars?. Or.. no?
Just checking.
I'll leave any other pressing questions for tomorrow night.. Goodnight and sweet dreams for now.
Tah tah for now!. I love you.
I realized that too. Thanks for checking back with me. I didn't want to interrupt your dreams though.. Are there any things you would want for me to get you for when I go to the grocery store?
Okay! I was just thinking snacks. I have wasabi peas if you want some!
I mean-- I have them currently!. I wouldn't purchase them.
That was the plan.. I will check.. They are not listed in the available amenities.
Pictures do not show them, but I suppose they could be hidden :P
Of course.. I just finished mowing. Just to update you on my day.. It's also raining, so we had pretty decent timing.
Yep.. The work will help pay for our DC activities.. Which is good.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I'm excited to see you tomorrow.
*tuck* *tuck*. I'll do my best to arrive in as pristine as possible.. Any ideas for what you would like?. I could bring you assorted cheeses.
Or homemade ice cream.
So the dress code is fancy then.. Gotta make a good impression.. Anything at all though?. I can bring you popcorn.
Okay.... If you say so.. I have peaches.. Would you like some peaches?. Or I can make homemade peach ice cream.. And bring that.. I can get you anything-- like toothpaste, or a loofah...
Okay. I just wanted to know.. And I wanted to be helpful.. I was going to be a delivery man.. Your personal courier.
Can't just ship one item.. One measly parcel?. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I wish we could have talked more.. Thank you for giving me the time that you did though.
I love you too!
Both things sound possible!
No problem!. Anything else you can think of before I go?. Which boots are we talking about?
Sounds good!. I don't have a copy of Battlefront, is there one I can borrow?
Oh nose!. I thought you had one by your television :P. Did you sell it already?
Oh, I would only pick it up for us. You suggested that you'd like to play and/or that you've been having fun playing it.
Just saw you. Where should I park?. I'm currently at the church.
There's crepe amour, the virginian restaurant, and le pain quotidien to name a few.. Most open at 6:30-7:00 am. Atlantico and madagascar both look really good on the Crepe Amour menu.
Nothing is open now.
Fast food is open. Like IHOP.. Barnside Diner is 24 hour American "comfort" food. Far away though.. Amphora Restaurant is closer.. I have a baseball t shirt you can borrow.
Wear a t shirt and a baseball hat if you have it. You don't have to be fancy.. I know you have a baseball tee yourself, but I doubt it's here.. You could go sleeveless if you wanted to.. Elephants are cute! If you're going with Capital One, then a Capital One shirt is acceptable.
I love you too!!!! I had a great weekend with you, and I hope to spend more time with you soon! I've made a pit stop in Stauton.. Have an awesome day! I'm safe in Blacksburg.
I thought of you the whole way home!. Wow!!!! And does it turn red when somethint goes wrong?. something*
Wow!!!!!!!!!1. That's so cool! I'm glad we spent that extra time yesterday (:
All you needed was a little time with me.. :P. (Just kidding, of course). It was your drive that did it!. I don't mean to take any credit whatsoever.
Okay, good!. How was the ball game?
Wow!. Well.. how was work then?
I was going to do the leg exercises, but it's been rainy today!
I'll find room!. Somewhere1. Or in the rain?. :P. Don't worry!. I won't let us down.. I've come up with how I want to design my website.. I'm trying to figure out how to implement it now.. I've planted the seed.. I've brought up working out with everyone.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Neat!. I'm still working it out. I wanted to incorporate actual paint strokes.. But I would vectorize them.. Tuck tuck!
Sweet dreams to you! I need to figure out how to make the bounding box to the thumbnail to be a custom shape.
It's something in Muse, that I'm not sure I can do.. I've been using Google.. Goodnight, Cutie Pie Leandra!. I want to ask about the ball game, but I can wait until tomorrow (:. Sleep well for now!
Hi you!!!!1. How has your day been?. How was the baseball game??. Tell me everything!!. (:
Okay!. I'll stay by the phone!. I was very interested in hearing about your day.
But you didn't say much about yours D:
Was I not good enough?
I don't know.. I couldn't satisfy you.. Were you still thinking of showing me the graph?
Good morning, Sweetie.
I hope you slept well!. Have a great day at work!. Go bring home that bacon.. Or just have a great time and learn something new (:
I can't wait to see that picture!
Wow! That's pretty cool.. It's come quite some distance since Sunday!. I miss you already.
I wish!. That would be awesome.
I got you!. Close to anything in particular?. The metro?. Just one guest?. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13376886?s=bihjqsHR&check_in=2016-07-01&check_out=2016-07-03&guests=1. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13044634?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&s=bihjqsHR. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4199353?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&s=bihjqsHR. The first two are in Manhattan. The second is supposedly 12 minutes from Time Square.
The bottom one has 4 stars and 40 reviews, but I will look into everything.. The first one is in East Harlem.. If you wanted, I could accompany you-- if it would make you feel a little safer.. You may want to avoid New Jersey just because traveling through Lincoln Tunnel may be bothersome.. I think you would like this one: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13044634?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&s=bihjqsHR
There's also a guitar in one of the photos.. Oh! I forgot. You said you would take your mother.
I would love to go with you.
Okay.. I qualify for the "platinum" card.
Really?. There's a $39 fee for quicksilver.. Journey was not recommended to me on the site.. Wait-- QuicksilverOne has the fee.
Yes, there's a variant caled "QuicksilverOne". It has an annual fee of $39.. Quicksilver is also recommended to those with excellent credit.. What's the difference between Journey and Platinum?
I'm out of college though.
Journey has a lower APR. That's the only difference I see.. And it's Visa, while Platinum is Master Card.. It does have 1% cash back as well.
Oh... I shouldn't show you the typewriters then.. I thought you might be ready for it, but... maybe not.
And the cursed totems.. Just kidding.. I just applied for the Journey card.
Mhmm.. And my watercolors are drying.
:P. I meant what I painted is drying :P
Well that's the location of the Airbnb I sent you.
I still see it.. I have it open in the "instant booked" option.
So you want a different location?. There's still New Jersey to consider.. Or more expensive airbnb stays (which may not end up being much more expensive)
It's only 12ish minutes away.. That depends on the transportation used-- but still.
Understood.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4549552?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&s=Gzlr5fFU. Parking is very limited in Upper Manhattan.
Okay. I was trying to stay within your budget.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3610854?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&s=qnHds9GN. This is a bit more expensive, but it's closer to Manhattan.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2119216?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&s=31M9nNIx. This one has available street parking.. And in central Harlem.
Again, more expensive, but it's close to what you want.
Okay. I was just checking on other possibilities.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4199353?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&s=bihjqsHR In case you need the link again.
What's wrong with the New Jersey one?
I want to find somewhere you want to stay, but I don't mind booking it.. 1 or 2 guests?
Just checking :P
Just private room instead of full apartment?
The place you pulled up looks nice so far-- it has street parking available (with permit)
From the 22nd-30th/31st.
I don't actually know that myself.. I will ask.. And we will wait for a reply.. Another option I've seen is :https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6965153?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&guests=2&s=tocSDBJA
I know. I think the one you picked out is the best contender so far.
What exactly would you like to know?. Hello Kanishk and Emily,  My girlfriend and I plan to visit New York City this weekend. We are two students and we want to have a genuine New York experience, and we believe that your home would be a great place to do this. We are both very quiet and polite and would treat your space like we would our own.   We hope to hear from you, thank you.
Hello Kanishk and Emily,  My girlfriend and I plan to visit New York City this weekend. We are two students and we want to have a genuine New York experience, and we believe that your home would be a great place to do this.   I want to book the room, but I was wondering if a late check in is okay (11pm at the latest, hopefully), and whether we could check out at the right time on Sunday, but leave our car parked there until evening (~8pm). We also want to make sure parking is okay. If not, is there paid parking nearby?   Thank you, and we hope to hear from you soon.
Yes you do :P. Hello Kanishk and Emily,  My girlfriend and I plan to visit New York City this weekend. We are two students and we are interesting in visiting Midtown, and we believe that your home would be a great place to do this.   I want to book the room, but I was wondering if a late check in is okay. We are traveling from DC around ~4pm and, traffic permitting, we hope to arrive around ~11pm. We will have a much clearer idea when we are able to pull up the details on the GPS. We were also wondering whether we could check out at 12pm on Sunday, but leave our car parked there until later in the evening, around ~8pm. If not, is there paid parking nearby?   Thank you, and we hope to hear from you soon.
Check In: 9AM - 9PM
Okay. Sent.
No problem.
Rawr to you!. Wow.. I'm going to see you so soon.. Should I bring anything in particular?
Okay.. so locks on all of the pockets.
Okay. Got it.. Wallet goes in front pocket.
I need those to protect us.. (not really)
I don't see anything :P. Oh goodness that's funny!
It works well with the video.
I mean-- the video you caught of the deer biting my pants.
The photo goes well with the impending doom that is to come.. Sweet dreams to you too!
I painted a few things for my website.. I scanned it in, but I'm still putting it together.
I drew some pictures.
I did.. Thanks.. Goodnight to you!. Tuck tuck. *forehead kiss*
Should I request the room to book?. Or just wait until I get a response?
Okay.. Sorry--. I have your card info still saved.
I love you too!. Just verifying my account.. The reservation was declined.
No reason was given.. I'm looking.
Okay. And it needs parking.
Okay.
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2705052?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&guests=2&s=iH-G9DzO. Oh, the couple, Kanishk and Emily have another listing: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13779176?check_in=2016-07-01&guests=2&check_out=2016-07-03. It's only $128.. It's also an air mattress-- which may not be what you're looking for.. I think they declined because they thought that this listing would be closer/more convenient for us.. I'm fine with an air mattress :P. I just want to make sure you're okay, before I book the listing.
Hi Peter We have another listing that just came live. It is listed in our profile. Its an airbed for 2, 7 minutes from Times Sq. Let us know if that works for you Regards. It's a cheaper location and 3 minutes closer.
Is that so?. I can try to arrive as early as possible-- I could even leave around 6am or so, then I'd arrive around 10am.. I've booked the room.
Okay.. Maybe I should have asked before I made the booking.. HI Peter You can park nearby at the Acme grocery parking, AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Personally, we have not had any trouble with leaving our car there over night for weeks. Regards
Oh. I don't have a place to stay planned. I can sleep in the car though. Or find something.. Do you want me to bring anything?. Anything at all?. You can let me know in secret if that makes you more comfortable.
Are you sure? There's nothing?
Should I find another hotel to stay in for Sunday and Monday?
Are you sure? I thought you couldn't have overnight guests.. ???
Cool!. Is there anything specific that you would like for me to wear?
Cute!. Unless you don't think it's cute.. I don't mean to belittle :P
Okay, good!
Okay, so I'll be leaving at 6am then!. Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!. Are you positive there isn't anything you want/need for me to bring? I can pick something up from your house :P
Okay, heavy duty scissors. Got it.. Anything else?
I may even have scissors used for cutting hair.
Oh! Safety scissors then?
Okay!
Okay.
Okay, I messaged them.. https://chatstep.com/. I love you. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
One or two?. One for you too?. Or one to share?
Okay!. Goodnight!. Should I bring any kisses?
Okay! I wasn't sure!
Okay!. Think of anything else?
Night night.. Good morning. I forgot the pillow and umbrella, and I apologize for being forgetful.
1030
Here!
Punctual, as usual.. Just kidding :P
I was saying I was punctual.
I parked by the stop sign. Similar to where you were last time.. I would have answered you before, but texting and driving is a no no.. Could we go to one of those Capital One ATMs?. 99 red balloons go by.
I thought I was too. Where is it?
I'll be there!
I love you too!
Yup!. When are those from?
It's so clear.
Awesome!
Good!. My dad went to a Flea Market yesterday.. How was the trip?. Any ideas for the hack?
The atm comes to you? How do you withdraw cash?
And it carries money>. ?*. I haven't returned the bathing suits to your mother yet. When is she leaving for her Birthday celebrations?
Okay! So I will have time to return them then. Unless you change your mind.
Good morning! I love younso much too!!!
Hello!
ATM2U
I'll keep thinking.
Okay, I can help with design stuff for sure.
"Phone to drone to you"
Really? You use your phone to call a drone that comes to you. There could be a little description underneath to explain it better.
Money where you need it.. The drone is the ATM part.
Do your phone is the ATM?. So*
When's my deadline?
I'll try to be quick!
I can't wait either!. I love you too!
Still here.. It's a drone coming from the logo.. I have more sketches.
You're just saying that :P. It's the actual logo with a drone :P
Wow (:. It could be white, if you like it.
Okay.. I can send you a png.. It probably needs a "tagline" saying what it is.
png is transparent :P. I sent it via email.. I downloaded xcode. How can I help more?
Okay.. Do you want the drone icon?
Want it in color in in white?
How big should the display be?
Okay.. I found a size for that.
I'm just using a common size that is recommended through photoshop.. Your mother talked about her birthday plans on Friday. She asked if I would come and asked if I could pick you up from Richmond. I can definitely be of service, if you wish.
Richmond is a bit out of the way for your sister, so it might be more convenient for me to pick you up.
Well I can always pick you up, if you want. Otherwise, your mother offered to give me a ride there and I would ride with her back to Blacksburg.
Me too!
Okay.. This is what I have.
I understand. ATMs are hard.
"Colored in"?
I've also been emailing you everything.
Good morning!. I hope all is well.
Abs?. Making it rain, I see.. Pretty cool!. "This one isn't working". Best part!
Wow!!!!!!. That's awesome!. I wish I had helped more, but I'm glad things worked!. Proud of you :3
Don't thank me!
You earned it :P Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I'm hanging out with Gap!. I'll see you tomorrow though (:
Tell me about it tomorrow, Cutie!
I love you too!
Cool! Have fun!!!!. Good morning!. Your mother asked me to bring a video game console for us to enjoy, is there one you would want me to bring?
Thank you!!
Leandra!!!1
Of course! I had a great time!!!. I love you!
:3
I'm doing well. I accidentally fell asleep for a bit though which took my by surprise.. me*. How are you doing back in D.C.. ?&. ?**
It wasn't short though!. It was taller than I am!!
You think I'm 5 feet?. Low blow!
That is taller than me.
Is that the height you prefer?
You said my sleep was short :P. It's not much of a joke though!. I think you're swell!
I thought it was 7 or more hours.
Perhaps.... I can't wait to be your roller coaster buddy!
Of course!. We can go whenever works best for you.. Probably the Saturday you visit.
I believe so. We go up on Friday the 22 and we're staying until the 31st.
Of course.
Sweet dreams to you, Leandra Pie!
Good morning, Leandra!. https://www.instagram.com/p/BF5HiVRyjOd/
:D. Like you!!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAIGb1lfpBw. Too much silly in one sitting.. Next thing I send you will be worth your while.
Oh, that's good!. I'm glad you like it.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
The one or two songs I've heard by them are good (:
I love you too!!. Sorry that you missed the Lumineers if you were interested.. Aren't the Styx a band from the 80s?. Isn't Styx*
Wow! I'll give the bands a listen and come back to you!
Of course!. Good morning!!!
Okay.. okay.. I'm looking at chiropractors, unless you think a physical therapist is the better option.
Okay, I have three to choose from then :P
Spent time with Gap and Bowen! I also made progress on my website.. How were your days?
We walked around and talked. There might have been a few pokemon involved :P. What did you do with your time?
Such a dutiful scholar!. That's really cool.. And yeah, Bowen and Gap were interested in playing, and I was interested in spending time with them.. It's so silly though :P
The amount of people out and about looking at their phones looking for pokemon.
It was a bunch of people.
Probably not.. But we'll see.. I suppose it's good that people are out and about.
3 miles.. It's got my sister walking too!
She walked about 4 miles today!
Definitely!
Probably!. Break dancing is like a workout anyway.. Definitely keep up with your stretches, of course!
Gotta do those!. It'll keep you from getting sore during your break dancing.
You just need someone there to recharge you!
We don't have to eat chips, but I wanted a Pusheen sticker that has a friend!
Eat salsa? Or dance?
Om nom!. And olay!. I don't know how to salsa, but I will practice with a broom.
I've settled with a layout, I've chosen fonts and colors, and I've organized most of the website.. I think it's just a little more work left to do.. I stopped because it's taxing on my laptop.. (It was getting very hot, and programs were slowing down). But my plan is to drop in my work into the website and then I should be ready to upload it after a few finishing touches.
:/. I told you I had to put that on hold, because I don't have the supplies or tools to finish the Tin Man.. The Scarecrow is finished, and the Cowardly Lion is nearly finished-- I only need to finish his paws, but the Tin Woodsman isn't a possibility at the moment.
Sounded like a lot of judgement to me.
Now.. Until September.
Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Thank you.
Oh, it's just the words you chose to say: "Is that still a thing?" just sounded judgemental.. And I didn't forget. It's all in here *points to head*. As well as on my to do list.
In that particular instance? I don't know.. I am definitely actively thinking about it.
I definitely think about it a majority of the day.. But probably not as much as you think I do or want me to.. So I'll go feel bad somewhere else.
Not a pity party, you're just making me feel bad.
You and my father have opposing views on the subject.
No, he just expects me to work for him, because he assumes that I'm not seeking a job.
So whenever I'm working on a project or my website, he pulls me away to do work for him.
Okay.
He sees me on my computer and assumes I'm not working, but most of my work is on the computer.
A few hours per day, but I do quite a bit around the house-- and I've been spending time with friends.. I spent a good chunk of my day yesterday though.
Okay.. I'll let you get to sleep now.
Let me do that now.
Okay. I might need to do this in the morning. Is that okay?
Okay. I'm sorry it can't be now.
Goodnight.
I love you too.. How much do you need right away?. I know I'll need to send you more, of course.
Okay.. I'm sorry :/. It's not fine.
Okay, thank you.. You don't have to call the rest a gift though, I'll just need more time to get it to you.
I want to be able to contribute.. Instead of adding everything, could it be a spreadsheet?. I think that's what you do normally, but I want to check.
Everything you can include, include it.
We can, if you wish.
I'll be there or be square.
Rawr to you!
You've got this!
Don't thank me. It's all of your skill coming to play.
Have fun playing guitar.
That's okay.. Some other time.
Me too..
A skype call?
I'm alright.. I've been working on my website.. How are you?
What have you been up to?
Sounds like fun!. I've been trying to keep up with my exercising.
Mhmm.
Oh, I thought we would be talking.. Did you still want to?
I'm fine just "chilling" if you had activities you wanted to do.
Yes, I'm om nomming at the moment.
Not during om noms!. :P
Wow, those first three!. Okay, I did.
Sure thing.
Okay.. Good morning, Sunshine!
^~^
You're so cute!
Ahhh!. You!. !!1. Have a great day at work today!
Wow! Cool!. I'll be doing lawn work.. For part of the day. And I'm hoping to finisb the website.. Finish*
Silly big thumbs.. Thanks!. I'm back from lawn work!
It's rainy, which counter acts the heat.
Mhmm!. It's nice n' humid now though!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.!. Hello, you!. I miss you!
!!! you!. How was your day?
Aren't you going to bed?. I'm ready, but I don't want to take sleep away from you!
Sure I can do that!. Looking good!. https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LjjEw9adIUA/maxresdefault.jpg. :3. I feel all warm and cuddly!. I'll save the cuddles for when I see you next.
Hug. Good morning!
(:. Go get your day!
Thank you! ^~^
Wow!?. I don't know what I'm looking at, but cool!. Oh-- is it a recruitment process?
That's exciting!
Cool!. That's awesome.. Super happy for you!. I love you.. I suppose it was a bit early for celebration.. But I know you.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I'm sorry about this morning. I had alarms set, but I slept through them.. I don't know why, but I've had this terrible feeling come over me.
I don't know.. Just a weird feeling.. Internal ones.. But how are you?
Cool. How was that?
It was okay.. I mowed a few lawns and I saw Gap and Bowen for a short while.. I've mostly been digital painting though.
I'm painting Cody and his friends for his youtube channel.. It's been fine.
That's what I have so far.
Well thanks-- it's from his expressive face of his.
Awesome!. Time to get cuddly,. Gotta tuck you in.. Sorry if that sounds weird.
Just an odd feeling of sadness-- I don't know why... I'm glad you had a nice day today. I hope you have another tomorrow! Goodnight and sweet dreams.
No-- It was just an explainable feelings that came over me.
I really don't know.. It just happened for some reason.
I don't think that's it.. But maybe...
None. I don't mean to worry you.
I don't think that's strange.. Feelings aren't something you can control, and if you say that you can, you're probably lying.
(not you in particular, but in general)
But that doesn't seem like "real" emotion.. Real emotion occurs as the cause of the emotion occurs. Any other time, and you're either forcing yourself or acting.
But the way we feel is different.
We have control how we react to something, but the emotion may still be there.
I was spending some time with Gap, and I walked home, and I had an overwhelming sense of sadness.. Then I wanted to talk to you, but you weren't available, and now I can't explain it.. Not to put any sort of deflection or blame upon you.. Because I know that I can't talk to you whenever I like.. And that's okay.
Nothing out of the ordinary. I guess I felt kind of bad that he was downtown, but didn't invite me to hang out with him.. But that's okay.
Anyway-- I know you've got to get up early in the morning.. Nice artsy photo.
I wanted to take photos of you like that.
The one you were just tagged in.
Yes.
I think I was also feeling a bit of jealousy, because a lot of your friends are guys.. But that's silly of me.
I suppose so.
I guess it's that you're doing romantic things with them, and I feel like I'm either missing out, or that you'll fall for one of them.. You know.. silly stuff.
You don't have to be looking to fall for someone.
Yeah, but you've been having your doubts.. So it's not out of the realm of possibility.
I don't know why the feeling came up.
Okay.. Goodnight then.
*tuck* *tuck*. *forehead kiss*. Sleep tight.. Unless that's uncalled for.... Maybe you're not ready for that.. When are you going to Virginia Beach?
Okay. That's what I thought.. Thanks.. You can call me in the morning, if you like.. Good morning.
Didn't want to miss out like before.
You.. But I guess I did anyway.
Sleep :P
I'm awake for real now though.. I can exercise with you, if you want.
Okay. I'll be here.
You keep reading to your hearts content.
You can't! The story must continue.
Okay.. Video games seem like more fun when I'm not around.
Alright, well. I hope you have a great time.. I should be spending my time looking for a job anyway.
I'm ready to join you.. But I don't have to.. You'd likely do better without me.. I plan to make a cheesecake for you and your family. Sort of a way to make up for a cakeless birthday your mother had.. I was hoping you could take it with you after you visit Pennsylvania.. It should last 6-8 days if refridgerated, and several months if frozen.. I was going to leave it as a surprise, but I also wanted to make sure it would be a wanted surprise.
I can make his favorite cake too.
Oh... Changed your mind?
It just makes me feel sad. And that you don't want to see me again.. I wish it motivated me though.
Okay.. I assume your exercises are over. Have a nice day.
Do you know your brothers favorite cake?
Does he like Cheesecake?
Well you should hint at it with him.
Yes. Hint like: "What's your favorite cake, brother?"
I'm joking like a silly person.
It's because the hint is straight forward.. So much, that it's not a hint.. You could just talk dessert and what his favorite flavor is.
Okay.
Oh wow!. I've never made that before! :o
Okay :P. I can still make the cheesecake though.

I assume you don't like that one.. But okay. I'll try.. It took me a while to figure out, but the scrolling on my animation page looks pretty great :P. Goodnight, Leandra.. I hope you're safe.. How was your day?
Sure.. Or video chat first.. :P. Or not. That's okay.. Just being silly.. Good morning!. I had a nice time with you.
It was nice all the same.. Any ideas on a studio name?. I can help with a logo, if that helps.
Okay. I was just offering.. I was thinking you could make a reference to a video game with the name of the studio.. But I'm still trying to think of something.
I keep getting a feeling that you don't want me around.. I'm not sure why.
I gave you what I had, pad wise. I may have shin guards. I'll look wheb I get home.. When*. Big thumbs, always in the way.. As for a helmet, I was never one to own a skateboard, so I never owned a helmet. I can look at the thrift store though. (I will clean it, of course)
Okay, I can do background checks.. I will let you know what I find. Would you like a partner to practice with?
You should definitely get the best one for yourself.. I will figure one out for myself.
I know.. Just get the best one though.. Unless there's some other confusion?
Were you suggesting the backup for me?. Is it important to get the skateboard right away?
I see.. Well I have a few ideas so far.. I'll try to find a helmet for you. I'll let you know if I find anything, otherwise you can get your other choice.
About the skateboard.
About getting one for myself. For you too, if you're a bit patient.
Mostly some ideas on the deck design.
A skateboard looks easy enough to make...
I was hesitant to say that, because you wouldn't approve.
Why wouldn't you use it?
Hardware has to be replaced anyway.
Okay.
It's just layers of veneer glued together and shaped with a mold.
It might take an afternoon. A few hours?
Multiple boards could be made.. Supposedly.
It should do tricks as long as the board is shaped properly.. High quality veneer should make the skateboard what you need.. The rest is hardware.
But that may not be a quality board to begin with.
I suppose. I will do a bit more research and let you know. Scott has some of the materials already.
Okay.
I like cakes, so don't worry about that.. Making your mother a cake is the least I can do for her.. And it only takes 30 minutes of prep.. That's a great picture of you.
You look so great!
Looks surreal, which may be a good thing!. So I think it's great :)
Oh! Rabbits too!. The lighting could be adjusted a bit on that one.. But it looks good too!
Best part= 2:13. I guess it's from 2:10-2:15!
My favorite part out of the whole video.
Of course.. You sent it to me, so I watched it (:. That's how things work :P. (Not really, I'm actually glad you sent it, because I was looking forward to seeing your ice skating abilities from when you first told me about it). (and by "not really" I mean-- that's not really how things work). (I was interested in watching it, regardless of whether you sent it or if I found it myself). I think this would have been a great profile picture too.
It was a cute goat.
Or a derp goat.. I want a cute profile picture too. :P
I should have all of the photos from Japan.. Thanks though.
Thank you.. I liked it because it has a fox and a baby fox.. I'm there too, which is nice.
You're the fox.
That's part of it!. The other part is that I think you're cute and I like you.
If you don't want to visit me in Pennsylvania, we can likely deliver the cheesecake to you in DC.
I suppose I could give it to your mother before she leaves then.. I left my external hard drive with you, correct?. I've found that my operating system is too old for Adobe to continue updating, so I need to make a back up of my computer and then reluctantly download El Capitan.. Anyway... I was wanting to confirm that it was either with you or at your house and whether I could get it back.
It was before I left to go to Massanutten. I put the photos from Japan on it and left it with you so you could download them-- but the hard drive wasn't PC compatible, so I uploaded the images on Google Drive.
Well I was packing that day until around 10, but I wanted to come visit you before I left for Harrisonburg.. Then I came over, we ate breakfast together, I gave you the hard drive.. Sorry... I was trying really hard to remember what all we did.. I'll be sure to call your mother before I come over to pick it up though.. Oh no.. I accidentally clicked "Join Archery Club at VT" and they accepted me.
Oh goodness.. I remember your mom made something with cheese.. And it was very tasty.. By cheese-- I think it was cream cheese.. I assume you remember, and you're just checking if I do too.. Your mom makes some sort of egg dish with cream cheese and mushrooms-- I think that's what we had for breakfast.. As well as oatmeal.
Yeah.. Anyway. It's gotten fairly late-- so I will say goodnight.. Sleep well.. I'm going to leave for a while. I am feeling unwanted, so I'll see you around.
Goodnight.
I suppose I was hoping for a different response, but it's at least what I expected.
I was hoping you'd be more excited to hear from me.. But I give you no reason to be excited, other than just being myself, I suppose.
I'm sorry.. I haven't felt like you've been all that interested in talking to me, so I left.
I was trying to gauge how much being way would affect you and whether you would miss me. I was also trying to see how well I could go through a day without communicating with you and to see how that would affect me.. being away*. So far I see that you were fine without me, but that I can't go the whole day, though I was close.
That could jeopardize the test results.. For you to know could make you react a certain way.. I suppose I can continue with the experiment though. It won't be any different than it has been.. Have a nice time at work though. I hope you have a nice day.
You shouldn't come if you were coming only because I applied to jobs.
I don't need a reward for applying.
I'm working on it.
I have more to worry about now than when I had school-- school was my only priority.. My deadlines are not my only priority.. Building the website has taken longer than I expected-- but I want it to be functional and well thought out.
It is, but I can't help if I can't work on it.
It's my highest priority, but it's not my dads.. So if he expects something of me, then I can no longer devote time to it.. But you probably find this as another excuse not to work on it.
Just feeling bad.. But I'm still working on things.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I spent some time with Molly, and my website is nearly complete.
So I will be making my applications tomorrow.
That's the plan. I spent a lot of time making sure my images would be web safe.. This makes them uniform and easy to display.. It also keeps everything I need in a convenient place.. (I'm justifying why I would spend the amount of time I did). (and when I say I spent a lot of time, I exaggerate a bit)
Do you still want to talk to me?
I meant in general.. But goodnight.
http://www.petermattox.com/
There's still a bit left, but I think it's at a place where I can send it out to companies.
Oh no.. really?
Thanks. I've run into a problem applying to jobs-- employers want past employers, which I don't have.
https://nickelodeonanimation-viacom.icims.com/jobs/4605/storyboard-artist/candidate?from=login&back=intro&hashed=-435712829
Yes.
Resume is one of the first things to include.
I was thinking "N/A" as well.
Okay.. Thanks.
Probably not.
I'm not sure how to do that.
I asked one thing and you assume I don't google.
I changed my "about me" which is more "personal" but that doesn't mean you will like it.
I suppose there's room for it-- but I don't know how to incorporate it well.
Okay-- I added the skills and website.
Anyway-- I haven't officially applied to a job yet, so I suppose I won't be seeing you this weekend.. I added my face to the contact page.. As per your suggestion.. I'm going to be applying tonight and tomorrow-- but you told me to let you know whether you should come by today, so I missed my deadline.
Thanks?. I'm going to apply to Gropen in Charlottesville.. There are more-- but that one seems like a good job.
Yeah-- it's an email application, so I'll have to figure that out.. I just finished my application to Nickelodeon to work as a storyboard artist on the show Harvey Beaks.. And for Spongebob Squarepants.. I don't have the necessary character expressions, but I applied to them.
That's not good.
I don't want the trip to be inconvenient.
I think 10am
Sure. What is it?
If Charlottesville isn't too much out of the way, we could pick them up if there is someone there. I may also have another set.. Also, Scott knows how to fix the power steering belt... that doesn't help, but I think a part can be found nearby.
I think Agees sells Nissan parts.. That may not be it's name though.
I will discuss the possibilities.
Okay. Goodnight.. Sleep well.
Good morning.. Have a nice day at work.. I don't know why I keep having this feeling, but I feel like you've been distant.
I don't know.. We're just not talking much, which was happening before I was "experimenting". I feel like you're forgetting about me. Soon I won't be in your life.
Then I feel neglected.. It's probably something wrong with me though.
Don't worry about it.
How was your day?. I haven't heard from you in a while... How was your general week?. Anything exciting?
I haven't done much other than work on the illustration for Cody, make my website, and apply for jobs.. I forgot to ask your mother about the elbow pads and knee pads.. I will pick them up for you though.
I'm further along.. I've got more of his friends to add though.. But it's good.. Anyway. You've got more interesting things to do, so I will let you get to it.. If you were going to have your mother bring the elbow pads/knee pads to Virginia Beach for you, then I do not need to pick them up. Especially if the likelihood of you coming to Pennsylvania may be slim.. Though, I could drive separately and pick you up.. But I understand if you don't want to go.
Are you sure?. Because I know that circumstances are difficult right now and I don't think you should have to go through the trouble of catching a bus.
Well that's good.. If you cannot, then I will understand.
That was fast.
Is there a chance that it could break again? Are you sure you want to drive on it so immediately after the repair?
Okay.. I'll trust your judgement.. I looked into building a skateboard. I could definitely make one for $40-50.
Bushings are part of the truck unit.. It's three or so main parts.. It might be useful to be able to make replacement decks if you break yours.
Okay.. I'll keep thinking about it.. I don't doubt my abilities to make it though.. Even on the first try.... I want to hear/see you say something.... But these things can't be forced.
Be safe.. Do you have a helmet?. I hope so... It's pretty important.
You should bring your skateboard to Pennsylvania.
I can do that. I need to get the pads from your mother, but she hasn't yet responded to my text.. http://www.regmovies.com/Movies/Summer-Movie-Express?sf11708847=1
With you?. None of the particular movies on that list.
I can't tell when the schedule began.
But it was posted recently, so I'm assuming it is currently going on.
Oh. I see.. Okay. The movie I wanted to see played a long time ago.. That cleared it up then.. I suppose I wouldn't have been able to see anything with you either way.
I can't watch it in theaters.. 176 E. Hershey Park Drive.. How was skateboarding?. Also, blank boards are fairly inexpensive.
I have the pads.. I will look for a helmet.. Is there anything else you need?
Your mother actually brought them to me, though I wanted to pick them up.
Sorry to disappoint.
It's a resort, so I would assume so.. Let me check to confirm.
Okay, that's good.
It has an outdoor heated pool.
I read outdoor.. :P. Hopefully we can find a place for you to skate.. Goodnight.. Sleep well.. I miss those video chats we had.
Yes,. Yes.*
No worries.. I mean-- nothing to worry about.. Are you sure there isn't anything you would like for me to bring you?
Okay.. I've noticed you haven't said "I love you" in a bit and I understand you wouldn't say it unless you meant it, so I've been worried.
That you no longer love me.
You may only say so because I brought it up.. I kept getting the idea that you wanted to see me in person to give me the bad news.
Could you give me some examples?. We don't have to talk about them, but you could let me think about them.. It can wait... Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Good morning.
I can't wait to see you!. I love you.
Have a great day today, Cutie!
That's so nice of yoi!. You*
That's okay!. You're all we need.. When could we expect you?
Awesome! Can't wait!. I can save some food for you when we get dinner!. Don't forget your work laptop.
Be safe!. I like tacos!. So that's really cool that you're having tacos!
You don't have to do that for me.
It's a nice gesture, and I would love a taco, but you should eat it if you're hungry.. If it's extra, then yes!
I don't want to take your taco if you are hungry.
I read it, but that doesn't mean you won't be hungry by saving one.. I understand that you've considered it, but you could still be hungry later on... Even if you promise to save the taco, you can eat it if you get hungry.
Things happen though.. I wouldn't want to, but they may feel bad if I don't.
Not accepting means that I did the favor because I wanted to, not because I thought I would get something out of itm. It*
No.. I don't understand why you're analyzing me.
Ah.. Would the person giving the gift be more prideful?
Because they may be trying to prove something?
Okay.. I don't see it.
I don't know where to park until we get there. It's interesting, and it makes sense.. Be safe. We're almost there, so I'll find out where to park soon.. The building has parking, and I have your parking pass.. Parking is in front of the clubhouse.. (By the pool). There's an outlet mall nearby, where we will likely have dinner. You could meet us there and drive back to the hotel with us.. It's across the street.
Okay! We will still likely be there :P. Don't text and drive! I love you!
Tanger Outlet Hershey.. We will actually be going to Chipotle for dinner.
Sorry! We're at Friendly's!. The group is indecisive.
We're eating, so I think you should come meet us here.
It could be hot?. You can read here.. And be with me here.
I have the parking pass though.
You need a pass to park there.
You can tell the lady at the desk though, she knows your car is supposed to be there.. So she'll be able to tell you whether or not you can stay inside.. You'll likely be fine.. I did want you here, of course, but enjoy your time.. They should have your name too.. You might be able to get a key. We're room 1202.. You could go swimming.
Parking might be your only issue.. But I think you'll be fine.
I did. You're fine though.
I figured.. I hope everything works out.. They probably can't give you a parking pass, but if they can, we could return the one we have.. Let me know if you can get in the room.. My dad's nearby if they need to talk to him.
Okay.. That's cheaper than the discount at the Giant, which is $47.80.. Do you want to go for two days? Or just one?. Sunday probably won't work, so one is fine.
I'm down.. The more the merrier-go-round.. We're on our way back.. As soon as you left it started raining!. I hope you're staying safe, cutie!. I love you!
Yay!
Oh, I didn't hear you say anything. But I'm quiet because other people are trying to sleep.
I just wanted to sleep next to you, like before. That's why you told me to call earlier. Did you forget?. Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!. I would have chatted more, but I don't have a room to myself.. And water is good! Gotta stay hydrated.
I understand! People just fell asleep though!. We can talk more tomorrow. I'm really glad you're safe!
I want to hear of anything interesting that happened on your car ride!. And at work too.. Did you make sure to put the cake in the freezer?. Oh! And how was the Hound of the Baskervilles?. (so far)
Goodnight, Cutie!
Good morning!
You got it to work?. You defeated the proxy???. Or is it that the url is crazy? I'm not sure what to make of it?
Oh! I tried to reach it, but I couldn't!
I figured that's why I couldn't :P. But that's really cool? Did you get the rubber ducky?
You're head is pretty great!
Leandra Bear. Polar Bear. I'm stuck in bear themes :P Code-iak Bear
Hmm... that's a tough one.. Any key words you could suggest?. Polaris, because it's a bright idea.
Oh!. I'll try to think of something more unique.. Is there anything that relates to the product?. What are more details about it?
This is random, but I mentioned that Eris is the goddess of chaos, and I was confirming with you that she is.. I'm looking for things that relate to application health and I thought to check various dieties. I don't like the idea now, but it reminded me.. The name could be as simple as "App Monitor"
Ah, that makes sense. I'm not sure if how you defined him makes sense though.
I think you said it was something bad.
I guess I can understand that. Anyway, I didn't mean to drag the subject on. I'm focusing on diagnosing the lack of name for your app diagnostics.. (That was purposely wordy)
It could be "App Scan"?
That's because it's a good name :P. Pulsar. I might keep saying astrology terms until one sticks.
Why not?. Ursus maritimus is the proper name for polar bears.. I can make you the logo.
That one isn't good enough :P. Send the link to the hairbrush. Is it the one that's a three pack for $7.68?
Oh! That kind of brush!. http://m.ebay.com/itm/Conair-Translucent-Hair-Brush-3-Count-Detangle-Women-Comb-Three-Pack-Beauty-/262253343682?hash=item3d0f8473c2%3Ag%3AjC4AAOSwqYBWoY2b&_trkparms=pageci%253Aa49130da-52ac-11e6-8f1d-0050568f419c%257Cparentrq%253A23e7dc531560a787f7a4be76fffcfef5%257Ciid%253A4. This is what I was looking at.
What about both?. Are you sure about Polaris?. I can use the polar bear logo I have if I can find it!
You can always lose the new handle.
What would you like?
I had this as an idea
Oops!. I forgot facebook converts pngs into jpegs.. I sent them via email.. I'm excited to hear about the escape room!. I sent you the one from the movie poster as well-- in case you're not a fan.. Everyone says hello back!. Sorry to think you were sad. I suppose I was listening to your voice wrong.. I can't wait to see you next!. (:. Wow.. I miss you already!
But I'm not with you.. I'll be spending more time on job applications.. Can I be your rubber duck?. How are the logos? I sent them to your Virginia email.
Okay! I hope you like them. Good luck on preparing for tomorrow!
You can use either. If there is anything you want me to change, let me know!. If you need anything else, just let me know!. *squeek*. Oops! That's just my *squeek* rubber duck coming out.
Of course! Any time you need me!
Yeah, I should be.. What do you have in store?
Sounds great!. I should have remembered.
Yeah. We can take the buick. That way I can drive the way back and you can rest.. And I'll drop you off at your class.
That sounds awesome!. Are there other details to smooth out? I can do that while you work tonight! Or if you're going to sleep!!. Tomorrow's a big day, from what I hear.
I meant for traveling in general!. But that can likely wait for a few days.. Are you going to sleep after airbnb?. Goodnight and sweet dreams if so!.. I'm going to work on my conversation skills, and I'll try to practice tomorrow with you.. I love you!
I think I signed up through facebook, but I receive messages through pmattox2@radford.edu
Unless it is petermattox@ymail.com. I was sure it was the other, but I think I was wrong.. I apologize! It's not too difficult to switch the email, I've done it before.
It appears that I would have to change my email settings.
Sweet dreams to you, Cutie!. It says your online-- I really hope you're sleeping!
Good morning!. I was too late to help?. Nooo!!!. Did you make the UVa/VT logo?
Wow!. That's really cool!!!. http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-Conair-Professional-Salon-Results-Oval-Hair-Brush-Every-Day-Brushing-CHOOSE-/162022732279?var=&hash=item25b94eb1f7:m:muX2PAwTfUNhVAQQNjxMwaw. Random me :P. I think the handle on the brush may be removable.
Oh, is there one you would prefer?. I don't know the brand you currently have, but I remember it was about 2.5in x 4in. Or so.
Is it a brand you're partial to? Or will anything similar work?. Give me the details, and I can spend a reasonable amount of time looking for it!
What are the dimensions?
Okay
Interesting! It looks about what I estimated before.. We're not leaving until 7 or so.. The tickets allow us entry the night before and then the whole day after.
Yes! They were cheaper too!
$39
I think by 5pm, but we're going later anyway.
Thanks! I went to the pool with my dad!. I miss you too!!!!
The hot tub was in the middle of the pool, so my dad was in it, while I was swimming.. No, we just walked around. The pool was really shallow.. Oh, there was cornhole. We played a bit, but I lost.. Hehe, we forgot our key, so we were stuck outside :P. But there's a phone that we used to call the room, and Paige saved us.
Yes please!. We can be the all star champions!. But I enjoy just playing with you, so it's okay if we don't get any better.. We just finished a movie together. It's called The Physician.. I came in about half way through though.
It's about a Christian who wants to learn medicine in 11th century Persia by disguising himself as a Jew.. The schools teaching medicine taught only Muslims and Jews.. I don't want to spoil more of the plot. It's based off of a book too.. I've been trying to keep you updated. What have you been up to? How did the meetings go?
Interesting!. How goes the project? Any more stumbling points? Be safe returning home.
I wish I could be your rubber duck tonight, but maybe you can talk to a picture of me.
Neat! (:. Just talk it out and you'll figure it out in no time!
It always seems to work for you (:. Good luck! I love you!!!
Thank you! I'm the odd person out, so I don't have a roller coaster buddy.
The lonely rider who is consoled by moving ahead in line to fit an unwanted seat.
Yes :p
I'm not that worried.
I love you too!!!!. You're so great!. Sweet dreams to you!. I had a nice time at the park. We rode Storm Runner, Sidewinder, Great Bear, Skyrush, and Sooperdooperlooper!. Goodnight and sleep tight!. Tomorrow will be a park day extravaganza.. Good morning!!. Have a great day today!. (Hug). I miss you. What are you up to today?. Solve any more problems?. We've stopped for a food break, so I'm all yours.. I was all yours before, but I might have been scarce.. I guess you're busy though. Good luck with everything!
I am. It's not the same without you, but I'm having fun.
It cooled down a little bit. I think it was a bit more tolerable.. I'm excited to be with you!. I love you!
We went to the pool after the park, I practiced my breathing! I just got back. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I love you so much!. I want to hear about your day, but I know it's late and that you have work in the morning.
(hug). Sweet dreams, Cutie Leandra Pie!. I looked cute in a fanny pack today.
:P. Sleep tight!. *tuck* *tuck*
Good morning!. I just got back from the pool.
I love you too!!!!. It will be tax free weekend starting tomorrow!
I think in stores... let me check the rules!. If the company is based in Virginia, then it will be tax free.. Online or in store*. So maybe I can get you something?
That might sound random to you, but it's been something I've been struggling with since this morning.. Anyway... back to relevance, would you like something during this tax free occasion?
It's a thing.. Well not really...
It won't be, that's why I asked if you want me to get you anything.
But will it be tax free? :P
It's up to you. I'll be here anyway with my family.
We're at the Tanger Outlet. Pennsylvania doesn't have sales tax on clothes.. But tax free weekend starts tomorrow in Virginia.
And I think Pennsylvania, but on other things.. Thanks! I spent it swimming and playing a few board games.. And packing, of course.. I can get you knee/elbow pads and a helmet, if you haven't yet.
I did not.
Really? I would have rather gone with you.. But I'm content not going.
Maybe we can come back some time.
Oh. Okay.... Well I don't think I'll be able to go.
Today's our last day.
We're going to eat dinner after everyone finishes with their shopping.
I wouldn't want to go alone, and I think you would make it a more enjoyable experience.
You're the only Kiss flavor I want to sample.
I saw the hours.. I'll bring it up.. I wonder if I could smuggle kisses for you.. I could try to sneak them out.. They might have chocolate detectors though.
They might send me to chocolate jail.. I hear the bars are made of chocolate.. My dad will not allow it.
Is that a lesson to 3d animation?. for*. That looks awesome!!!
That's cool! Thanks for sharing it with me!
Oh, my dad was considering Chocolate World, but the consensus was no.
I think better, but they haven't been watching it as often as I may have led you to believe.
We can check out Apples to Apples from the business center.. Molly and Ana wanted to play.. And I'm sure more do, but they brought it up.
I love you. How was your day?. The fish sandwich before was a Haddock, something reminded me, and by something, I mean the same sandwich.
We're actually at a diner called The Soda Jerk.. Have you been conversing with a duck??. What's your favorite soup?. Did you get your hand on cannoli yet??
But I can be your duck!
Ookay...!!. I like having you as my phone wallpaper.
You're a very beautiful young lady.
It makes me smile whenever I look at my phone ^~^. So thank you!
You're so so so cute!. :3. Thank you for keeping me in your life.
I do what I can!. I can't wait to see you next.. Until I see you again*. We went to the Chocolate World!. They were convinced!!. Anyway.. goodnight and sweet chocolate dreams!
The chocolate bar was small, but the tour was kind of cute.. I couldn't find the exclusive kisses though. Maybe you could help me with those?. That was a silly joke... The overall consensus was that the tour was a nice conclusion to our trip!
(hug)
Goodnight.. Sleep well.. Have a great day at work tomorrow.
I hope what you're doing now has been fun.
What have you been doing?
Oh... no.... I should.
Sweet dreams to you.. Good luck with deleting files! I know how long that can take.. Good morning!. How'd that moon get there??. I only pressed the evil sunrise!
That sneaky moon! It must want me back sleeping, but I won't give it the satisfaction!
I love you too!!!. This donut store is cute.. All of the donuts were baked donuts!
You know of it??. I thought it was cute, so I sent it to you, but you already knew of the cute!
Wow!. That's cool!
I thought that would make you happy!. We were doing a quick tour of Gettysburg, and there were a few horses.
It was pretty neat!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. We're almost in Blacksburg.. Officially back in Blacksburg.. So I'm safe, if you were wondering.. I hope you had a great day today. Sleep well!
I love you too!. If she needs a ride in the future, just have her let me know.
Thanks!. I'm going to do my best.
I love you too!!!!!!!!1
I know!. I hope that's fun!!!
Did the cheesecake travel well?. Oh! That's good!
Oh, okay! I hope it works. The topping isn't all that difficult to make though.. I will let  you enjoy the beach!
I like your company as well!!. I'm looking at jobs, but I'm about to take a break and work on the illustration for Cody.
It's good. I'm about to work on some of his friends, and his girlfriend, Renee.
No, he just wants her there :P. He does mention her quite a bit though.
Me too!. I'm excited that he might be visiting soon.
He said he would try to visit before school starts.. So it's not a definitive date as of yet.
Or the 14th!
I'll be sure to! He hasn't said anything on facebook for a while though.. But he's a busy guy!
I hope you do too, Leandra!. Have a great time with your family!
Say "Happy Birthday" to your brother for me.
Thanks!. Enjoy the beach too!. Art!. That looks like a great image depicting the beach!
I like the contemplation of the man in the red shorts.. "Should I go in the water? Maybe I shouldn't.."
I've been doing a better job of going into cold water!. I went from the hot tub and right into the pool many times!. :P
So you can count on me to get cold with you.
Okay!. I'm ready.
Okay!!!. I've been waiting for this moment :P
Is that a problem you've been experiencing?
Okay! I'm free the 6th-14th
Great!. Then we can go swimming afterwards.
You won't be swimming at the beach? :P. Will you just be showing off your new bathing suit?
That makes sense!
I might.. I definitely have those sleds that could act as boogie boards.. :P
My dad would have a better idea than I would-- so I will ask him when he gets home, but they are just waterproof foam, so they shouldn't cost all that much.
That sounds like a fun place to stay.. Though I'm imagining slides and swing sets.
Maybe outside then?
That's true. It's like owning a boat.. It's a money pit.
I would like it to have an office that has a bunch of paper strewn across it for a project I would be working on.. And it would have many art supplies.. The rest of the house could be anything. It could have some skates, boogie boards, and other fun stuff.
Maybe :P. I hope your day was really great!. Do you plan on being in Blacksburg on the 13th and 14th?. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Oh, good!. I was just checking!. Thank you, goodnight!
Good morning!. Gap invited me to a Kings Dominion and Virginia Beach trip!. So I'm on my way there.. (Hug)
Thanks!
I wish you could be there!. I'll be there while you're gone!. And that's no fun.
No way!. Or... maybe for you.... Have a safe trip back to DC!
And Bowen and Cassidy.. I love you, Leandra!. How is your family?
Just okay?
I can help top, if you like.. Just put me to work.
Yes, definitely.. I've really been looking forward to it.
Awesome!!!. I made sure to bring my laptop, so I'll be working on applications this week.
I'll be in Virginia Beach until Wednesday.
We might go to Misako's!
No, it happened all last night.
We're staying at a hotel by the beach!
I should have brought some!. I will, then we can use them.
I will try!. Did your mother reschedule her eye surgery?. I can give her a ride, if so.
*attacked*. *dead*
I wish I were there too!. We were rained out of the park, but it's been great!. How are you too?
Should I send them or deliver them myself?. I'm not sure how they will reach you through the post, so I'll bring them directly to you. You haven't said how you were yet!
I'm missing you too!!!. We're in a hotel now.
Okay!!!. Well... I'm sharing a bed, so maybe not.
Okay!!! :3 I can't wait!. I'll work on my core so that I can catch you better.
Eep!. Sweet dreams, Cutie Pie!!!!1 I'm nomming on a fruit bowl.
Good morning!!! Have a great day at work!
The beach was nice!
The water wasn't very cold!
We walked a few miles, splashed a bit in the water, and swam a bit. We might go back.. We haven't picked up boogie boards yet.. Back tonight I mean.
We can do that when we go to the beach!. We're going to eat sushi.
The dinner buffet is only on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, but we would have!
Tomorrow is Tuesday :P
But that's okay! :3. The sushi here at Yukai Byuffe is pretty good!. There's a bowl of nothing but sashimi!!!!. Pho is included in the buffet!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I love you!!
It's a nice restaurant!. I miss you.. Sincerely,. Your Sillyhead
Keep doing that thing you do!. Sleep tight!. Good morning.
Have a great day today, Cutie.
Most likely!!. We had Thai food for "brunch". Gap approved of it too :P. I didn't see the weather until now. It's going to be storming the whole day.. It was clear this morning though.. I can't wait to see you.. It has stopped raining, so we will go until it gets dark.
It was fine, walked around in the rain :P. We just ate a seafood buffet. I had a lot of crab.
Mostly crab, but the blackened mahi was good!. How have you been?
Oh, definitely!
You've got this!. You'll have me as your rubber duck all next week!
Oh... Well... you can have me after hours then.
I'll wear a bill if you need me to.
I don't believe you're kidding!
We'll see!. Goodnight and sweet dreams. Sorry to distract you so often.
If you say so.... Sleep tight!
I hope everything goes well for you for the rest of the week!
You're up so late!. I really hope you're getting enough rest!. Is there anything I can help you with that could aid you in any way?. Anything at all?. I can do more to help next week too, especially since I'll be with you. (Unless I'm not allowed)
Yep!. Good morning!. I can help prepare meals for you, that might give you extra time too.. I can be your test audience too!
Anything you need.. I'll even brush your hair.
No, just an offer?. We have stopped at The Cheesecake Factory. It will be my first time.
Is that what you got?. I think I'm going to order the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake.. Oh. Add Caramel before Cheesecake.. I'm surprisingly not very excited.
I can't remember whether you said that the cheesecake I made for your mother was good or not.. How was it?
That's good.. Would you like a different type of cake for your birthday?. (Different than cheesecake)
Anything you want, and I'll make it as ordered.
I would like to make it for you.. And it's not a problem.
Yes.. I'm about an hour away.. Just went passed mile marker 180.
Thank you. Good luck with your work.. I'm safe in Blacksburg.. Goodnight and sleep well.. Good morning.. Have a great day!. Good luck with everything
Thanks
It's proceeding well. How is yours?
That's good.. What have you been up to?. Whatever it is, I hope it's going well.... Goodnight.. I want to call you and I want to talk to you.. Please excuse me.. I apologize.
I hope that's going well. I'm going to run some errands.. if you need anything from the grocery store/walmart, let me know, I can hook you up.
Any time.. Just say the word.
Goodnight for later.. Did you have anything in mind for when I go to the store?
Not yet.. I was going to go with Katy, so when she's ready to go.
You can go ahead and go to sleep.
Yes, but I'll be leaving now.
Thanks. Still at the store. Sure you don't want anything?. I can replace that umbrella of yours.. Unless it looked more like this one.. Are you coming to Steppin' Out tomorrow or Saturday? (Most likely Saturday?)
Oh, that's cool.. I hope you have a good time.. Molto mi piace vincerti in amore amico che di tutti sei migliore.. Have a safe trip to Steppin' Out.. I would like to see you, but I understand if you want to catch up with other friends.
When are you leaving for Steppin' Out? Or have you already?. You can ignore the Italian, it was just a silly thing.
"How it pleases me to win you in love, you my best friend." ~ Beatrice di Dia
Me neither.. Are you still planning on going to Steppin' Out?
I went through, but I didn't have anyone to go with.. I wrote the quote the way I found it.. Are you still planning on coming to Blacksburg?
But you're not going to Steppin' Out?. Did you want to see me?. I have something for you. May I give it to you?
You're free to get something to eat at my house.. I'm going to miss you.
I thought I was supposed to stay
I thought we were in the lobby.
Okay.
I love you too!. Good luck! I know you'll solve all of your problems, and you'll be able to go to sleep early tonight.. A table of food appeared and all I can do is stare :P. I'm joking-- it doesn't affect me that much, because I have snacks!. Did you want more?. I also have the Lara bar, if that convinces you to come visit me.. Good luck on everything.
I'm not a fan of beef jerky.. Thanks though.. You're a food fairy.. I don't have any means to access the internet other than through my phone.. I won't come bother you.. I don't even know where you are, either way.
Shouldn't you be leaving soon?
Did you leave?. We won whatever competition we were in.. Good luck on your presentation. I grabbed a good amount of food from the breakfast bar, I don't know what the pass wins.. I hope that I won't get too hungry.
Where is that?. Is it somewhere I can access without you?. I don't know where the auditorium is.. I can't go anywhere without you.. It's not something I can easily find on the internet, and I'm technicallh already supposed to be with you.. Technocally*. I want to go, but if I can't get there, and since you're already doing your presentation, you can't help me.. Never mind.. I didn't know the auditorium was part that open space we were in before.
I'm at the auditorium, so I've seen a few things.. How are things going?. Did you want to go skateboarding again today?
Maybe you should go home and take a nap.. I can be your alarm.
I can let you sleep for any amount of time you like.. And then I can spot you for when you skateboard.. And then when we get back you can practice guitar.. Then when you feel "rested" you can do more work.. But it's up to you.. Just a suggestion.... I'm not really supposed to wander without you.. I also don't remember which floor to go to.
I didn't see fish tacos.. I will have to live without fish tacos.. I found it without you though.. So no worries about my competence.. I need more attention, which isn't something you're able to give. I already know that you think thT what I just did was immature, but I'm just leaving for a while so that I can be physically alone, rather than feeling emotionally alone.
And that probably doesn't sound like a good excuse.. I'm just taking a walk.
When you would talk to me, you were always disappointed in me or my choices.
Jogging agaib.. Again*
I can't drive the car at all. It's decommissioned.. It hurts that I can't make a mistake.. I would have liked to see you, but I can't while the car is the way it is.. Which is also why I couldn't find the keysm. Keys*. I'm sorry for being so defensive.
Maybe tomorrow could be different.. (Todayl. )*
I would definitely like to see you.. Happy Birthday, Cutie Pie.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I can spot you. Did you get pads and a helmet?
You can use the other pads temporarily.. Or I can look for some.. Helmet is most important though.. Keeps your bucket on, as the skaters would say.
Yeah. Or is that the helmet?
Sounds about right.
Goodnight. I want you more.. Sorry... What did I just even send...
Nothing.
Yeah, my bad.. Did you want to do something for your birthday?
You also get food from Red Robins and Moes
Oh :0. Well that's okay then.. I will need a ride to do anything with you.. Unless I walk.. Oh, but here I go inviting myself.
I can help.
I would have to walk.. If that's okay with you.
Oh. I can wait until you have showered.
So you'll be busy all day? Well that makes sense. It is your Birthday, after all.. I've had a great time having you around for all these years, and I look forward to more years to come. Happy Birthday, Leandra. I hope your day will be exactly how you want it to be.
I had hoped to do something with you, but I'll find something else.. It is, did you want it to play with Twe?. Of course you do.. There are plenty of other games as well.
Where? I can still be your spotter.
Blacksburg High School has an old running track.. As well as a parking lot.. My church, though far away, will be clear of cars-- so that's a viable parking lot.. There's the skate park-- though you may not feel ready for that yet.
Yeah, we can do that.. We can do anything that you like.. I want to drop things off at goodwill with you.. But if there is anything else you would like to do, then I would like to participate.. Will you need anything else for when you visit Twe? Any baking supplies?
Any gamecube controllers?. I have bomberman
You know I do.
Okay. I'll assemble the package-- or at least, disassemble any unnecessary stuff.. You can get ready over here.. :P. Just kidding, but when you pick up the stuff, I can take your necklace off and put it back on again-- that way you'll be "ready."
Perfect.. I think Wong Park has a decent amount of "skate space" for you, by the way.. So if you want to get some skateboarding in, you can look no further than your back yard.
Oh, yeah, that would be a flat area.. You may. I'll be ready in 15 minutes. Would you like me to wear anything in particular? Tank top?
Any color preference?
Yes.
Are you really up for cannoli?
Because I think we can whip some up.. I wanted to make them before but I haven't gotten the chance yet.. But we can bake them, which will make them healthier.. I guess that was pretty misleading...
I got ready in 15 minutes
Don't forget your sub!
No???. :(. Whoa. WHOA!!!!!!!. whoa. That looks amazing!. A little much from me, huh?. I just get excited about food.
I want to see Kubo with you.. If only you were going to stay with me. :P. Goodnight.. I hope you had a nice time with Twe.. Sweet dreams!. I hope you had a great birthday.. I can wait to watch the movie, of course, but it would be nice to see you longer.
Awesome!. Be safe!!. Sleep tight.. I love you.
Awesome!
I would like to see you tomorrow :)
I'm still spending time with him!
Yeah, whenever you want to work on your room and skateboard.. We're walking around and chatting. Scott gave me a free xbox 360 slim. And we wanted to fix that.. It has a disk drive issue.
Thanks!
Of course. I think 8:30 should work for me.
Okay. I'll be there or be square.. Any clothing suggestions?
Sure!
Oops. I thought it was 8:30 or nothing :P
Oh, I'm awake.... !!
I'm definitely ready for exercise, but if we were going to a fancy restaurant, then I'd be kicked out and forced to live by a dumpster.. Because I haven't "put on my face" today.
Eep!
We've got a runner!. Go go go!!!!. Oh no, I'm going to be tackled!
Sweet dreams!!!!. I love you too!. Good morning!
Is it time to come over?
I thought it was 5:30, but I may be mistaken.
A little close?
I can be earlier.
Only gives us 3 hours of sleep.
Goodnight!. Going to bed now.
Kissy face back at ya.. Sleep well!!
Here
What's wrong?
Do you have things ready?
Okay!. At the porch, ready for the drop off.
Yes, you here?. You left your soup.
I love you too!. How will you remember me without soup?. Cody and I have arrived safely in Blacksburg.
Yay@. Is it fun?. I bet it is!. Have a great rest of your trip.. I trust you, but please be safe.. Where will you be sleeping?
I love you too!. Just be safe.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Hi, lovely.
It was okay. I was pretty tired though.. Speaking for tired, I want to double check on where to go in the morning.. Of*
No problem, I'm glad to help.
Wow!
Sure.
Okay.. I'll work on the tires.. 88x4?. I thought you were only getting 3
Okay.. I didn't forget about the spare needing repair.. I need to know where togepi is and what you want me to package it in.. Well... I can probably find both of those things.
That's where I would have checked first.. Is there anything else you need from me?. Should I ask for the tires to be manually installed?
It's good, because then you can change the tire yourself.. And I did have fun with Codym. Cody.*. I have the route ready.. I will ask about fixing the leaking spare and about wheel alignment.. Anything else you need?
When do you need it by?
I will do my best then!
I love you so much too!. So much so that I will share the free almond butter I received in the mail.
I had to pay shipping, but even then it was inexpensive almond butter!. And cutie pies get to share in it.
Awesome!. I would have told you about the deal, but I wanted to make sure it was okay first.
Redress the reese
Anything for you!
More like CutiePie9422!
Night night!!. Good morning!
Quality Tire received an 225 45ZR18 instead of ZR17. I will need to come back tomorrow to change the fourth tire.. received a*. How are you today?
Oh no!. I lost you.
Bye, Leandra.. I love you too!. Oops, I needed the other tire that was flat.. Your back left tire has loose bearings, so that needs to be fixed.. Just remembered tire was in the trunk though, so we should be fine.. We will be given a price for fixing the back wheel. You should stay by your phone so I can give you that information.. $69 to align the wheels. $159 for the alignment and the bearing.. (And labor). This is the smallest mailer I could find. I hope it looks okay. I think I will miss pick up by the time I drop it off though.
I found a lighter and smaller one.
Not much smaller, but definitely lighter.
I had a scale. I love you too!. Be safe!. Tah tah for now.
That's good.. How were the waves?. What will you do now that the sun is down? Go to nice restaurants?. It's not down yet, of course :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I'd like to hear about your day some time.. I miss you. Sleep well tonight.
That's good.
Met the parents then
Cool. I called just because I was missing you.. But I can wait. I know you're having a good time.
It's fine. Not a problem.
I guess because they already raised the car.. They would have had to lower it to get the wheel out of the trunk.. They made sure it was filled though, so it should make it back.. I'll let you get to sleep. I know you're busy.. And that you'll have a long day tomorrow.. I'm worried about you, but I'll try to think less about it.
My day was okay. I went to the shooting range with Gap, Cody, and Michael.. I shot a gun for the first time.. The rest of my day was errands and taking a nap.
I used an AK-47, a pistol, a mosin, and another gun Gap built.. I was pretty nervous, but it was neat.
Yeah, but it wasn't a whole lot.
I don't know. You've gone to a pretty romantic place...
Did you bring the goggles?
Oh, that makes sense.. That's good. Did you feel better after all of the swimming?. Will you participate in the 2020 Olympics?
You could compete in the skateboarding competitions too.. I can't wait to say that I know an Olympic Ostrich Racer.. Don't forget about the free drone.
I'm about to. Cody did it and said it was easy.. I love you too, Leandra Pie!. Or just Leandra, if you prefer.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Would you want me to deliver your car to Charlottesville?. Or have it serviced?. https://tryazuremarketplace.com/. I was unable to get Azure, so I will see if someone else in my family will want to sign up.. You need an Azure account or free trial.
I used mine at a hackathon already.. Though I didn't actually "use" it.. Good morning.. I got you 4 skateboard nuts.. They were at Heaveners.. 5/16th 24
No problem.. Time to take your car to the shop.. You never answered me when I asked if you would like me to deliver your car.
Would you like me to?
Yes.. I would go with someone else and they would drive me back.. Or I would find a ride back.. I wouldn't mind.. Your tire rods in the front are bad and should be replaced.. They can't do the wheel alignment, because once those are replaced it will need to be aligned again.. $226 without the alignment and $285 with.. The wheel bearing was $99 today.. And the wheels were $62.. I'll send you pictures of the receipts when I can.
They did not.
The rods would be $226 and then $285 with the alignment.. The wheel bearing is what holds the tire to the car.. Yours was loose, and if it wasn't replaced soon, you could have lost the wheel.. Which would have been awful on your car.
I didn't go ahead with an appointment for the tire rod, but he said he'd recommend getting it done soon.. You won't lose a wheel, but you will lose control of the wheel, which is really bad.. After it is fixed it is good to go for a wheel alignment. They did not do one this time, because after replacing the tire rod, you will need another tire alignment.
I took Cody with me :p
Yes you do. I got to keep the original front wheel, and the spare is in the trunk.
The spare wasn't repaired though-- the shop was busy.. But they said that it should be fine for when you would need it.
Anyway-- I wanted you to discuss the tire rod with your mother. She was going to check with Jackie.. And I know it's an extra $285.. I thought the wheel bearing was pretty crucial-- the man behind the counter even commented on it saying "I was worried you wouldn't be able to make it today."
You are fine.. If you are fine paying for the tire rods (both the left and right ones need to be replaced), then you should make another appointment.. Oh-- at Heaveners, I found some smaller washers and a nylon rod, which I think will fix the shoe rack.. Just another update on errands that needed to get done.. I hope the stop nuts will work-- they were the correct specifications but we will see. They weren't that expensive either way.. Sorry for the bombardment of text!. You still have yet to answer whether you want me to deliver your car.. :P
Okay.. Got it!. Is there anything else you need from me?. Is there anything that I'm forgetting?
Are you sure?. I'll be caught up after fixing the shoe rack?. If there is anything else you need, just let me know.
Is there anything you want from me then?. It can be anything :P
I can help look. I was spending time with Cody, so I'm going to reschedule.. I love you too! Good morning!. I have other things, but I can work it in my schedule.
I understand.. I can still help you.. Have a good day today.
We will not have access to a boat, so no sailing for us.. But it's Cody's last day, so I'm going to be spending time with him.
Oh!!!1. We may do that.. Quite the view, but I'd rather see you.
Sounds amazing. I wish I were there.
I bet!. I'm glad you're having a good time.
I'm excited to hear them.. When do you fly to Charlottesville?. I thought it would be Sunday or Monday.. Complementary hazelnut spread came with the almond butter!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
The chiropractor is open Monday-Friday and I told you that I would have to reschedule.. So I haven't gone yet.. My stay with Cody was really nice.. Good morning.
I hope you have a wonderful day today!
Sounds awesome!. I love you.. I guess you don't have to say it back.
I just fixed your mothers shoe rack. I hope it'll stay fixed!. I also left the stop nuts for your skateboard in your room by your cups and mirror.
I hope it holds up.. Have a nice flight.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. Don't miss an alarm if you go to bed!. I can try to give you a wake up call, if you like.
I'm sure you will. I just wanted to help you.. I hope you had a great trip. I hope you didn't forget about me, or fall in love while you were away.
Okay.. Good morning.
Have you landed?
How is thatM. ?*
Oh! Don't let me interrupt.
Okay. Don't miss your flight while you're out catching z's
I'm also awake.. and I'm fine. How are you?
It's coming for you!
I'm about to set up the new wifi router and then breakfast.. I need to write some cover letters, I know that I should have already, but I was spending a lot of time with Cody.
Cody left Saturday.
We filmed a youtube video together detailing the stuff he found on his trip.
No.. You shouldn't watch it either :p
Oh no...
I'll be embarrassed.
Oh I will... There's a job opening in Charlottesville to make illustrations for a bingo company.
No, but it's a job.
Tah tah for now.. I love you, Leandra.
Thanks! I really need to bunker down.. Did you want me to find your notebook and bring it to you?
Okay-- any in particular? Or would you like everything?. I can try scanning them. That might go faster.
If you can't find it, let me know-- I'll contact your mother and find/pick it up for you.
I'm about to mow the lawn, but I'll be free after that.. It shouldn't take me longer than 40 minutes.. I'll let you know if I finish sooner.
I had to mow the front lawn twice, which is why I'm late, but I'm here now.. If you need more time, I can shower and get presentable.. Or if you're ready now, then I can be too.
Okay. I'll be quick.. If you need more time, just let me know.
Yep.. I'm all ready.
Me too.. First you want to video chat, and now you don't feel like it.. Makes me feel a little bad, but I'll be fine.
I thought you would have.. I did send the request though.. I would have thought you would have wanted to talk more after so much time away.
I'm sorry.. It was hard to start after not talking for so long.. It felt like you didn't want to talk.. If you don't want to, I don't have to.
It's fine. Have a nice first week of classes.. Goodnight and sleep well.
Have a great day tomorrow.. Don't forget to get tucked in.
Good.. I was worried you wouldn't be able to sleep without doing so.
Good morning. I hope your first day goes well.
No problem. I know you'll do well.
Yes. Skateboard to class today?
Definitely. But I wouldn't doubt your talent.
New stop nuts for your trucks!. You've got a nice street to practice on.
You could even go around the circle if you wanted to.. Might be good way to practice turning.. I miss you. I'll try to be someone you can miss too.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Seems I have a tendency to bombard you with message walls.
Good thing you have 4 new ones waiting for you.
I could probably get you more, as a precaution.
Okay. Then whenever you visit you've got new axel nuts to use. In the mean time I suppose you can rely on soda tabs, as reliable as that sounds.
Who would have thunk it?. I'm glad you find it safe, then.. I hope you had a nice first day.
It was lackluster, but thanks.
I know.. I wish you were a bigger part of my day.. But I'll get by.. Are you tired of me?. Goodnight and sleep well!
I'm sure you're tired from your exciting day today then.. It just seems that you don't want to talk to me, but you're probably just busy.
You're not saying much.
Excuse me though.
I'm not sure of what you want.
If you want to talk, you're not saying much.
That's fine, I'd like to hear about Florida in person, and I'm not sure what else to talk about.. Good luck on your homework.
I can tuck you in later.
Yeah, when you go to sleep.
I can do a better job the next time I see you.. Would you like me to clean your room at all?. Take anything to the goodwill?
I just want your room to be nice for you for when you come back.
I know you can.. I just thought I could help so that you can sleep in your bed.. But you can do that yourself-- but I can help.. Then I can tuck you in and give you forehead kisses.
Sweet dreams.. I love you.
Did you get the drone?
I did the work for it, but I haven't received it yet. Cody has though!
It didn't take very long, I could do it for you.. Or you can have my drone when it arrives.
Goodnight!
Good morning.
I signed out, so that's strange.
Perhaps.
Probably-- the man had a thick accent.. So I probably just heard him wrong.
The man said it was the front two.
He did not give any.
I gave the receipt to my mother who will be giving it to your mother today at work.. I'm willing to help more.. Your mother already paid me for helping with things.. So you don't have to worry about it.
$352 for the tires, $99 for the bearing -$290 for what you already gave me.. Or do you mean for the tie rods?
That appears to be the total.
Surr. Sure*
We can use Venmo, I still owe you for the cake.
So you can deduct that from the total too.. Sounds good.
What do you mean?
If you need the money, then give me what you can.
Okay.
Through venmo?. Never mind. Thanks. Let me know when you need me to take the car again.
Sounds good.. Where to?
Okay, got it.. And you've got it!. Enjoy Rotunda Sing. Goodnight.
You don't seem to have much time for me, but I hope you had a nice day.. Sweet dreams.. That must have been really cool live. Thanks for thinking of me. Good Morning.
It was fine. How was yours?
I read some poetry, and watched some silly skateboarding videos among other things. What did you do?
Very interested.. Your day sounds great. I hope it's equally great today.
I will check it out.. Am I still your boyfriend?
Prepare for sass.... Okay, girlfriend.. (Snap). I was thinking I would pick up the car jack from Jackie's when I go Wednesday/Thursday.. Just to let you know.. I'm trying to register the wristband, but I need a citibank card to do so.. Or is that just for the bonus perks?
Okay, that makes sense.. Thanks. I'm all registered.
Easy peasy.. The drone, if you choose to acquire it, ships really quickly.. I would have mine right now, but Fedex delivered to the incorrect location.
I'm not sure. But Fedex is "fixing" it.. They would not say where it went though.. It was delivered to Blacksburg though.
Probably sleep.. You?
It was fine. Drove stickshift today. Made eggs and toast. Little things.. How about for yourself?
That was my whole day.
I watched a rom com. I wrote more to my screenplay. Made a few doodles. Tried to sort out the drone thing.. Nothing important.
Oh. It's important to me, but I don't relate it as something important to you.
I hope you sleep well too.. Goodnight. *tuck* *tuck*
I hope your homework goes well.. Have a great day tomorrow.
Good morning.. The drone is cool, but a bit difficult to fly.
No.. It's really small too :P
Yep.. And you can get your whole family to get one.. And then sell all but one :P. Just kidding (unless that's your plan)
The second one.
https://tryazuremarketplace.com/bitnami/lab. Yep.. It was very easy.. I bet the optional part of the lab could be useful.. You could do multiple labs, if you wanted to.
I think the tutorial laid the groundwork for sending (push) notifications.. It probably could host an app. You might need the $200 Azure credit to keep it running though.
Yeah.. Drone or Azure credit!. The choice is yours!
You take 5 screen shots of various parts of the lab and email it to them.. They will check if you did it correctly, and if you did, you'll get the credit or drone.. If you go for the drone, then this website will help you set it up: https://www.bitcraze.io/getting-started-with-the-crazyflie-2-0/
It shows you which ones to take at the end.. I guess if you knew which ones those were, you could take them as you went.
Yep.. You might even be fine using the ones I took.. I'm not sure how they could tell-- but that's cheating :P
Cool!. Tell your sister, your mother, and your friends.. If you want to.
What do you mean?
Which section are you in?
Which number?. If it's number 3, just look up "Parse Server"
Superhuman should work-- that's the one to use.
You just write it, don't "select existing". It's like you're making a "new" one.
Yes.
No problem.. You've got this!
Awesome!. They get back pretty quickly with the email.. Have a nice day today.
Will do.
Keep them coming. They look interesting.
Scraping old paint off the house and meeting with an old classmate.
That's involved.
Wow. Fancy!. I don't know what that tastes like, but a candle makes it perfect!
It's Our Daily Bread, but you can have it all to yourself.. (and have it My Daily Bread). Goodnight. Sleep well.
I miss you quite terribly.
And saying how I feel.. Likely not reciprocated though. That's okay.
It was nice.
We went to Al's Metro Deli and she showed me work she's been working on.
It's a restaurant in Christiansburg.. Technically a college classmate is an old classmate.. The art was decent.
I suppose so... It was nice though. She's working at Logo Hub now, though she says she isn't terribly fond of it.
It's in Christiansburg.. It's next to the Salvation Army
Yep.
Yep. She said that a majority of the work she does involves transferring logos into embroidery software.
She would say the same.
Oh-- she said she gets pretty stressed, because when she does get creative work she has a short turnaround time (like an hour)
She's still working on her portfolio.. So she's using her time away from work to get her portfolio spick and span.. But when it's done, I'm sure she'll start looking for another job.. The one she has now sounds temporary.. It was a nice update. Thanks for listening for as much as you did. I'll let you get to whatever you need to get to.. Goodnight and sleep well.
This might sound strange, but I'm feeling a bit of distance from you.
Yes, but it doesn't seem like you miss me.. Or want me at all for that matter.
Of course. There's always other things.. It's reason enough to end the relationship and find someone who fits the many requirements you have, that I clearly lack.
You don't have to stay with me then. I don't want to hold you back.
But you're not in a relationship you want to be in.
I'm all rough spots.
I don't like living with my parents.
It's not enough for you.
Okay.. Goodnight.
Goodnight.. I hope you sleep well.. I hope you had a nice day.
Thanks. There was a barbeque at my church.. I flew my drone in the open field.
Yep, the pig was pretty good too.. The flying was difficult, but I didn't kill anyone. I came close though.. It was fun. The drone likes to drift.. (I didn't really come close to killing anyone)
Definitely. I think you will enjoy it. Try to fly it in an open field free of humans.. Or be really good at controlling it.. Anyway, I'll discontinue this wall of text before it becomes too great. Goodnight.
I suppose I should limit how often I try to talk to you.. Because that's how we get text walls.
Good morning.. We don't talk much, but that doesn't mean I'm not trying.. What I was saying was that by limiting the amount I try to say that would also limit the text walls.. I feel like I'm trying more.
If you feel fine/content with the amount that we talk, then I suppose you don't have to do anything, but you just have to devout a little more time.. But I understand if you no longer have the time.
I meant that you don't have the time for me, which is fine. I'm just one person, and you can be using your time with many people and activities.
That's good to hear.. I need to get ready for church, so I'll be off now.
I hope you enjoy your day as well.
Whenever you want to chat and talk about events and projects in your life, just say the word.
Church was okay. I felt it was odd talking about converting Native Americans (American Indians to my Pastor).. Jack is running off on secret rendezvous with a female cat that looks similar to him.. I think he has a girlfriend.. What have you been up to?
That's what I thought. Your day sounds nice.. What are you doing October 1st?. It's a Saturday.
Demetri Martin has a show in Chicago, and I know that's pretty far, but he's your favorite..m. I thought we could go, but I know it might sound crazy.
Yeah, that could work.. I can talk to her about it, unless you would rather.. In fact, you can ask her to go to the show with you, and it can be a fun get together with her.
That's going to be a killer show!. I can bring it up with Leyla if you don't want to initiate the idea.
Or from mine :P either or. It'll be Steppin' Out all over again.. Just kidding.. But Leyla wants to see you... so you should act fast.. Act now while supplies last.
Wink wink nudge nudge. Supplies are low! Our managers think we're crazy to have such low  LOW prices!. I'll stop now...
Goodnight and sweet dreams.
It was okay. I saw Molly for a bit today, which was nice.. How was your day?
We mostly looked for the backpack that was supposed to arrive in the mail, but ultimately she took my red backpack as a temporary replacement.
Today I went to church, I came home and set up the xbox 360 for my dad, set up the new wifi-- which is not working. My dad needed help moving things from one garage to another. Then I was helping Molly.
How about for you?. I haven't heard what you did afyer fig skat. After*
Have you been skateboarding from point A to point B?. Have you gotten that good?
Wow!
I guess you don't need me any more.
What do you mean?
I'm scraping paint and whatnot.
What kind of crazy things?
I like to save crazy things for when I'm with you.
I like to share experiences with you. I've been reading some poetry.
Just some old books. Faust and The Faerie Queen.. Anyway.. I'll work on being more interesting.
Wow. I was going to read them, and if I thought they were good, I was going to share them with you.. Or let you read them too.
I haven't finished them yet, but so far.. The Faerie Queen is a large-ish book.. I'll let you know though.
I apologize for being boring.
That's not what it sounds like.. Anyway, goodnight. Have sweet dreams.
I'm not interesting enough to get to know.
Who knows.
You're on my mind when I start my day, but I want to work towards an animation/art career.
I'm studying animation principles and watching classic and modern animated films.
I watched a few films. But that's not enough.
Not long enough
I don't know
No.. Just feeling a lot of pressure.
It's just a lot at once.
An unbearable amount.
Pressure.. That's what we're talking about.
That's not how it feels.. It's passed the deadline, and I'm still failing.
The arbitrary one.. Goodnight
You stopped saying things, so I thought you fell asleep.. Plus it's late and you have school tomorrow.
Your "life coaching" feels like personal attacks.
Personal attacks knock you down, life coaching lifts you up.
Okay.
I'm working on myself. Albeit slowly.
Things don't change so abruptly.. I know I'm not changing as quickly as you expect me to.
No.
Myself.
That. 's good*. It doesn't have to be perfect, because that's what the workshop is for.
Sweet dreams to you too, Leandra. I love you too.. Have a great day tomorrow.
I hope everything is going well.
Is the appointment with Jackie set up?
Got it. So it will still be Wednesday/Thursday?
Nope.
Tomorrow, actually.
I hope you had a nice day.. What did you do?
I've been looking into game design.. I was talking to Cody about possibly making a game with me. Not entirely sure where/how to begin, but there's an add-on for Unity called "RagePixel" that I've been looking at.
Just a bit of research in the various things required.. I made an omelette and chocolate pudding, but not at the same time.
I can just make more for you.
Or I can make chocolate mousse.
I miss you too and yes.. I think about it quite often throughout my day, but I don't act on it, though I know I should.. I just thought that I could do a fun project before I have a job.
You're right.
What's not for everyone?
I can work.. And I want to work.
I like working, I'm just finding it difficult to apply.. Never mind.
No... I should figure this out. Sorry to drag you down.. Or to drag myself down.. That's not to say I don't need help, but I shouldn't rely on it.. Anyway. Goodnight and sleep well.. (This isn't a "get out of the conversation," it's just late.)
I will. I have a list of jobs. I will write the many cover letters required, have someone look over them, and send the applications.
We will see.. I will get started in the morning.
Anyway, sweet dreams, Leandra.
Hopefully baby elephants are involved.. Maybe some other animals too.
Oh no!. Not monsters!. The baby elephants will protect you, I'm sure!. I guess wishing for your sweet dreams last night didn't work so well... That's just my fault.. I need to be wishing harder.
I'll be sending cute animal waves to you.. Hopefully at least one sticks.. Then you can have at least one defend against the monsters.
Tuck tuck!. Sleep tight too.
Good morning. I hope you have a delightful day.
Thank you.
3:15
Yep yep.. I just got back from the Chiropractor.. Believe it or not, it's not actually in Egypt.
It went well. I was given some stretches to help.. The doctor thinks that my issue is muscle related, and not so much spine related.. So adding the stretches/exercises to a routine should help.. Have you made the call yet?. (To Jackie)
She said there is slight scoliosis, but it's not the problem.. So I would take it Friday? Or Thursday?
You got me.. (Yes, I'm free.). Thanks for the call.
Any time!. Just so you're aware, I'm free Friday.. I got your back-- or car.... I'll go to the skate park with you if you don't go Friday.. And I can take your car to you and find a ride back down.. If you don't find a ride / there are more fun things in Charlottesville.
Up to you.. How goes the code?
Okay. I'll get the embarrassing photos ready.. Thanks for the update.
That's the one.
And the line of code promised?. Another thing you could do is use an old line of code, and I'd be none the wiser.
I see!. I was just kidding about preparing the embarrassing photo.. Or... teasing.. Slackers slackline and Slackline Industries slackline ($63 and $55 respectively) are rated fairly well.. Doesn't seem like a whole lot either.
Yeah, if you don't want versatility.. And an easy set up.. Just kidding-- I have no idea-- I just know it wasn't on the list I was reviewing.
Of course. I was just looking for the "best" ones.. That doesn't mean it's not good though.
They met and... fell in love? :3
But they secretly have feelings for one another? :3
Oh... Okay :/
No... it's fine. Some things aren't meant to be.. Sweet dreams to you too.. Your code checks out, so I suppose you are safe for now.
I'm glad you got it to me.. You can now rest easy knowing the picture from the New Years Eve party isn't going up.. Goodnight and sleep well.
Sweet dreams.. Good morning
Have a swell day today.. I've tried to update my resume... I wanted to include how I've helped in games in the past, but I decided against it.. I have applied to SuperCell (it's a game studio). I've applied to other places, but it was more of a "bulk" application.. I have 5 more that I'm looking at to apply to, but I'm going to try to tailor the cover letter to those ones-- because I'm "more" interested.
I hope coding goes well.
I mean-- a little concerned the the doc is blank.. But I believe you can pull through.. I still believe in you.
Good job!
Wow!. I would say that should count for tomorrow, but I won't!
You deleted my love for you from the doc...
I didn't think it would be so easy for you.... I'm just being joke dramatic.
Maybe it was real and I'm trying to brush it away :P
Just a way to end the conversation instead of awkwardly addressing it?. Just kidding.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Awesome!. Good morning!
It was good. A bit sore today though.. Question:
Do you think I should take the car today and pick it up tomorrow?
Okay!. I suppose I could take it down tonight, and then you and I could pick it up tomorrow.. But I will wait until I know for sure.. Thank you!
It doesn't stand for anything any more.. It used to, but it doesn't now.
8. I have 5 more I'm working on.
I will try.. Make the call yet?
Oh.. Okay.. Do you still need me to help?
I just wanted to help.... And I thought I might be able to see you as well.. It's fine though.. I did consider getting the car jack for you though.
I'll be down. Especially on a ramp.. Except I'm not ready for one of those.. Kidding aside, I said I would several days ago.
Sure. Don't forget about the stop nuts in your room.. When would we go?
So both times?. Before and after?. Sounds good to me.
Okay.. Is there anything you want from me when you see me?
Just checking. I thought that you might still want pudding.
Sooo?. What do you say?
Even if it's just waiting for you?
Okay!. ?Now what if it was chocolate mousse. ?*. Probably the same...
Anything else you might like?. I guess not.
From where?
Oh, that's pretty close!. I just might be able to.
When can I expect you again? 12pm?
Got it.
That's the angriest looking "rawr" I've ever seen.. I miss you too, rawr. (I was just kidding, I don't think you're angry)
That's an adult.. I thought it was an actual kid :P
I suppose. Definitely worthy of the Pom Wonderful TM Run of the Night.. Kidding aside, she was quite the cool kid.
My day was okay. How was yours?
I've dedicated some of my day to applications, working on my stop motion puppets, working on a t-shirt design for Molly, and whatnot. What about you?
I designed plans to make the arms and legs of the tinman out of popsicle sticks. I would have actually made them, but I don't have any popsicle sticks.
Painting to look like copper. I'm going to make it look like tin through photo manipulation.. It will be faster this way.
No, it's for a quick photoshoot.. One day though...
Your code looks fishy.. Oh... photoshopping something in is more difficult than photoshopping something into something new.
Did you really finish your code then? Or were you hoping I wouldn't notice?. Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too.
I have half the mind to not count that one.. See you tomorrow.. Good morning.. Have a safe trip.
Okay, see you then.
On my way
Yes. Anything I should bring?
Safe and sound at home.. No need to lose any sleep, because I'm all tucked in myself. Thanks for spending time with me. I wish I could have stayed longer, but I think the stay was perfect the way it was.. Good morning
How did you sleep?. Did you want to tackle the hill with the skateboard and fly the drone?
I slept well too.. When would you like to go? You probably need to get ready... so maybe 11:50?
Oh.. no worries. Take as long as you want.. How does 1 or 2 sound?. It can be later though.
You sure? I don't want to take up mother daughter time.
Leaving now. Sorry for being late.0
Here
Except I forgot the drone :/
I can go back
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay.. Would you like to go on a date with me? I know it's a bit sudden, but Kubo and the Two Strings is playing at Franks Cinebowl, and there's a showing at 7pm (or 9:30pm). I understand if your busy, of course.. You're*
Neither am I. It was just a movie I was particularly interested in.
Thanks for the rejection. I at least made an effort
You want me to make plans/dates, but you don't like them, and you don't make alternatives.. Sorry. I'm just hurt from earlier.. Because you were saying you wanted to do something, then make no suggestions until you told me to go home.. The tone was "well at least I tried". Or "I gave it my all, but you win some and you lose some"
I don't think you tried very hard :/
I suppose I'm not worth the effort.. Would you like to eat the calzone tonight?. Or I can stop trying...
What's the correct conclusion? To try more? Putting effort into something that's unwanted is wasted effort.
My conclusion is that I'm not worth your time and effort, not that I'm not worth effort in general.. I will go focus on something else. I don't know what happened to you, but I guess you don't want to see me much any more, so I hope you have a nice rest of your weekend.
You still want to punch me?
That's okay.. We can box so you can get it out of your system.
Yeah.. I don't have any boxing gloves though. We can wrap our hands though.
Okay. When would you like to?
Oh... okay.. For some reason, I had the idea in my head that you would want to see me again tonight.
I made chocolate mousse... maybe you would like some after calzones?
I can bring it to you tonight.. Let me know when you want to eat. I was going to suggest 7 or 8. It can be sooner.. There's homemade whipped cream as well.
See you then
I'm home.. So I'm safe. I feel terrible though.. I hope you sleep well.. Sweet dreams, Leandra!. I was trying really hard to comfort you :/. Sorry...
Thanks. It's not your fault. It's mine.
You were fine. I shouldn't have over stayed my welcome.. Good morning.. Have a good day today. I can still help with the Goodwill trip.
When are you available then?
You had plans with your mother though.
So it would be a quick trip and then I leave?
You can spend your time with your motherm. Mother.*. M is right above the period :P. I'm available now... do you need help getting Goodwill items together?
Okay. I can arrive by 12:10. Does that work for you? Or do you need more time? 12:30?
I just want to get ready for you :P
Oh.. video call I suppose.
Very. Do I need to bring anything?. You wanted to "spar"?
Okay. How should we do that? Tape pillows to your hands?. Also, I don't want to be late, so I'm going to push the time to 12:20.
I tried to tell you before, but I somehow got stuck in traffic.. I am safe. I hope you sleep really well. I love you! I hope to see you bright and early!
Definitely, but I'm late!. Good morning.. I can be right over though. Need me to bring anything?. Or just me?. I can't come until I get an answer
Those are in Radford. Any reason why you need them? I can do the spare parts though.
I have watercolors and paper. It's usually faster to paint.. I also have illustrator or photoshop, if you want to use those programs
Watercolors take less time.. Because it's a quick brush stroke, and pencils are several marks. Up to you. I'll bring both. Or just the the pencils.. Do you need paper?
Do you want more chocolate mousse?
Wow! You're a rockstar!. Have a great rest of your day!. I'm glad you're safe.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you!. I can send the $60 to you.. I just need to confirm the last 4 digits of your account so I can p2p you
(hug)
Thanks. Sent! (:. I deleted those messages too, just to be safe.
Don't worry (:. You were with me for half the day, so you're fine!. Goodnight (:
Good morning! I love you too!
No problem (:. I hope you have a great day today!
Thanks (:. Wow! You invited me to a thing?
Wow!. That's so cool!
Sounds like law abiding citizens.
I will see if I can use the car that weekend!
Sure! I bet it will be better than the last comedy show I went to.. And it'll be fun with you.
That would be much appreciated.
It looks very nice.. And I can use the car that weekend.
Hmm... I am fine on the couch, if that isn't weird.. But if you wanted me "all to yourself" then the airbnb is a good option.
Yeah.. I suppose it's just as much as your decision as it is mine. I would be comfortable in a box :P
Eep. The airbnb is the top contender for me. What about for you?
I can get more quad copters too.
Could probably fill a bathtub with all the $$
Wow, I'll see you before 2 weeks then!. '0'. A couple of days, even.. I made this for Molly.
Mhmm
I guess you will!. Unless something bad happens to me.
Well.. I can't see the future, so I'll be there unless something prevents me from doing so!. You will see me Friday! :P
I will!. I hope you'll be ready for me.
Sweet dreams!. Anything you need me to bring?. You have until Thursday to decide.
Goodnight!. Good job on the coding!. Your two favorite things: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GVO-MfIl1Q
Good morning!. Yeah, I think it's called a "penny board," but I could be wrong.. It has pretty good griptape still :P
It Came From the Closet by R. L. Stine.. Actually the garage.. But I don't know where it came from before that.
I don't remember saying anything "wow" worthy!
There's a boxing bag-- one of the long ones :P. Not just a ham sized one.
I know!. Now you can punch something other than me!. https://www.humblebundle.com/gamemaker-bundle. This is a pretty good deal for GameMaker (It's $150 or so on Steam). And you can pay $1-15. I'm not sure what your game studio uses, but it could be something they could use too.. I'm taking your car tomorrow 10am. Chvrches sounds pretty good live..!
Oh, cool!. We'll $15 isn't a lot for a pretty decent game making program.. I also like Band of Horses, but I think that's one you were excited for.
I think so. It's the Studio Professional version.. Depending on the amount you choose to play, you can export to android and ios.. Since it's the Pro version you can sell the games.. As long as you own the sprites, images, and sounds.. It's just a thought. You could bring it up with your team. It's a pretty good deal.. Ahh! Great Wall of Text!
Good!. How was your day today?
You have your own almond butter too.
My day was alright. Went to Jackie's to pick up the car. I got the car jack for you, because I think it will come in handy in the future.
A referral? I can't go back to Thrive or they will charge me for the annual membership fee.. I was in for the almond butter, and then I was out.
I wasn't exaggerating the cancellation process.. I can't go back either way :P
Wow. You can export games to html5, android, and ios from gamemaker!. Undertale was made in gamemaker, and we all saw how big that got... it was even mentioned in your game design class!
It didn't take that much time. You have to wait for the package to arrive, then you go to "Frequently Asked Questions" then you click on "Cancel Membership" (or a question pertaining to that)
You cancel, then you will receive an email to confirm your cancellation, then you will receive another email, and then another email, and then a final email saying you're membership has been cancelled.
It depends on how frequent the emails come in, total time spent was probably tops 30 minutes, but you have to wait for the emails.. It didn't take very long, just make sure you're busy while you wait.
The email wants you to reply to it. Just say something like "Please cancel the membership"
The email will also try to get you to sign up for something else, so maybe "I do not wish to continue with the Thrive Membership, please cancel the current membership". Or something.... I am looking at game design, to answer that question at the top of the text wall. I am interested in making a few games.
I will!. Not really sure what I'll make in gamemaker, but I have some game ideas floating around in my noggin.
Mostly errands.
Wow! Your mouth is so wide.. you could fit an entire cookie in there!
Sounds awesome!. I should too! I have a big day ahead of me.
Whoa! So early!. I am taking your car to Fain's Tire and Auto. It's a big responsibility.. When would be a good time to come on Friday?
Okay. You still need to think about what I should bring with me (other than essentials)
You sure? It can be anything you want :P
I hope you sleep tight too! Goodnight.
Good morning!!
Taking your car, sorry
The car has been dropped off, so I could take a call now. Are there any errands you need for me to do? I'm just waiting on the car.
Sure. Yes*. You were thinking TJ Maxx l!. I think at least.... Which is across from Target, so it wasn't very out of the way. I got you gloves!
Yeah! I got you small blue ones.
I also got a thinner pair that is purple.. Just in case!
Gotta give you options!. I thought the different gloves could suit the different tasks you have.
Of course!. The tie rod replacement is taking quite some time. I hope I can return the car in time.. http://imgur.com/X5ClMDm
No I was able to get it to your mother as school let out.
Yep! No worries!. (hug). I love you!
Yay!. :3. I wanted to go to a poster show, but I remembered too late :/
I can try to go another day, but today was pretty convenient.. Remind me.. what time was good for you tomorrow?. Was it 10am?
Whoa.. breakfast?. That took a turn for the best!. 10am works for me then.. I'll let you know if anything changes.
Need me to pick you up?
Where will you be around 10am?
Okay!. You confused me for a moment :P. Need me to bring anything?
Want me to wear anything in particular?. Do you want* me to bring anything?
Just checking. I can wear something nice for you.
Uh oh... maybe not something as nice as I was planning...
I hope you sleep well too!. I love you!
I can get a replacement thing
0935
If only I hadn't already stopped.. I can just wait.
Yes.. I don't mind waiting, of course.
No. I can look again. I was waiting by the valley house.
By that, I mean. I parked on the road, not on the street.. How far away should I park?
What do you mean?. Park where I usually do on Valley Road, or park on the street before that?. Should I park on Jefferson Park Ave?. Is that what you mean?
Oh. I'm parked.. Street sounds like I should be elsewhere.. Oops...
I slapped my phone after stretching by accident.. I'm parked.. How much more time do you need?
Okay! Where are we having breakfast?
I parked in the usual spot.

You are a beautiful person.
Aww :$. That's what you said before :P
It's funny stuff!. But  I mean it! :3
Oh! I'm home!. Safe. Thanks!
Mhmm! I'm having lunch with Paige and Katy!. Thank you for giving me a great start to my Birthday!
:3. Thank you for being an awesome girlfriend!. I played sims now my whole day is gone.. Just kidding, but I fell asleep, and it was the same thing.
I'm awake now though! Time to do things 22 year old people do!
Just gotta keep dancing!
Yes. I'll spend my Birthday reading advice :P. Just kidding! I will, thank you!!!
Thank you!. I'm your favorite number!!!
Abusement Park stuck!. Thanks to you, I no longer live in fear.
Safety only lasts for so long... but soon winter will return
Dun!
I'll miss you too!. Good job!. Sweet dreams, cutie pie!
I love you, Leandra!. Stay comfy!
Eep!!!. Good morning!
It's me!. And it's you!!!. I'm an old man now.
I'm not sure if they do, but I want to say no.
I already registered it though. Am I able to do so twice?
Uh oh :P. Okay. I can re-register it then.. I can wait and see if someone has a citibank card.
Cool!. I will get back to you when I find out!
I have access to two!
Got your pack!
:P
That's a big list there.. I'm not sure how I could add to it.. Seems to cover most ideas. I was thinking about a grocery app, where the app recognizes a food item and recommends a recipe.
I can try to think/help more!
Whoa.. really? Oh-- you're in a team?
Cool stuff!. I'm glad that I could have "inspired" your idea... somewhat?. Not to take credit, or anything.... I keep missing phone calls from your mother.
I have called back, but no luck.
I miss you too!. I saw you yesterday though!!. And I'll see you Friday!!!
I'm looking forward to Friday too!!!
Goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra!
*tuck* *tuck*. Oh no... weird lion...
Just like me!. :P
:3. I think you're cute!!. Have a great day today!
Wow!!!. All the sandwiches can be yours!. Or coffee-- if that's what you're into.
That's you drinking beverages!. That you can get from Starbucks "P
How is your day going? I get to see you in two!
I'm sure! If you need a pass on tonights coding problem, feel free to.. I've been thinking about what you said before, and I think I should be animating more.
Both would be really cool! But I would really like to be an animator.
And if I worked on web comics, maybe that would give me "storyboard" practice.
I'm not very familiar with 3d, so I'll stick with what I know.
I suppose you're right! I feel there's still so much to learn in the 2d space though.. Good luck with the rest of your work!
I had no luck getting a citi card. I was hoping I could use yours.. I can wait. I know you're busy. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Awesome!
The earlier we leave the more things we can see/do in Georgia.
Of course! I know you want to see fishies!
Okay.. I think it will be $2 for a Breeze card which is needed to park at MARTA. We won't be buying the additional fare since we won't be taking a bus, so it might just be $2 for the whole time we stay. The SAGE parking garage is $1 every 30 minutes and a maximum of $15.
The card costs $2.. The fare varies I think. But it's like $2 to travel, but we won't be.. I'm not even sure if we need to pay the $2, but the parking lot is only for MARTA customers.
Sounds like we wouldn't be using the service properly.. There are two station near Piedmont Park, Midtown Station and Arts Center Station.. MARTA has free daily parking. Overnight parking is $5-8. The card is only used to pre-load fare.. So we don't even need that.. And overnight parking is still cheaper than the parking lot option.
Walking is not an option though-- we should take a bus.. Or some form of transit.
The closest MARTA station that has parking is the Lindbergh Center, but it's 59 minutes away if walking.. But only 12 by car, and 24 by bus.
What do you mean? Parking is limited around the park. I think the best plan would be to park at Lindbergh Center station and take a bus (or taxi) to the park.
I think we should take the bus to the park. I don't know what you mean by "planning it out". Do you mean specific times?
The bus fare, from what I saw, costs $1.75. $7 for two both ways
I'm not sure if MARTA does local bus transit, but that costs $2.50 if it does
The SAGE parking garage is the closest that I have seen.. It just will cost $15.. Your mother would like you to let her know when you depart.
Awesome!
Probably! Aren't you?
She's more than one character.. Not to be picky though. I hope you have a safe trip.. I hope I didn't upset you.. I just felt that calling a person a name based on a role they played is almost like how my dad calls you "Lee Lee". He doesn't mean anything by it, but it's not your name and you don't like it.
Yes, you gave them to me.. Remember?
You don't have them, right :P. I can't check at the moment. I know you handed me the enveloped, but I haven't opened it to know if it is indeed the wristbands.
No problem. Don't forget anything important!
Okay! Do you need help packing?. I'm glad you're safe.. Maybe?. I can help pack the car.. Or do anything you need.... I meant the maybe for maybe I can help you pack.
I can prepare the food.. Or at least some of it!. I can make "om the road" soup. What would you like?
Whoa!. Say thank you for me!!!. Want me to make soup anyway?. Or I can make you a spice mix of what I put in the soup :P. Oh! I can freeze soup for you!
Okay. Goodnight! Need me to bring anything for you? A Fanny Pack and?
Oh.. those things? You sure?. Maybe I can bring your elephant backpack instead?
Anything else?
Okay. Goodnight!
You know it!. Any last minute thoughts of what we need?
Sunblock?
Oh no! I'm not sure if I have any. I will check!. Found some!
I had a bite to eat!!
Maybe not, but I can bring a lil something something.
Should I get Spotify premium for a 7 day trial?
Okay.. I have sunglasses already. Do you need a pair?. I can download the midtown music 2016 playlist. :P. Should I save this for a cross country trip?
Bug spray?. Would you like for me to drive this morning?
Want me to download any for you?. How long do you imagine you will be? Maybe I can go to the bank and back?
Which audio books do you want me to download? Or are you getting them through spotify?
Anything else?
Mine is fairly long.. The one I'm bringing. I don't think I have anything longer.
Yay!. Awesome! I'm a sleep zombie!. I had a dream in which my brother came to wake me up, but I explained to him that I'm sleeping because of the concert.. There's meatloaf, and I am excite.. I hope you have a great day!!!!!!1. I wish I didn't bother you so much while I was driving :P
I see you too are excite for meatloaf!. (But Peter, that's bread loaf)
Is Timeless that TV show you were talking about?. About the time travel?
Cool! So you wanted to watch that? Maybe the pilot at least?. I can't wait to hug you more.. Enjoy Twenty One Pilots!. Just kidding again :P. I hope you had a great day!. I'm glad I could have been the start to it!. I'm also glad you had an umbrella!. Been a part of the start of your day*. I love you! Good luck with everything!
Awesome!. I'm sorry you didn't sleep well before.
I'm trying to take the wristband off without damaging it, but the website gives a bad explanation on how to do so, and it's a new type of wristband.. I've only managed to make it tighter and more uncomfortable.. I've also damaged the wristband, so I failed in my goal.
Right. I just want to take mine off.. And I can't.. Okay.. I don't believe you could get out of handcuffs.
My internet is down, so I can't find a way for me to get out.. I'll just cut it off :/. There aren't any tutorials on how to take it off, if you think it's odd that I'm complaining.. I feel bad that instead of "helping" in anyway, you just boasted that you could take yours off.
I'm in a bind, I'm not talking about the weather.. It's uncomfortable and frustrating and I need help.
I wanted to keep it without damaging it.. It might be okay, if I had two hands, but I'm alone in this endeavor and no one knows how on the internet.. It really hurts, but I don't want to cut the strap
I can't break the plastic. It's not easily accessible on my wrist.
No...
Goodnight.
:/
Sweet dreams to you!. *tuck* *tuck*. What would you like to do for halloween?
No ideas either.. And you're welcome!. Good morning! Catch up on sleep?
I think so!
I'm not entirely sure yet. What about for you?
Awesome! Seeing your sister? That's exciting!. Sounds like a great day! I hope you enjoy it!!!!
Om nom!. Maybe Kelsey will be there!
You can spell Kelsie more than one way? Whoa. It would be cool!
I've never heard of that term before.
Philanthropist
Adventurer & Legend. Fun seeker?
"Not robot"?
Very Spffy!
It's pretty cool looking!. It doubles as a headshot for modeling and acting agencies.. I like the blue color.. Spiffy indeed :P
It's great! Just like you!
No?. It could be. How was Poke?
Awesome!. Try anything new?
Sounds delicious!. I assume you didn't see Kelsie, because if you did, you would be raving about how cool she is.
How is your sister?
Oh! That's pretty cool!. How goes the homework?
Ah.. the second quadrant.
Oh-- I assumed your homework was due sooner. And you already have a job lined up, so that makes applying to jobs seem to be less urgent.
But cool!. I've been helping Cody with his websites.
I'm also looking at jobs.
Whoa!
Slow down! You might scare the prey away!. Then the world???
Sounds awesome! I applied to Airbnb, but I was rejected.
Like I am now
I'd say you're doing well
That final "next" doesn't work :P
So much for living for details
Just kidding
It's pretty cool
Coolness!. Messenger has secret chats now. That's what the notification said...
Sweet dreams, Leandra.. *tuck* *tuck*. Did you still want less conversation?
Oh, okay.. I just heard the song you like, and it made me think of you.. Goodnight.
And I thought that's what you want :P
I haven't made any plans. What about you?
Oh. Were you going to suggest something?
That sounds pretty cool
Okay!. I hope you have a nice day!. I just remembered!!. Trail riding would mean you'd be wearing those cool pants, right?!?
Cool.. cool...
Squeek
Quack
That sounds like it would make an interesting video game concept
It assumes males are violent, because the designer is catering to a male audience
Yes
And women can be just as violent, so it's unfair to them
To women, who also want to be violent, but the designer assumes they are male.
It makes them sad?
Because they just want to participate in violence, but it's thought to be a male only trait
Maybe it makes people assume women cannot be violent?. So you assume you're safe around women.
I'm herebto bounce ideas off ofm. Of*. Here to*. Silly thumbs...
Sound good
Since the dawn of time... there were video games. It was long believed that the fabled games were designed solely for men.... But a prophecy would soon reveal.... That that is all kinds of wrong.
I'll try to think of something more serious.
Hmm.. another problem is that some games that women play, people don't consider to be "real" video games, or hold less merit than what they deam to be true video games, which further keeps women out of the industry.. I'm also seeing surveys from the 70's and 80's that show that computers had a perceived masculinity, and since that was around the beginning of video games, the creators probably marketed to males because of this perception.. Since the creation of the computer, many perceived it as masculine. Video games targeted a male audience for this reason, which has led the industry to be male dominated ever since.
I'm reading that right now :P. But the industry kind of targeted the male demographic before that.
The lull was after the crash in 1983, it resumed after 1985 with the introduction to the NES
But really, the lull began in the late 70's to the early 80's until it crashed in 1983.
And video games had only been around for a short time before that.. Like, 1975.. The problem then, was there wasn't a demographic. Companies released anything in order to make money, it didn't have to be a quality product.. And I'm looking at old advertisements. They still look to be targeting a male audience.
Whenever I saw a female, she was accompanied by a male.
I can't think of many.. Centipede and asteroids, maybe...
I didn't find it to be factual enough to continue reading.
But that may have been due to other reasons. How did the paper go?
You're cool!. There's a new commercial with Demetri Martin as a gardener!. Also, you should be happy to know that Modern Family is back :P
Indeed. https://youtu.be/0YESqbofTJc. That's the link.. To the commercial
Oh no.... Legend says it is the worst thing to have graced the earth. It was put to rest, but you found it. You've awoken it.. It doesn't help that Bob Hoskins is in it.. Do you need to watch it for homework?
Did you want to watch it with me?. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I hope your homework went well!
It was due at midnight though :o
I didn't mean to die.. I thought I was making the same face again, but dead.
Sorry, I can't talk right now. Dead.. Sleep tight
Don't let the bed bugs nibble on your toes!. Good morning
Hiya there. How are you today?
I'm doing well too+
What do you mean?
For trail riding?. That's up to you. How busy are you? I assume fairly busy, but if you come, then we can set time aside to do work. I can be your rubber duck again.
Hmm.... Before I forget, did you receive the payment?
Awesome!. Anyway... I would be thrilled to see you, but I know I can always see you another time (:. I know you have time to, of course! :p
Poor quagga
It's okay. There there
That's me! Your friendly neighborhood friend guy.
I love you
So cool! I hope all is well today (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Anything cool happening on campus tomorrow?
Makes sense!. I hope you have a good time then!. I hope you can catch up on anything important
Nothing that I know of. The poster show is still going on at Radford though, so that's a neat thing.
Whoa!!!. That's pretty cool
Open to more than students?
Ah. Always a catch
Wow... maybe you should check it out
There's also the Thai This truck that's supposed to be good!. I suppose it may be there :P. It will be a nomtastic event for sure.
Sweet dreams, Leandra! I love you!!
Good morning, Cutie Pie!. Happy Friday!
Time will tell. I was thinking about drawing a comic and make more job applications. What about for yourself?
Fun times!. Fun times to be had, indeed!
I hope you do too! (:
Nothing particularly special
Oh! You're thanking me now? :P
Well... you're welcome!!. Thank you for being such a good passenger!. Do you need me to make the drive again?
Okay! :D
I love you too!!
You're in Blacksburg?
I'm terribly sorry for being so slow
Sure, when is it?
Wow!
My house is the parking
More than likely. I can check though.
There's still parking here and my mother would be happy to accommodate.
Be safe! Technically there are signs that say not to downtown.. And that sounds nice
Would you rather have me pick you up?
Not sure.. It shouldn't be hard. The lot isn't full yet
I can come pick you up nowm. Now*
Safe
Any time! I'm here for you
I think you are too
Nothing. Well.. not really nothing. I just haven't started anything important in hopes I would see you
I am not. The event starts as soon as church concludes and then continues for maybe 1 or 2 hours
12 ish usually
Not completely ready. Are you interested in going?. I wasn't all that interested.
Are you ready?
Neat
Yes. I'm ready
Across the street behind the gold mercury
There is a car there. Park in the back please.
I can store it
Sorry I couldn't be more help
Wow!!!! Yeah, I would like to help (:
What is the team looking for?
Hmm... I can rough something out. I'm thinking a few swords could break, but then one doesn't because it's shatterproof
What does the team think?
What kind of art are they looking for?
I can do vector, hand drawn, and stop motion
Okay. My day has been alright. I'm working on channel art for Kb and whatnot. How was yours?
Just pencil sketches so far
Yep. That's what it is. Kind of-- anyway. He just liked the idea of having a similar name
Oh! Sorry. I. I've just been working on a few things. I applied to a few more jobs and I've been doing some sketching/drawing
No :/
Sweet dreams to you! I love you!
That river looks like a road. Also, I'm glad the umbrella is being used!. Qdoba is coming to Blacksburg!. I just drove passed it.
Cool!
More stuff for Kb
I don't think another preview is ready. I've mostly been working on font choices and designing those. Do you have more details for the Shatterproof animation?
Nothing much else.
Yes
I suppose. I've cooked, I've eaten, I filled up on gas at kroger.. just odds and ends. I get the feeling you're disappointed though
I'm feeling good. How are you feeling. ?*
That's good. What did you do today?
Sounds great
Pavlov would be proud.. :P
I hope you had a nice day today.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I hope you have safe travels tomorrow.
Thank you!. I'm sorry for not being around.
I don't know.. I didn't even say good morning.
Okay. That's good then.
It was good. How was yours?
That's awesome
More of the same.
I'm safe. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Tuck tuck!. Good morning
I'm excited
Wow... what a coincidence.
No, me! :P. I woke my mother up so she could get ready though...
Yes. Did you want me at the music festival?. Or just music event?
Oh! Okay!
Is it mother and daughter time?
Have a good time then!
I love you!. (:
Now??. What will we do?. Should I be fancy or ready to play?
Alright!. Molly is coming home to visit at 7:30, so I may go home to see her. You're welcome too, of course!. Leaving now
Thanks! She needs to leave soon though D:
And she's gone :'(. Time to be alone
There are sausages and cornbread here.... That's okay! Enjoy your time with your mother.
Not the kind you like though. The apple chicken wasn't available
Mrs. Hastings
I'll see!. Her name was Mrs. Hastings.. Is*. Still is...
Whoa.. ramen donut?. That sounds pretty cool/tastu. Tasy*. Tasty******
Sounds like a date!
Sweet dreams to you! What time do you want to see me?
Oh. You don't want to go to the park?
That's okay!. I can warm you up
I'll pick you up at 7:25
Sleep tight!. Tuck tuck!
Okay. Running late. Be there soon though. Leaving now
Wearing a sweater and bringing pants
Should I bring anything?. Change your mind?
I've misplaced my wacom. But I know what you mean. Anything else. There's a lot of cornbread
I'll take one. My legs are too sore to hop. Won't be the same, but it'll get the job done
Yeah, no problem. I think I gave you a good amount of time. Should I come over soon?
You sure?. Need anything?. Or should I come after 2:30 so that I don't distract you from your deadline?
Right... I should give you some alone time then.
Okay. I'm sorry. I don't know how much work you'll get done if I'm there. Can I come over around 1? That way I can have lunch and I won't be eating too much of your food.
I guess I don't know how much fun I'll be having.
What would you do for that break?
Fishbowl?
Sorry. I was talking to someone. I'll leave now
I do. I'm alone anyway, so I can come over and be alone there.. See you in a bit.
Safe. You gave me a weird feeling like I wasn't wanted around. Sorry if I did anything. I wanted to ride horses with you, it just wasn't for me... so I'm sorry for preventing you from going tomorrow. I hope you have a good day tomorrow and I hope you get a lot done. Sleep well for now.
With who?. I only felt that way based on how you were acting.. Enjoy the horses.. I'll see you around. I'm glad I didn't ruin your riding plans.
I wanted to go with you, but okay.. Do what you want to do.. That's a "but okay, that's your decision" not a passive aggressive "but okay". I know it can be interpreted as such.. I feel bad that you no longer want to spend time with me though.
Of course. Any time!
I would like to be with you. You don't have to bribe me though
Sure
Right now?
Maybe.... Could always get ready together
Yes. I don't know what you were thinking.
I don't have a car, so I would appreciate being picked up
Later, unless you want to see me sooner
Whoa.. Well I'll be ready in a bit. You're welcome to pick me up and have some cornbread
Sooner than I'll be ready :]
That's me.. You can come at that time. Cornbread can keep you company
I will be ready in 5-10 minutes
9:25
Oh no! Come inside! I'll be right down
Can you park?
No. I can be down sooner than that.. Should I bring anything? Cornbread.. ?*
Rawr to you!. I'm awake. When would you like for me to come over?
So now?
Okay!
I do not, but I can walk. I'm going to head out now. Do you have any preferences for what I wear?
We were going to get ready together, remember?
I would join you, but I'm a bit sore. I can do some of the exercises though. I can join you, for a few of them
Yes, I'm just warning you that I can't do 100%
I know
This isn't exercise sore. This is "I got hurt" sore
Oh.. okay
Wait! :/. I was supposed to help.. Did you change your mind?
I really wanted to.... But it's fine.. I don't mind how presentable you are.
Should I also be ready then? I was holding out hoping.
Okay :/. Noon is fine.
Alright. I was jusy hoping for more than homework. Plus, it wasn't like I was with you.. just*
I didn't feel welcome the first time.. I haven't left yet though. I'm still sitting on your porch.. Can I come back now?
I'll be fine if you don't spend time with me.. I'm safe
How many of the frozen meals? Five? For sure?
A ton of yogurts.
Goodnight
Okay! Good morning. I'm here now, because I didn't want to have you wait for the car. I'll wait until you're ready though
Do you need help?. Just let me know. I'm a few steps away
A little chilly. I'm staying in the car though. You have 3 more frozen meals in my freezer after the 4 you requested. Just to update you
Of course! Any time. Enjoy ddr
I'm sure.
It's been a while. Likely with you at Squires. I don't think I can give a fair estimate
I haven't. I don't have the game.. That's at your house :P
Well, I don't know if either will work. I know of a place that can resurface the disc though. A few places, actually.. Only two places....
Oh, yeah? It was a stubborn disc, so I suppose I forgot.. The mat likely works, but we will see. Goodnight.. Sleep well. I hope you had a great day
It sure is!. Sleep well!
Thanks.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN29b1-hhZ0&feature=youtu.be
Yeah, I can be a workout partner. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OvD6y2FCI. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuJ4BBQ0nhc. I should send you videos you care about :P. Good luck with all of your work.
I don't think you've shown it to me yet
I will see
Yeah! They have senior showcases
I'll try to find one
I should look at both
Haha :P
And it's in English now
Which video?
Oh wow. I've seen that before.
Yeah, but it's for fms students
I don't discriminate... I've done many races. Oh no.. I'm not sure if my website is functioning properly
I already sent it.
And I don't have anything for my portfolio
Yeah, thanks for the heads up
Not just kidding. He has already replied back. He's interested in the Curse of the Werekitten illustration
I don't know what to say though, because that was made of clay
He asked if I could make animations similar to that illustration
I think he just wants it to look as detailed. Or textured
I'm not sure.. You shared a link and removed it?
What was it?
Oh :P. I just couldn't click anything, but it's fine. I think my computer was just slow. I made a lil discussion with him. I need details to know how I can better make his animation
I love you too!!. Sweet dreams!. Here's hoping I will get the job. Just have wait for another response.
May be a bit, since it is late. Unless I wasn't clear in my message! Then he may never respond!!!
I just said that I have done stop motion before, but depending on when he needs it by, the quality could vary based on style.
I'm not sure. I could have a texture overlay the animation in Adobe After Effects
He said he doesn't have a lot of experience, but from what he knows, he knows it could take some time.. But I assured him that it can take more or less time depending on what needs to be included.
Yeah, I asked for a "brief" like the story, and whatnot.
Goodnight!. I'll see what he says in the morning.
I love you too!. No response yet.. Gettin' nervous. He's probably waiting to see who responds before he commits to any single person.
That too. Sorry for missing your call
I hope you are too. No classes today, so what did you do instead?
Romantic star gazing with a friend?. I've been making a catelog of animation resources and learning materials.
You certainly go on a lot of adventures with friends that sound like dates. May be why Sam (?) asked you out.
I'm sorry. I'm just jealous that you would spend your time with me doing homework, but fun "date" stuff with friends.. Not your fault though, just jealousy speaking. I shouldn't behave that way.. I'm sorry though.. I don't want you to feel bad
I'm not upset. Just a little disappointed that I don't get to do those things. I hope your friend doesn't think of it as a date though.. I hope you have a good time.
Thanks.. Goodnight
Sleep tight.. I hope it's not raining. The clouds may affect your view in the observatory.
Oh, okay. That's good then. I hope you had a good time
That's goid. Good*. My thumbs! Always typing the wrong thing. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I'm sorry for being so mean earlier.
If you say so!. But if you're feeling hurt, you can always punch me. Because I know you like to punch things.
Well.. you can punch me anyway. Because it makes you giggle :P
Okay, well.. up to you then.. Sleep well.
Oh, hello.
I miss you too!. Oh no! I've been uprooted!!
It was my pleasure.. What are you doing up so late?
Oh... I hope you are/were having fun
I'm alright. Chatting with Cody, Andrew, and Kb was here.. No word from Tony. I think he is weighing his options.
We'll see.. Sleep tight!. I'll be awake for a little bit longer.
I can be a rubber duck too
Not particularly. We built a wall to keep our city safe.. And we built a castle.
And the villagers. And piggies. And sheepies!
Yeah.. and us!. But we can never leave.. Cody joked about saying we needed a wall.. He said it with a Donald Trump impression.
Is that heart applicable to now?. Or do you just fancy me at this moment?
Oh.... Not really.. I knew you couldn't be fancying me..
I don't know. Is there anything else I should know?
Oh... like what?
Goodnight. Tuck tuck
Happy Saturdat to you too
I'm alright. How are you?
That's really good.. More homework for you today?
That sounds like a fun game.. And sounds like a good day. I hope you have fun
I'm not sure. I haven't yet decided all of my plans
I suppose it is.
I have not hit up those places yet.
I don't have much UX design in my portfolio, and I don't really have that much experience in it either.
Is that so?
And portfolio? or do they find that in the resume?
Okay. I will check them out
At home?. Do you need me at that time?
Oh. I was excited for a bit there.
Wow! What for?. Oh, and I just thought you needed me to run an errand
Oh wow!. :3
Cool!. Me too
Hmm.. let me see!. Usually closer to Halloween.. Maybe even in November
I like spending time with you too!
Yeah?. What do you want to dress as?
Really?. I feel like that could be frowned upon
Sheik would be different. I can be your Link
Link could be cool. Did you want to do game characters?. We could do more Studio Ghibli costumes too, that's an option
Hmmmmmm. We could dress as The Cat Returns characters. Or there's Princess Mononoke. Or I could dress as Totoro, and you could be Mei. (Or Satsuki)
Okay!
For Link?
I don't have tights :P. That's true. I'm just the same every year
Link is cool. I'm a big fan of the series
Sounds like a plan@. !*. We can also get things from thrift stores
And cut those up
Fun!. I can't wait either!
I need to work on my nyeah sounds. And pot smashing skills
Really?
Smash Bros if you select Zelda. She's her own playable character on the Wii U
Gap is in Hawaii right now
Cassidy
I'm not sure of all of the details. I feel like a lot of wine drinking will be involved. Sheik appear in the Ocarina of Time. Appears*
I know!
No
He just teaches you some things
I say he, because you're not supposed to know it's a she when you meet her
I can try and find stuff for us?. That way we spend more time making than we do lookingm. .*. If you want. I would be happy to. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I
Of course. I would pick out the best that I can find. You could give me suggestions for what to look for?
For a bit, I think so
I can also study the costume
What?
That is crazy!. Silly school politics
No. But being politically correct or what people deam is correct will hinder opinions. Goodbye freedom of speech
Not really. It perpetuates segregation in a way. Though as a white person, many would say that I cannot have a say in the matter.. Hmm.... So it wasn't a conversation?
How did he word it?
That happened to me once..
Yeah... I suppose if you're inebriated then after reading a bad article about Black Lives Matter, then you could post what he posted
I rarely post for that reason
Scary place, the internet
Wow!
Of course!!!
Of course. Fabric paint, leather, and fabric!
Come out?
Maybe@. We can test on scrap fabric first
I glanced over iy. It*. I will view it better. Any revisions?
Hmm.. need athletic tape :P
Oh, yeah. Looks like bandages though
Green and more green :P
Maybe!
Whoa
There's red Link too. And rabbit Link
Oh! That's him starting out. Other gameplay shows him green
Whoa!!!!!. Me too. Sleep well! Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Rawr!!!!1
We'll figure it out!
Definitely. Masking tape will help us!
Masking tape is friend!
No... I just know
We gotta make chainmail :P
Yeah, that was recommended by the detailed post you sent before. Whoa... Ramen Night? That sounds super fun!
Hey!. That's awesome!!. Stalking has really paid off for you!. (just kidding). I hope you have a nice day today
I've been looking at costumes. I'm also looking at the AnimaterMentor things you sent, but I don't really know how to do it.
What's it for? I didn't even see a notification for it!
Oh, alright!
Oh! You're fine :P
Rawr to you!
Have you taken it?\
And signing up is required?
Okay. I finished. Gap told me about that. I think I mentioned it to you as well. Did anything bring it up for you to do it?. Did you want to compare?
10	Quality Time 8	Physical Touch 5	Acts of Service 4	Words of Affirmation 3	Receiving Gifts  What's yours?
I wasn't big on gift giving either.
I did have a few that I wasn't sure about.. I took it again and got:  11 Quality Time 6 Acts of Service 6 Physical Touch 5 Words of Affirmation 2 Receiving Gifts.. I suppose that's still more physical touch than you had.
Did it confirm your deepest fears?
I usually sided with Physical Touch when Acts of Service or Receiving Gifts was the other option, because I'd rather do the act of service and the gift giving than have you do those things.
Is that unconventional?
*hug*. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I just know you need to be up early in the morning
And I need to practice the macarena.. I mean the ocarina!!
I know the difference, but it's silly wordplay. Sounding similar n' whatnot. It doesn't look terribly hard, except for not having one.
It's important to the costume!
In one of my 20 inventory slots
Sweet dreams to you too! I love you too!
I miss you too
We will see one another soon. There's a Halloween costume party on the 29th at my Church. I'm sure UVa has plenty of cook things though!
Yes
It will be fun!. Will we go in costume?
Yum!
I'm good. How are you?
So cold!
:p
It's cold in my room :P. So I can tell already
Indeed
No?. What happened?
'3'
You.... !
I hope so!
Why does cheesecake have to be involved?. Are you thinking of it because you're eating some?
I liked your pun (:
Watching a few tutorials, Cutie!. What are you up to?
That's pretty cool!
Various props for the Link costume.
I've watched a few. The one right now is for the shield.
I think you do, for sure!
Wow! So cool!. I'm proud of you!
I applied to your favorite company :P
I love you too, Leandra!. Sweet dreams to you too!
Good morning!
Yup yup
Should I get a substitute for you?. I read that it's good to make the pattern out of scrap cloth to make sure it fits
No, I make the pattern out of paper, but I make sure it works in fabric before we use the good fabric. I suppose that would only matter if the fabric was really scarce.. We can always fix something that's too big, but not something too small. Could you give me your measurements?
There are a few things I can make for you though
Like the scarf thing?
I won't start painting, just template making. I can also get fabric if you know what tou need. You*
I've never seen it at Jo Ann's, but I wouldn't be surprised, but we may have to order it.. So if you know what you need, I might need to check so we can get things shipped on time if we order anything.
I will check it out.
Whoa!. What an unprompted message!
Really? Did you mean to send it to me?. Maybe you were talking to Twe?
Sweet dreams to you!!!. I look forward to seeing you too! Do you want suede leather?. For your costume?
Suede is leather leather, it's just not as smooth :P. I've been doing prep work for costumes. I have a lot of cardstock, by the way.. If you want leather leather, we can get it online. It's difficult to get large sheets in craft stores, and it will hold up better than fake leather. I already have the leather tools needed. I have punches, needles, and maybe even leather thread, but if not the thread, that's easy to find.
I will consider that.. I need leather for my costume too, so big pieces would be useful for both of us. I was looking at undyed deerskin.. Being able to dye it ourselves gives us more options.. And the ability to use the same pieces.
Oh, okay. There is colored vinyl at Jo Anns
Yes. There's also "pleather"
Options :P. Do you have an idea of what fabric you want? I can go to Jo Anns and get us started.
Alright, just checking!. https://www.alovestorygame.com/. Buy One Get One free at Chipotle.
Or both days!
Goodnight!
That's awesome!. I hope you have/had a safe trip!
I love you so much too!!! I can't wait either!!!!. I have a bunch of cardstock, so ready for you. Just need a place to work.. And fabric. I have an idea of what fabric I should use.
Do you have an idea?. We can brainstorm together.
Oh cool!. Can't wait!
Sweet dreams to you too!
I suppose so.. I guess it makes me feel bad that you think so poorly of me.. I mean, you're awake this late, and you don't even own minecraft.
It's equivalent to you.. I'm just looking at costume tutorials and compiling what I think are good ones.
I suppose it's equally as uneventful.. I was grading papers earlier though.
You grade as a TA, right?. So you know better than I.
I was grading maps. Which was rough because everyone labels things differently and no one knows where anything is.
And when they do, they'll use little indicators that have slight variations from one another, but they represent different unnamed locations.. Oh, lunch would be great!
I have a buy one get one free at Chipotle. I am open to other suggestions. We could go to Our Daily Bread like we planned before.
Okay! How does 11:45 sound?
Oh, okay.. I could pick up the food and bring it to you.
Okay. I'll see you there.
Goodnight.
Will you need a ride to Chipotle?
That's part of downtown where skateboarding isn't allowed. Be extra safe.. I was thinking I would walk down, so maybe I could walk with you while you skateboard back.. Or you could skateboard to my house, and I could take you home.
That's true.. I guess I should just drive down then.
That's the time we decided on.
I'm concerned about parking, so I'm going to walk down, walk home, and drive later
Will do. Here
I'm safe!
I love you too!. I hope I didn't spook your mother.. And hey! You're arms are supposed to be tucked!. By "spook" I mean she was in the restroom when I departed.. Good morning!
Hello!!. How did you sleep?
I slept well!. Did you want to work on costume things today?. Or do you have other work you need to do first?
Okay. You can always work on that work after.. When would you like to hang out?. I can help you with more pull ups
Oh... Okay. If we want to buy anything, a few stores will be closed by then.
The second time around has fabrics and clothes.. But it's not the best variety
Okay.
Sounds good.. I'll see you at 5. Unless I've done something and you don't want to see me?
Okay. Good luck! I forgot the paper at your house.
I should have more.
I have fabric markers, fabric spray paint, and I might only have white fabric paint paint
Cool! We should make the templates before we shop at Jo Anns. Just so we know how much fabric to get.. I suppose I have a few things to finish. I like working with you too.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&v=cILZ_cB3_so
It definitely is.. Are you nearly ready for template making/shopping?
Of course!. Leaving now!. Be there in a bit.. Safe and sound. I found the table, so we have a place to work! (:. It'll even be a good table for homework :D. You're welcome now.. Good morning! (:. It's okay if you don't come over. I won't start on anything you need without you though.. I hope you slept well!. If you do decide to come, you don't have to get ready! I want to see you as soon as I can.
Maybe!
You were too tucked in!. Don't be sad!!!. :(
Come over and get cozy here :D
You don't have to!. Do what you want though.. I'll just be waiting for you.
Okay. I understand.. I probably came off a bit too strong.. I was just excited to see you.. But I'll get to see you for Halloween. And for when I give you back your fabric.
I guess I shouldn't have assumed you wanted to see me too.
I set up a table for us to work. I have brushes and everything.
Oh, if you're busy, it's fine.
Have fun at Pandapas pond.
It sounds like fun, but I don't think I was invited.
No. It's fine. You can work on homework.. And play without me.
I did, but you seem busy and I'm just a little disappointed
I will probably distract you too much for you to take any breaks.
Me too..
I don't like doing stuff like that around you, because I take longer than you think I should.. I can work here. I have a workplace already set up.
I did. I guess I don't understand what would be wrong coming to my house.
Okay. That seems like a better answer than before.. I hope you enjoy
I think I'll work here for a bit.. You can let me know when you want to take a break though.. Or I can come over at 12:45
It's okay.. Wake up early enough for what?
There was still time. People didn't leave the house until 9:30
Except that we were going to make costumes.
Okay. There were still more reasons to come.
Right.
I need to get into a happier mindset before I can come over.
All those things would take time away from your schedule. Don't worry. I just need time
I don't have any.. It's an occasional job
No
Yes
I'm here
I drew this on your car. It won't be there in the morning to greet you though. I'm safe!
Oh hi!!
Yay! Did you find the heart on your car?
No problem! I hope Grace Hopper is fun! I know it's not for a few days, but you know..
Oh wow! And here I was thinking Wednesday!. My bad!. I hope your day is going well
Thanks!. Be safe tomorrow. Sleep tight!. Keep me updated (^. (: *. I love you!
Yay!
Sweet dreams to you!!. If only I could tuck you in!
How early?
Whoa... whoa.!. Slow down there!. Do you need a wake up call?
Okay!. If you say so :P
I hope you sleep tight too!
1st place: Hillary Clinton, 2nd: Gary Johnson, 3rd: Trump. https://blacksburg.craigslist.org/spo/5777335387.html. This one looks good!. Seems like a good price too.. Aw man. Already sold
I didn't leave it open D:
I can retake it for you
Awesome!. I hope you stay safe!
That is pretty cool!
I love you too!. Sweet dreams!. How's Houston?
That's great!
Lay it on me!. Whenever you have time, of course.. Which is likely rare, considering how packed your days are going to be.
Yeah!. I'm available whenever.. Except for a few minutes right now, as I'm going to get dinner.. But I'm back now
Two Door Cinema Club released a new album!
Sweet dreams to you!. Almost typed sweat there... that's not good
I love you! Can't wait to be the Tombo to your Kiki. The pixar stuff looks really cool!
Neat!. Thanks for keeping me updated!. Oh goodness.. That looks scary!
I bet!. Looks scary to me though
Which is scary
Was that the going away celebration? Or do you still have the weekend?
Oh! Now back to work. Chris Thile is on NPR
It's cool for sure!. He's making lots of jokes. And playing mandolin, of course. It just started, if you need something to listen to
It's really good!. It's being recorded, so you can likely watch it later!
That looks like a nice stay
Couches are the most comfortable furnature... I can book the airbnb
Cool. I will book it asap
Whoa.. other options? Like what?
Ooh! Cute!. And you can bring your guitar!!. Of those two, which do you prefer?
Not by a whole lot.
Hmm.... The cottage may be worth it. I will think about it.... If you don't want to pay the extra 16.33%, then the other is nice looking too. Looks similar to where we stayed last time.. I haven't checked if it is yet
Got it! Okay. Which days am I staying? Friday-Sunday?
Yeah, that would make sense!
Neato
Nothing at the moment
That's me.
What's wrong?
We just established that it's 11pm, so I'm not working on anything.
I'm watching a Quantum Leap rerun
It's a ghost episode
Too spooky. It's really just a murder mystery. But it turned into a ghost story at the end with a twist?? :o. Should I message the host before instant booking, or should I just book so that I get it before anyone elsr fors?. Else does*. I see that I can book and leave a message, but I'm not sure what I should include.
I've graduated! I need a new template :P. Don't worry. I'll take care of it.. I hope I haven't upset you.. Hello Sofie,  I am visiting my girlfriend during Halloween weekend and the cottage looks like a great fun place to stay. We are both quiet and respectful. We will likely be out and about for most of our stay, but the cottage looks very comfortable and we are excited to be greeted by your pets, even if one of them is mischevious.   Thank you!. This is what I have. Let me know if I forgot something, please.
Thanks. I will send it now unless you have anything else that needs to be added.
What about it?. Late check in and check out around 12 Sunday?
Sent. Hopefully you didn't think of any last minute revisions. Friday-Sunday for sure? I can visit Thursday too :P. But I can be a couch hobo then. Oh no. It's not letting me select a different payment method. I'll finish when I get home
Can I book with your saved payment and venmo you what I owe you?. Or p2p you?
Yes. 5481
Lli5ba is the email connected to airbnb, right?
Cool. All set
I'm looking forward to seeing you too!
It's been good. How about yours? Have a fun time at Grace Hopper?
That's awesome!. I liked the updates you gave me
It was nice!. I'm going to work on a few storyboards
Thanks. I'm determined to get some work done.. Is there anything you want me to do?
If you say so.. I miss you.... Oh goodness! :$
You're sweet!
We have the concert and your Halloween party to go to! If you have homework, then I can do homework too. Are there any places we can explore? Maybe a pumpkin patch? And we were going to eat donuts and ramen, right? :P. I'm also excited to cook, but I'm not sure what yet.. What did you want to do/eat?. There are two pumpkin patches, one kind of close and one far away, but I understand if you'd rather do something else. There is a woodworking demonstration. Might be cool to see a bowl or chair being made.
Good luck!
Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I was just thinking of asking. Of course I can.. Is there anything else you need me to bring you?
I was going to ask about frozen meals second!. Wow... it's like you get me or something.. If you think of anything more, don't hesitate to ask.
Sweet dreams, cutie pie!
Did you have a partner?. Oh, it's a skating move!. That's really cool!
Wow! When is your ice skating debut? I want to come see your show!
I will mark ny calendar!. My*. I hope you have a great day today.. Just so you know, you have 3 frozen meals left. I'll be at the grocery store tonight. Need me to get anything?
Sounds good, but today is discount day :P
I will find out!. Should I get your costume from your mother or should I drop by and pick it up while she's at work?. Asking because I don't want to bother your mother with the task of finding it
Okay! I sent a text, but calling would work better.. Do you know where it is in your room?
Thanks
Somewhere??!?
Gotcha. I will get your things tomorrow at 4pm. If you think of anything else, let me know.. Sleep tight. The yogurt wasn't on crazy sale, but it was on sale!. I got you some :P. Sleep tight
I lovr you. Love you*
Any time that works best for us. Sofie is going to leave the door unlocked
I mentioned 3pm
But she won't be around until 6pm, which is likely why she's leaving it unlocked.
Super cool!. Is the messenger bag with you in Charlottesville?. I'm not seeing it here.
Oh, good! I searched all over :P. I have everything else though. And a little extra something something
Want anything from Oasis?. Katy is making miso soup, so we came here for ingredients
Eep!
Goodnight!. Sleep well
Have you thought of anything else that I could bring you?
Okay. Got it. I'll see you Friday then. What time should I arrive?
We got ingredients for miso soup, but she hasn't made it yet. I can get it for you. Where is it?. Get the snorkeling gear*
If you give me an idea where they could be I can find them!
Do you want scuba boots?. I found black h&m pants in a nationals baseball bag. I hope those are the ones. And I found 3 tights. Will this be everything? Let me know! I can always come back. There isn't a paper kroger bag in your room that has pants. You left some sportswear here that you wear often. Do you want those?
Yes. And it's okay I grabbed the sportswear?
Awesome!. Anything else before it's too late?
Okay! I'll probably leave around 8-10, but I will let you know before I do.
Of course!. When is the costume party?
Which day?. Friday or Monday?. I'm excited to see you
Wow! That's where you want to be!
That's awesome!. I guess you have to wait to hear from Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. Unless you know you want to go for sure.
Good luck. Any last minute things for me to bring?
You sure? It can be any thing!
Okay. Well I plan to leave around 8-10
I will refine the time in the morning.
Oh. Okay. So I should arrive at 1 and pick you up from your meeting
Or would you rather I arrive at 10 ir 11?. Where is your meeting? I need to know if I want to pick you up. You never told me when the party was.. Also, what is the attire for tomorrow?. Dress code*. Sweet dreams.. Sorry for so many text walls... I'm curious why you're not saying much. I fear I may have upset you or something
But I should wear my costume?
A playground?
Very
I love you too!!!!1!!111!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Where should I pick you up?
Coming at 11
Cool. Be there in 10. Here
I just made it home! Thanks for inviting me!!!
I'm glad you were comfy!
I'm not sure! When are you free. ?*. I can visit whenever you like, or I will see you over Thanksgiving Break
Okay! Then that's when we will meet again.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I love you!
:3
I hope you have a fantastic day too! I've got some ideas that should finish up the Bear and Bear pilot. Cody has agreed to voice act, and while I would like you to as well, I know you're busy, so Molly has agreed to as well.. I'll get to recording and I will storyboard at the same time, so hopefully I'll get it done soon
I've asked you before!. You definitely get your say, so would you like to voice act for me?. I haven't told anyone who they will play, so it shouldn't be an issue.. Let me know what you think of the pilot. It's a bit rough around the edges so far.. Let me know if you approve!. I have to get back to scraping paint :P. I snuck in a bit ago to finish it up.. Don't tell anyone.. It's an amalgamation of several bits and pieces that I've written along with some new stuff.. I only refrained from asking you because I know your schedule doesn't give you a lot of time for things and I need to get it presentable soonish.
Thanks!. I hope your day has been nice! I love you (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
yes.
Any other details?
Vaguely.
Isn't social media a given?
Oh. I wasn't picturing them next to each other.
So it could be a facebook chat where it says seen 11:45am?
Or what if the government retweets the post?
There are groups on twitter. I'm not seeing how the significancr can be portrayed with just a twitter/facebook logo. significance*. Am I close to what you're looking for?
Why is it better?. The second is to remind me you only want one text bubble?
Why do they need social media if they are with each other?
I may be confused as to what the boundery object means
That doesn't necessarily help
From the protestors side?
You're welcome.. I only know of twitter and facebook for things :P. What kind of style are you looking for?. And what should the govt and protestors look like?
Like squares?
So citizens and government labels if gender/racr neutral?
I saw the message. I just don't want to do something offensive.
Xkcd style illustration? Or something cute?
The hat and badges are on military officials.
Okay. I will get on it in the morning, if that's okay.
That's fine!. Whatever you feel is fair.
No problem! I will try to get it done as soon as possible. I'm going to wake up early and start. Should go by quickly since I have the drawing already. Do you think the govt officials would be more likely to use a laptop and the protestors a phone?
Got it!. I will try to have it to you soon. Hopefully well before 1pm. I will make it a png so that it has a transparent background.
Or would you like a gif where it slightly moves?
Neat. I would just make it look like things were shaky :P
Okay.. I mean. I could have the social media bubbles pop up from the computer one at a time.. That might be interesting to see.. If you have time... let me know what you think of the script and the characters.
So it would play once and be a static image.. Got it.
Good morning!
This is for my reference* :P
What contrast? That it's government and citizens?
One will have suits :P
Oh no! I'm running out of time!. I just sent a temporary one where I believe it is close to finished, but not completely.
Yeah, It's just if I don't get it to you on time.. By less symmetry, do you mean they should be different colors?
Sent a new one.. Hopefully it will do!
There. The most recent one I sent you has a slight gradient on it because I wanted the highlight from the laptop and phone to show up. Please use it if you can.. Sorry for being late. You can deduct my pay.
I'm glad you think so!. There's a vs sale going on.
5 for $27. I thought you should know.. I would purchase stuff for you myself, but you said not to.
Any time!. I'm glad you liked it.. And I'm glad I could meet your needs.
Cody had the same problem.. Thanks!
I should have sent a pdf to begin with :P
Yeah? Cool. Did you want to voice Lily?
Or are there any concerns you have?. That's the Lily I mean.
That's fine!. Cool (:. I was going to rig up a recording system, but you may have access to better equipment than I.. How big are your feet?. On an unrelated note.
Thanks!. I know your shoe size.
Oh!. Xeroshoe has a diy kit :P
Ah... I'll look into it.. I hope you had a nice day today!. You might be a size 8 for the shoes.. A 7 being 5mm too small, and an 8 3mm too big.. What about the Umara Z-trail?
Okay!. Goodnight for now (:
Sleep tight. Let me know when you can do voice recordings
I would prefer okay quality.
Thank you.. I might need to read it with you in later runs
Yep yep
Oh no! Cody wanted the Indians to win!
It's super cool! But poor Cody.... He's okay with it!. I hope you had a nice day today.. I can't wait to see you.
Thanks!. Are you feeling any better?. Still have the sore throat?. I want to talk, but I can wait until you're not busy.. Goodnight!. Sleep tight
That's great!. I miss you bunches. Sorry if you don't feel similarly.
Makes sense.. Can I still count on you for voice work?
As soon as possible. I need it for me demo.. my* demo
I suppose I can always replace the low quality recording later.
I know. I was hoping to get voice work while I storyboard so that I can put them together around the same time.. I've got rough sketches right now. Nothing really boarded.
I think I can start storyboards tomorrow as long as I know that the characters look the way I want them to.
Thank you (:. I'm excited to try that skateboard.
I was going to go out today, but it's been a bit rainy.. Goodnight and sleep well.
I'm feeling okay. How are you feeling?
I'll end up cutting them anyway.. I think mp3 is a good format?. or avi. Wait... I'm reading that it might be best not to use mp3, and wav or aiff would be best.
Oh. You can use mp3, it's just not as universal as wav and aiff are.. And I'm thinking about the future.
Using mp3 just means that there could be complications with compression, but it shouldn't be a huge problem with how rough it will be.. Thank you!
Maybe "Lily pg 1 'first few words'". Or numerically. Whichever is easiest. I'll figure out a system in the future.. In fact, you can do numerically, and I can rename them.
Neat! Thanks for doing this!
Oh, okay.. No thank you!. just kidding :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams
*tuck* *tuck*
*puts toe spacers in*. :P
*fluffs pillow*. *forehead kiss*. *curls up in ball*
Rawr!
Happy Saturday. Have a great day. Boop. I can't help but feel like you're having these really cool conversations with people, and I'm just missing out.
Cool! Parent weekend. I remember.. I just made a drawing thing for Molly.. It's not a style I normally do, but I wanted you to see it.
Goodnight. Sleep well.
*tuck* * tuck*
Any time!. Don't forget tl reset your clocks!. To*
That's great! Or you can wake up even earlier!. Have a nice day today.
I'm alright. I've been sketching and we just finished church. How are you doing today?
A few random human poses as well as a few Wizard of Oz things
I've decided to rework the cover, and I think I'm getting closem. Close.*. How are you doing today? What are you up to?
Sounds awesome!. Eat at any new or delicious restaurants?
Yum!!!. Sounds great!. If you need a rubber duck, I'm your guy!
No problem!. I hope you had a nice day. We're not talking much, I hope everything is okay.
I meant with you and me?
Okay then. I love you. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Goodnight and sweet dreams
I hope all of your projects and papers are going well!
Don't worry about me. I'm keeping busy. Though I still want to talk to you a bunch.
Goodnight! I love you, Leandra!
That's me!
Going now
Thanks!. I'm a voter now. Thank you for the voice recordings! I haven't had the chance to listen yet, but I really appreciate it.
Oh wow!. Did I write in a sneeze?. How should I pay you for your services?
Wow! Thanks for planning ahead! (:
Wow!. I can barter!. Like... food?. I would say hugs, but that not be worth it to you.
That's also why I wouldn't offer hugs, because you should already expect them
I just saw a girl skateboarding! Just thought you should know.
Did I see you??. No.... Must be prime female skateboarding hour.. Just kidding. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I hope you had a nice day!
Thanks. Sleep tight.
It's nice hearing your voice (:. I have lots of free time if you ever want to chat and tell me how ice skating or skateboarding have been going. Let me know if you've mastered the ollie!. Oh, and you had a breakdancing show too? I'm not sure if you participated, but I'd like to hear about it.. I'd also like to hear about school things.. like that paper you had.
That's okay. Let me know if you do dance in one. I'd like to see it.
Any other updates?
I understand if you're busy and you don't have time to talk.. I sometimes feel like you don't want to talk any more.. Or maybe you just stopped liking me in general.. I understand you're busy, but it's hard to imagine being too busy for your significant other.
Are you going to address any other concerns, or are those accurate?
So maybe you'd rather be with someone who can give you conversation?
What do I give you then?
Yeah, I just wasn't sure if you would respond.. Better company gives good conversations.
I can always give input in your thoughts if you want to have a conversation.
If you have something on your mind that you want to talk about, I can help.. I think you want me to start conversations, but I don't know what you want to talk about.. If there are things you want me to do better, let me know those too
What a cool guy!. I remember this episode :P
Oh?. Is it a comic book or a book book?
And it's called What If?
Go ahead!
Whoa!!!!. What a turn of events!. Sounds like a book to check out!. Oh! Off topic, but how is the song writing coming along?
Cool!
Probably not.. But that happens!. There's an app that detects the song and tells you what it is. If it sounds similar it might be picked up.. I think it works with humming a melody.. As for lyrics, you might just have to google them to see if they are similar to anything.
I've been thinking about songwriting too, but for Bear and Bear. I know it's not the most important thing to work on, but intros are what grab the initial audience.. Not sure if the app is free. I think it is.
On a few illustrations. I took a while on a few of them, which bothered me, but I think the outcome was decent.. I practiced skateboarding! I fell a few times, but fortunately I caught myself. I also managed to do a 180 degree turn.. I tried to do it a second time.. which is one of the many reasons I fell :P. Raked leaves into piles and tested the jumping into ability of said piles.. What about you?
Tick tack
Nothing special. That stuff is special! My skateboarding was nothing special.
Is that what it is. ?*
Wow!. It was cool when I did it, but I couldn't do it a second time.. The grip tape is so grippy!
I couldn't get my feet off with confidence :P. But it's a good thing.. I'm hoping I can get as good as you so we can skate together.
Definitely! I'll try to get a helmet!. Maybe some pads.. It'll be cool. I really appreciate the voice acting. I'm still waiting on the other actors. Not that I shouldn't be working on the storyboards, of course, because I should be.. Anywah, thanks for chatting. Good luck with everything, and if you're going to sleep, goodnight and sweet dreams!
So sleep? Cool! Sleep tight!
I will try to! Though I may ask for new recordings in the future.
Awesome!
I found What If, but I haven't read a lot of it yet, mostly because I can't get the pages to load. I continued work on my Wizard of Oz book cover, but right now I'm watching cartoon minisodes.. I like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY6kfVWv01k. The main character is voiced by Ashley Johnson, who voiced Terra in Teen Titans.
Definitely. I would recommend it if you have time.. It has cute corgis. It's not the best pilot I've ever seen, but it sets up for a good story and I think the premise is pretty interesting. Though, I fear that it wouldn't last for very long. I think it would work well as a mini-series or for maybe a season or two.
The main characters name is "Tulip" which made me feel a bit disheartened with Bear and Bear.
I suppose!. And oh no! Trump D:. The results look a bit concerning right now.
Definitely!
Indeed.
They might try to impeach him!. Or worse...
Sweet dreams to you! *wiggles toe spacers into toes* *fluffs pillow* *tucks in* *tuck* *tuck* *kisses forehead* *turns the lights off*. Phew. I hope you wake up to a better tomorrow.
Certainly scary!. I'm sorry you didn't wake up to a better tomorrow :(
Perhaps. I'm a bit worried for everyone.
I think global warming is a naturally occuring event, however, humans have accelerated it though, which is going to cause problems.. There are extra words in there, my bad.
I don't think we can fix it, but we can probably reduce our impact so that it isn't as catastrophic.. Or so the effects won't be as detrimental to our survival. What do you think?
Definitely!
That's scary.. We definitely need better and more sustainable foods.. The solar panel roofing Elon Musk came out with seems really cool. Definitely a way to reduce our energy consumption.
https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/these-are-teslas-stunning-new-solar-roof-tiles-for-homes/
It's true, but it's a step in the right direction. I think Elon Musk plans to make it more consumer friendly.. It's different from normal solar panels, but you're correct, it isn't cheap.. But neither is a conventional metal roof. And asphalt is cheap, but has to be replaced fairly often.
Definitely. The project is in its infancy.
True.. Everyone just needs their own personal garden too.. Food garden*. Having smaller homes would help by reducing power usage and whatnot
I have found many closed groups that are for schools and projects alike
Definitely cool! Not what Pixar is looking for.
It's motion graphics mostly. Which showcases their animation abilities, but not their storytelling abilities.
It's true. Thanks! I'll join 'em regardless, because of the relevance.
True!
There are, I've seen a few.. Mostly forums or online magazines.
Not what I was referring to, but I'm sure there's a subreddit
That would be cool. I just gotta apply to that school and get a valid email address!
I didn't want to admit this, but I'm a bit sick, so I will mostly be resting.. What are you doing today?
Laying down and reading.. I haven't been able to sleep much.
For the most part.. I might have had some Halloween snickers though o.o. Thank you!. I've been on a few jogs too and I even have practiced my handstands
Yeah! I still won't be as buff as you, but I can try to keep up
It'll be great for you!. I'm happy you'll be happy (:
It has the foam pit!!!. You can practice you back/front flips!!!. Your*
Definitely! You could get pretty tired pretty quickly though. It's more strenuous than it appears. Not saying you will, I just know from what people say.
Of course! But that's pretty easy :P. It definitely looks like fun!. I've always wanted to go to one.. It'd be like ninja warrior
For a person or for America?
I'm worried that hate will come from either side, but I hope no one with hate joins in
Please be safe! (:
I'm going to try to exercise some today. Hopefully that will make me feel better!. How was the vigil?. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I hope you had a nice day today. What did you do?. I hope it was good... whatever it was.
Sorry to hear that!. A project meeting? Anything to do with the excel thing I helped with?
Oh, which one?
Not really.
What are your thoughts?
Hate comes from both sides unfortunately. People that voted with Trump do not necessarily align their views with him, they likely saw a problem and thought that voting for Trump was the best option for change, even if that change could have detrimental effects.. I don't believe that Trump was the best outcome from the election, but I don't think he will have the power to see most things through, and I don't think he will be able to change the progress the civil rights activists have fought for.
Oh okay. I was going to add that I'm worried for both sides. One side will think hate is okay because the leader does, but the other side will think hate is the appropriate response.. Please don't be sad!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I've seen a lot of hate on facebook especially towards people who voted for third parties.
Maybe, but all of those people voted for Hillary, and I've seen it online as well.
This outcome is the same as the one if Hillary won the election.
Except the fear is coming from Democrats.
I know, but fear still would have come from those who voted for Trump.
I understand.
I feel like hate would have won either way.
Because both sides harbor their own hate. I'm not saying that Trump was the better of the two, but hatred was an outcome we were going to end up with no matter what.
Condemning hate speech controls what people say, which isn't a good thing. Hate speech isn't good, but we shouldn't control it.. And it's not the same outcome, I just think hate would have been a result no matter who won.
I agree. Having productive dialogues is very important.. However, I've noticed that for some there is only one correct way of thinking. If you disagree you could be labeled a racist without the chance to defend your position.
People need to be more willing to partake in discussion. I think people are too eager to attack someone for disagreeing with their opinion.. And that's the problem. A loud minority of Democrats cannot have a respectful disagreement and neither can a loud minority of Republicans.
Goodnight.. I don't know what the solution could be. I just know that a lot of people are rational, intelligent and they voted for opposing parties.. And I wish that they could have civil discussions, but it's hard to change people.. Sleep tight.
Are you telling me to go?
Okay!. I'm still a bit sick, but I suppose I'm getting better.
I had a runny nose too.. and my body was sore, but it's not sore anymore.
Won't that make me sick again?
I'll do it
The flu shot and YHacks
I'll try!. Did you have an email for Chris?
What do they want me to email and which bus is it?
Should I use tean@yhack.org?. Team*
Cool. All taken care of.. I'll save you a spot on the bus.. Unless I'm not feeling great... I understand if you don't want to sit next to a dead body.
Oh, you wouldn't team up with me?. And other people?
I'd like to be part of something, but if you would rather I not be apart of your team, that's fine.
Okay.. I thought you brought YHack up because you wanted to see me... And wanted me on your team.. I guess I understand that I don't bring much to the table as much as a coder does.. To clarify, I thought when you sent me the info, it was an invitation to be part of your team.
But you still don't want me to be a part of your team.
I suppose I am.. I guess I won't be spending much time with you then.. I can still make the logo for you though, even if I'm in a different team.. It. 's* always nice to eat foods with you, but maybe I'll run into you some time.
I'm not so sure about that.
It's up to you too
On facebook? I haven't gotten a reply from Chris yet.
You got the $80 from venmo, right. ?*
Good. Just checking.. Any other payments you need me to make?
I'll join the group. I don't know which one though.. https://www.facebook.com/groups/518711368323943/ ?. Thanks for adding me!
Will do. I'll see you tomorrow!. Or maybe not
I'm all confirmed to go.. Chris accepted me and I filled out the forms
Thanks!
Okay. Sure thing. Is the bus going to be at the usual location?
Can you forward it to gmail?
What do you mean?. Forward the information to gmail. Not the bus
It just appeared, thanks!. It has the bus location, thanks!
I'm thinking one change of clothes because of space, but I want more because of hygiene. Is there anything else you need me to bring you?. My backup is only at 5.08gb :(
Okay... if you say so.. I could always pick up your memory foam pillow
Alrighty then. Oh! 5.09gb!. Want me to bring or buy any snacks?
I can share.. Why don't you want to share with me any more?
It'll be easy for me either way. I won't make any sandwiches for you though
December 8th. What happened???. Are you okay?
Whimpered? Do you need me to bring an ankle brace?
That's good at least. I'll look for one, and if I can't find one, I'll make a trip to kroger.. Good that you didn't whimper, not that it's the most pain.
Where are you? Are you safe?
RICE
Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevate
You should do that as quickly as possible to initiate healing.
Elastic wrap, or ankle support.. It pushes swelling away from the anklr. Ankle*
You may need a moderate ankle brace.. They do help.. Mild or Light Weight Ankle Braces are for those who have experienced a First Degree Sprain or mild strain.. Moderate or Medium Support Ankle Braces are for those who have experienced a Second Degree Sprain and are more active in sports with lateral or side to side movements. Moderate supports can also be used as a preventative brace to help avoid injuries.. You don't need a maximum brace since it still hurts.. If you are using your ankle brace as a rehabilitative or treatment device you should wear your brace while performing any daily activities to provide more stability and prevent re-injury.. Are you positive it is a second degree sprain? I guess it's the most common, but I need to know to get the most appropriate ankle brace.
When you sleep, put a pillow or two under your foot.
3 means you don't feel it.
Third degree requires medical attention.
Third Degree Sprain - This injury is much less common and usually requires medical attention. This sprain is usually total rupture of a ligament. The symptoms are intense swelling, extreme loss of motion and intense. The healing time is usually 12 weeks to 1 year and can become a chronic condition depending on the way the ligament is repaired or the way it heals.. I really hope it's not that one.
Second Degree Sprain - This is the most common type of sprain and includes mild partial ligament tears with swelling and stiffness in the joint. This sprain will inhibit weight bearing or use of the joint. Symptoms can include intense swelling, moderate pain and moderate loss of motion or use of the joint. Walking can be difficult. Normal activities can return within 2 to 4 weeks of the injury.
I saw that too.. You neer medical attention if it's 3rd degree. Need*
And you probably can't go before the bus arrives.
I will check on crutches, no promises though. I will go buy a moderate ankle brace.
Extra life
I'll check on two. Maybe a cane?. :P. We have this, believe it or not.. It should work.. Not a tall crutch, but it's still good.. Need any snacks while I'm out. ?*. Please talk to me (:
Yes. It's kind of noisy, but it works well.
Okay. Moderate ankle brace then?. Those are preventative braces, so you could use it even when your ankle is fine.
Would you like 2?. :p. Do you need any first aid wraps?. Preference for ibuprofen?
Preference for the ankle brace?. There are some with reinforced sides. Thoughts on wraps?
The wrap adheres to itself. I'll get the reinforced ankle brace. A little more expensive, but you can just pay me back the price for the less expensive one. I will get the wrap just in case.
Do you prefer liquid gel ibuprofen?
Not a boot
It doesn't. The ace is more expensive actually. It was just in the wrong spot. But it has better reviews so I'll get  it!. Is your ankle doing any better?
If you need any kisses to make it feel better...
Sleep tight
See you!. I love you
I hope you feel a little better.. I have everything for you. I'm the only one on the bus o.o. I don't believe there is wifi on the bus, so be sure to load any pages you may need.. There were supposed to be 10 people. I wonder why they didn't show up.
What do you mean?. I don't see any outlets.
Not in the one I'm sitting in.
I'm not sitting up there though. I can move.
Positive, but I can ask.
No wifi. Just asked.. But he has a box to charge things up front.
I was expecting more people, so I sat in a comfortable middle seat.
The way he answered my question implys that we can use it, but it's limited by the number of outlets.. Implies*
Do you want to sit with me on the bus?. And if so, where would you like to sit?
So I should sit up front?
Were you answering my questions? Or were you just excited?
Okay. I will move.
You can sleep on the bus because eye madk. Mask*. Also it's a 10 hour ride.. I sat up front with the charging box. We will become good friends.
We're running a bit late because we were waiting on people that never showed.. Don't worry, I have the ankle brace and crutch for you!. We are at mile marker 216
I hope the same
We're in Charlottesville. So not long now.
3 minutes
The bus driver has a different address.. Good thing I'm here to direct him to you guys.
Newcomb. But we're going to rice. I was napping, so I didn't catch it earlier
There have been complications. :/. I feel sad. It's like you don't want to spend time with me any more.. Okay
Wow, you showered? So fresh!. Really know how to treat yourself at hackathons.. I think there are raisin/craisin bagels if you are uninterested in muffins and donuts (if donuts are even there)
I wish you wanted me around.
Jenny took the leftover $20. I would have been happy to take your call, I'm sorry I missed out.. I just made it home.. Jenny was going to send the excess back.. I hope you're sleeping well
Thanks. I slept well. I hope you have a good day
It was nice to see you too
Any time.
Oh, is it raining?. I'm glad it could be useful!. Wow. Rain all day!. Be safe
That's good. I hope it goes well!. Hopefully you don't need a crutch.
No worries. My gift to you.
$100
Oh, ask Jenny for that.. She took the $20. You'll just need to make sure she hasn't paid Chris back
Anything else?. That you need?*
Okay, that's good. Have a great day. Are you keeping your ankle wrapped?. Or braced?
Don't forget. You can wear it while you breakdance even when you're better.
Awesome. When is your appointment?
Oh, that's what you meant by good results... what were they?. Details?
Do you have the appropriate brace. ?*
It's probably fine... :P. It could be a problem if it were for a level 3 sprain.. Possibly.. I'm glad that you'll be better soon. Maybe in time for Toronto.
That's great
That's where you want to go, right
?*
Ah. I was saying "right?"
So that's the place?. I'm assuming you want to ice skate while you're there, so I'll try to schedule that for you. I'll try to make the schedule to your liking. If there are any other specifics you want to do, let me know.
If you don't think of anything, I'll do my best planning.. How was your day today?. What did you do?. I hope it was good.. Sorry.. I forgot you needed the logo done. Was it today? I'll try to get it done soon. Hayao Miyazaki is coming out of retirement to direct "Boro the Caterpillar". Originially it was just going to be a short film where he was exploring 3D animation, but he recently decided that that wouldn't do the film justice.
I know. Pretty exciting. I'm assuming you're catching up with homework, so good luck. Goodnight if you're going to sleep.. And if you're not doing either of those things, then I hope you have fun.. You don't talk to me much any more, and that makes me sad, but if it's not something you want to or like to do, then so be it.
That's an impressive app there
Do you collect faces now?
I'm not familiar. But cool.
That's great!
I suppose I was pretty tired, because I slept for a while. I worked on a few drawings though. I still need to know when you need the logo for Sol Tower
Oh no. I'm sorry
So tomorrow? I can do the variations as well so that you can vote.
Okay. I'll see what I can do.
The items were fairly inexpensive and I'm glad to have helped, so no worries.
No problem!. I just wish the crutch had been more useful.
I'm glad too!
Sweet dreams to you too. I would tuck you in, but I'm 2 and a half hours away.
I love you too. Too bad we don't share a moon.
I will see
If you want
Modea may consider me more if I include my hackathon experience.
That makes sense.. They used to include who worked there, but I'm not seeing anything yet
steve.grant@modea.com is the most relevant email I can find, but it's from 2016
They don't list a contact for modea on the website.
They don't have those contacts available.
I don't think they work there any more.
No. I can try to find it.
I think Kelly Showalter had the contact information, and I just showed up.
Training isn't ideal there from two employee reviews.. I likely would have lost a business card within 5-6 years.
No
Is it related to Modea? I might have found it.. It's a spin-off company at Modea.
I sent an email requesting contact information.. It may take a bit.
Adam Soccolich looks like the guy to email.
It says he's part of recruiting
Sarah Anderson assists with recruiting
I think there's a different process once you're out of school. sarah.anderson@modea.com is a valid email address.
Yep.. Is the subject a job application? Or how should I go about it?
So just "job application"?
Experience Application?. Application to Come Aboard/Job Shadow?
I suppose. Feels a lot like an application.. Adam Soccolich contacted me back about my contact for Modea.. If I reply back, then it already has a subject.
Oh no... you're right.. Now it will look like spam
I guess so.... Too bad I already sent the email.. Other wise I could just give up.. I was just kidding.. I thought you were too.
Just making sure
Sweet dreams to you!
It's a bit late to register, don't you think?
Let me see. Deadline has passed
I suppose.. but I wouldn't be registered
nIce. Going would be cool. Hopefully they still have cat shirts
Ran a few errands, got gas n' whatnot. I drew a bunch.
More wizard of Oz illustrations.
Very likely.
Thanks. What did you do yesterday?. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha-3MiVa7-Y
Sounds nice. What resurfaced? That video?
It's a good one.. I thought you would find it cute. I suppose you already have.
I've shown you cute kids doing cute things before, but I don't think I showed you that.. Maybe I did though
Thanks!. Needs more trees and an outline, then I can paint it.. But it's hard to focuse on a single thing for a long period of time.
I mean, I plan to do something else to relax my brain.. Like the logo for Sol Tower.. Or something.
Maybe that sounds odd to you.. Are you excited for hackduke?. That looks pretty excited!. What foods are you most excited for this Thanksgiving?
Goodie!. What else?
Sweet Potato Casserole!. Sometimes it has lil' marshmallows.. Would you want lil' marshmallows?. I would have said I was looking forward to sweet potato casserole, so there we go.. Anyway.. goodnight and sleep well.. I'm working on the other ones, but I thought you would like to see the sun one.
Not even a lil' marshmallow?. Homemade marshmallows, maybe?. Lil' pillow marshmallows?!?. whipped cream?. Goodnight
They. 're cute*
And a staple of sweet potato casserole.. But I suppose it's not necessary.. Also-- they are cute and yummy... :P. But not necessary, so I won't include them
I couldn't get yoga.. This is neat!
How's it going?. (That's me waving, but I'm not as fluffy). (I know you're answer is probably "it's going well" or "I'm good, but busy", but I'd still like to hear about your day)
I'm also not as cute as the puppy, but hopefully you'll ignore that too. I have finished the drawing, but I haven't painted it yet and I'm still tinkering with the logo. I'm having trouble with it though.. I've shown you that puppy before too.
Just has more trees and edited trees.. And some grass and stones.. just random things.
Yes.
Yeah, I think it looks good. I'm just hoping I don't mess up when I outline/paint it.. I'm also making progress with the logo. Nothing to show that isn't a pencil sketch, but I think I can give you something soon. You also needed a gif of some sort?
Which would have the logo do something?
I'll see what I can do!. Maybe the cannon can shoot at the player and it crashes the screen?
Will do. I'll see how quickly I can do all of the things.
I heard back from Modea. They are not currently looking for a graphic designer.. And everywhere else has left me in the dark.
A place called Moshi, BE, LightStream, and dex media. I'm looking at a few gardens, zoos, walking paths, and whatnot in Toronto.. Oh, and Chinatown.
Anything that you're super interested in?. Sorry if you're disappointed in me.
Oh yeah, looking at the islands.. And the bluffs. Do you want me to find you Airbnb listings too?
It would probably help you out since you're busy.. How do you plan to get to Toronto?. I want to help out.
Okay. So a place with parking will probably be best.. Or near a parking garage.. Are you going with anyone?. I just need to know so I can find listings that accommodate for 1 or more people.. What do you think?. Not sure what to do about the animation yet.
You didn't see this one as a sketch.
I'm planning for you, but were there people you intended to go with?. As far as a sketch goes, do you think it looks better when it's more "hand drawn" and less technical?
I mean, more sketchy, but filled in?
Are you planning to go to Toronto alone?. You'll have to wait for an example.
I didn't think you wanted to go with me. I'm also worried I wouldn't be able to afford the trip.. I didn't get to the "Sol" part because it's hard :P
This is hand drawn. It's not as clean as the alternative.
What color scheme would you prefer?. Grey is common for towers and yellow is common for suns.. And red is common for bricks.. So that's how I came to those colors.
Thanks for thinking so.. I can do more based on input.. Maybe if your team decides on a logo, I can make the animation.. And if they preferred a drawn logo, I can finish one of those. Or if they make a sketch of something, I can vectorize it.. Anyway, goodnight
I hope you sleep well too! *tuck* *tuck*
I hope you have the best day too. Have a nice time at Duke.. Unless you don't go?
Have a safe trip then
What an odd time to leave on a Friday
That's what I meant!
No
No special plans. I suppose I'll just be working on my drawings.
And Bear and Bear characters and doodles.
It's going slowly.
Only a few storyboards.
Oh goodness!. That's too much cute and awesome. I hope you enjoy yourself. What kind of hack are you doing?. You should do the drawing contest for fun
Why the sad face?
I'm sorry
I can make your logo so it'll be like I'm there, but I'm gone to the snack table.. At the moment...
I'd be happy to design it, regardless.
It's been okay.. Enjoy the puppies
Yep
Chatted with Cody a bit. He's going to try to do the voice recording soon. I've been reworking my character designs.. I'm not 100% on board with how they look now.
I'll see then. I need something that's easy to animate and appealing.
The design of the cute little polar bear.. What's wrong?
How do I fill the pot?. I can crawl inside it!
Can do. How's the progress going for the app? Have any stumbling blocks?
I wish I could help. Do you have a team?
I could be your secret team mate
Sure. What do you need?
A car under a magnifying glass. :P
I'll see what those look like.
What colors would you like me to use?. I don't need to include the highlight parts.
I will give you black then.. I've had soylent before! It tastes like liquid bread!
White just in case
Just black?. How do I differentiate color?. I recycled the only bottle I had.
Do you want the highlight or a gradient?
:P. You said the background will be chrome colored, so I'm going to include a black/blue icon
Sent. Plenty of options to choose from.. What will you doodle on your soylent?. I was thinking "It's made of people!". And have someone look paranoid.
Soylent green is people. It's a movie reference.
It's not obscure...
It's supposed to be funny.. Soylent Green is definitely a pop culture reference that has been referenced by many tv shows, movies, and comics. The movie itself may be obscure, as in people haven't seen it, but people have definitely heard that famous quote.
This is from the wikipedia article about the product: Soylent is named after a food in Harry Harrison's 1966 science fiction novel Make Room! Make Room!. In the novel, most types of soylent are made from soya and lentils. The word is, however, most commonly associated with the novel's 1973 film adaptation Soylent Green, in which the eponymous food supplement is made from human remains.. I feel like it's more common than you think.
I was just about to say... :P
I suppose the younger generation isn't up to date with 1970 pop culture.. Them youngin's
I'm clearly an old man.
Isn't it obvious? I'm like.. 22. Super old.. That's just me making a joke that isn't going very well.. It doesn't help that it's not funny either.
That's exciting!. What is it?. That looks great!!
I'm not surprised!
I'm okay. My family and I are having brisket tonight.
Definitely. I'm pretty excited for it.
It takes a while to cook, but it's not really tough.
I didn't know that the trip was for me... I can still plan it, I'm still looking at the various sights.
Because I'm slightly out of reach?. And because you're a potato?
Well you look cute!
What do you mean?. I'm right there, you just gotta scooch a bit. How goes hacking? You disappeared for a bit, I hope you didn't go find a new cupcake.. I guess it's okay if you got a new cupcake.. if that's what you wanted.. Wong Fu and Over the Garden Wall!!!?. That's awesome!
Yeah, you.
That's always fun!. Did you use glow in the dark frisbees? And maybe glow stick bracelets?
Just as good!. Maybe cooler... Actually.. definitely cooler. Cool! Sounds like quite the time.
I can, if you like!. I will, even if you don't like.. Good luck with everything. I'll be here if you need anything.
I gotchu. Just kidding... I don't mean to sound silly like that.
How goes the sleepless journey?
I'm still there with you.. You got this
Eep!. Don't give up yet!. Just kidding.. Do you need a wake up call?
Impressive!
Do you need me to call you in 20 minutes?
Oh, okay. Would you need me to wake you up later?. I know you can do it on your own, but I'm here if you want me.
I missed out on most of it, but the scraps were good!. I'm hanging with you though!
And I'm on this journey, except with less code.. It's like a parallel path that contains a similar journey, but one has coding in it.
It did have Cody until recently when he went to sleep. And there are a lot of snacks...
Yeah! Yogurt, peanut butter, an apple, and cookies! :P
When does the nap commense?
Okay! Sleep tight!. Too bad you don't have someone who converts into a pillow there.. Though, I'm sure they're easy to find...
Oh yeah.. pillows are good pillows.. I almost forgot.. How did the hacking go? I'm sorry for falling asleep.
Awesome! Did you finish most of the app?
Nice!. Are you on your way back to Charlottesville?
Oh! Fun!. What does the shirt look like this year?
Yeah? Awesome!. You'll have to show it off some time.
I look forward to it.. Are you still on a bus ride?. I hope you have/had a safe trip.. Goodnight
Awesome.. Are you safe and warm or walking back?
Ah. Are you staying there? Because it's pretty cold outside.
Ah! That's good planning!. And brushing your teeth so not to bother your roommate.. So smart.
It's thoughtful at the very least.
And smart because you avoid the cold.
:O. Sounds like a difficult task.
Just have to barter for it.. Or... or take it from them
Great. Goodnight and sweet dreams
Sleep tight.
Any time. I hope you had a nice day today.
Good luck with everything.
I'm sure you're busy today and tomorrow, since break is coming up.
So you'll be busy then too.. I hope you have fun.
What are you up to right now?
More character designing. I've also lined up a voice actor for young bear.
Just doodles right now.. I want something unique that doesn't feel forced.. It might seem like a waste of time, but I want it to be good.
No problem.. Goodnight and sleep tight.
I hope you have a safe trip to Blacksburg (either today or tomorrow)
When are you traveling?
Oh wow!. So sudden.. I haven't yet taken your Kiki costume bits back to your house. I appologize, but is there a good time for you for me to do so?
Okay.. I can bring it to you, if you would prefer.. I'm glad you're safe.. Goodnight
I would offer to tuck you in, but I'm so far away.
Any time.. I hope you have a nice Thanksgiving break.
Thanks.. Would you like to see me at all?
What would you like to do?
I really would like to know though. I suppose you already told me that you were planning on doing work over break.. So I guess that's what you would like to do.. :/
I would like input.
We can do that.. When would you be free?
Okay. Did you want sweet potato casserole Thursday?
Oh.... I was hoping to celebrate Thanksgiving, or at least part of it, with you.
Eat food and play games... I guess you weren't looking forward to it.. With me*
I've been feeling like you don't want me around any more.. Like you don't want me as your boyfriend.
I don't have any Thanksgiving plans, otherwise I would invite you to them, but I don't think you'd want to go anyway.. I'm sorry... I've been feeling neglected.
You don't like talking to me any more.
:/. It hurts.
It means you don't like me anymore.
You don't take it further from small talk. You don't even start the conversation. You always expect me to. I try to start the conversation with small talk so that I can get to a deeper conversation, but you don't allow it to go further.
I assume you don't care because you've told me that you don't like talking to me.
If you don't like to talk to me, and you don't like to be around me, then it sounds like you don't want a relationship with me.
I don't think you want me any more, so I suppose.
You're not making any effort to make me think otherwise.
Tomorrow won't be any different.. Goodnight.
It's not what I wish for.. I thought I could win you over with sweet potato casserole, since you said you wanted some, but now you say that you don't.. You don't like sharing with me any more.. The last kiss you gave me was a friendly one on the cheek.. This has likely been going on for a while though.. I'm sorry. I'll quit bothering you and let you get to sleep.
Okay. I'm heartbroken.
It feels like things have changed.. if nothing has changed, then you've never liked talking to me.
I know. I've been feeling heartbroken longer than yesterday.
Because you don't like talking to or spending time with me.. You enjoy talking to and spending time with other guys.. It makes me feel like you don't care to be in a relationship with me.
It doesn't feel like a relationship either.. If we don't talk or spend time with eachother, then there isn't a relationship.. I guess that's it.
That was an accident.
Goodnight.. I can't sleep. I keep thinking about how you've given up on me and that you don't love me any more.
Good morning.
I'm mowing soon, but I can go afterwards.
Now
No, the ones near your house.
I should be good. Thanks.. My lawnmower shot a stick at my eye, so I'm taking a break until it feels better.. Just giving you a reason why I'm chatting when I'm supposed to be mowing.
I don't have any.
It's okay. No need to go out of your way
Okay. I'm almost done here.
We have two lawns left. I think I should clean up before we walk, unless you want to take me as a smelly.
I'll look for a helmet.. When I get home*
Yeah. I can be smelly.. Or it can wait.
What?. I believe you've done this once before.
This is taking longer than expected. I'm sorry.
I saw your sister was home. Enjoy your family time.
I just finished, if you think there's enough light to skateboard.. I guess it's pretty dark now.. There were 2 extra lawns I didn't know about. Which is why I couldn't take you on that walk.. Well.. I'm available now.. If you still wanted to go on a walk
Okay.. never mind then.. Have a nice rest of your day.
I'm okay. I didn't see anything unusual. How are you doing?. I did see a wooly alder aphid though. I caught it with my finger and she became my best bud.. Until she flew away...
It's a white fuzzy aphid.. Are you only reading about infinity, or beyond?
I didn't take it. It flew away before I could.. Sounds interesting.
Thank you for your condolences.
We don't have any plans. We might make some food.
Not really.. Not any more, at least.
I don't know who you mean by "everyone". I had hoped you would have wanted me around for the holidays.
Not everyone will be around, thanks though.. We're likely going to have a small meal, all 5 of us.
Okay
Will do.
I would if I knew how.
And it becomes a sticker? Sounds like dark magic.
Oh.. right. What kind of stickers are you interested in?
Gotcha
Two polar beara cuddling?. Bears*
Okay
That can be one too
It looks really good.. I didn't realize it came out today. Wow. That's pretty exciting.
I hope you can get some.
You can have those whenever you like.
Yep
If you'd like to, yes.
Up to you.
*poke*
I'm not up to much. I ate some soup.
And talking to Molly. And trying not to rub my eye.
I can see, but my eye is irritated.. I'm also doodling bears.
Yeah. For stickers.
I can do my best.
Yes
Nothing in particular.
I don't have any plans outside of drawing.. I might bring out some board or card games for my family to play.. But there's not a lot of space for that.
Bears. And wizard of oz illustrations--they take a while.. And storyboards. I have a hard copy of the script to work from.
That one?
I can try... It might be tough
Any time is good. If you are black friday shopping, then it can be later if you need to rest.. It can be early though, as that allows for more activities outside.
Nothing is really new. I haven't started any new projects.
Not really. I've followed. a few inking and drawing tutorials.
I guess I don't go out of my way to learn things unrelated to art. I've been looking at how to write screenplays.. And how to write in general.
That's an art.
Maybe not.. I guess I meant that I don't study other things, but I may learn about them indirectly.
I don't restrict what I learn, I just don't allocate enough time to more things.
No. Restricting means that I choose not to do other things. Whereas I am choosing to do certain things more.
Okay.. Art is pretty important to me. And writing is something I'm trying to improve.. I like history and science though..
I'd like to visit various counties around the world.. I like the idea of going to Machu Picchu. I like ruins.. And France, Spain, Germany, England, etcetera have castles and ruins.. A lot of travel stuffs.
I should get my fingertips super strong so that I can do lots of climbing.
To get to certain places you need to hike and climb and ride alpacas.. It would be for general purpose adventure.
What are some things on your bucket list?
That sounds nice.
I suppose I want to create something that inspires people too.. Maybe through a book, web comic, cartoon, or whatnot.
I hope to have a job that I enjoy.. But plans change...
I hope to have a graphic design job, and with enough experience I can become a senior designer or an art director. But I'd also like to learn animation techniques and maybe transfer to an animation studio like Pixar or Liaka.
I guess not. I prefer illustration type projects, but I think I could work well on web design, or ad design. I enjoyed packaging design too, that might be really fun.
What are fake pharmaceuticals?. I think I prefer to design for products, ideas, or for tech companies.. I like designing logos as well. I enjoy creating the user interface for apps at hackathons, but I need more coding under my belt to make those functional.
Yes
Like what? I'd like to have a place of my own with a studio/office.. It doesn't have to be a big place, but enough where I can create.. It might be cool to have a place where I can build stop motion sets.
I just don't know what can be included.. Like what are the typical things? The place of my own, other stuff... I already mentioned travel.. Job, home, and travel are things I've listed.
I listed hobbies too. And I can express a lot of what I enjoy to do in graphic design. If graphic design isn't as creative as I like it to be, then animation and illustration would become my hobbies.. I would hopefully make friends at work.. I don't know what you mean by "purpose". Have you seen this music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0 ?. It's pretty cool!. The music may not be your style, but you can always turn the volume down.
I still don't understand.. What do you think your purpose is?
I don't think I have to define it right now, because it could change. Some may say that any one persons purpose is to be invloved in life and living.. But to be involved, you need passion, but being passionate in something could change into something new. So right now I am passionate about art and my purpose is to create, but it may change in the future.. My purpose is to do what I think is important, and that may change.
I think people who create are pretty important. They inspire lots of people. I would like to be one of those inspirations.. I also think being a good boyfriend is important, but I don't think I've had the opportunity to pursue that.
I don't see you much.
Not when you don't enjoy talking to me.
What do you mean?. You said that you don't like talking to me, which doesn't inspire me to talk to you more.
I think hearing about the small things in your day is very important.
But I ask.
You didn't start anything either.. I was at least saying Hi and Bye because I like catching up with you, but like I said before.. you don't like talking to me, which doesn't inspire me to start conversation.. Or since you said you don't like talking to me, I've been more scarce.. I tried to start conversation before last week, but I wasn't met with conversation. So I started giving up, but I still like checking up on you, so I at least tried to say something some of the time.
What was just yesterday?
You said you didn't like talking to me a while ago.. I think 2 weeks ago.. I just brought it up again yesterday.
Goodnight. Happy Thanksgiving.
Sorry to have worried you.. You've asked before.
I'm looking still. Most companies, as far as graphic design goes, don't want to hire people outside of the state.
Okay.. If you don't think it will work, you should probably cut ties sooner than later.
Perhaps not.
I would prefer not to, but I suppose I should.
I want to work in the field I studied for.
I know that skills can be learned from service/retail, but I've learned some of those skills from mowing. And I've dealt with clients before.
Maybe.
I'll let you sleep.
Is that polar bear how you imagine Bear?
No.. I was just checking.. Goodnight.
I'm saying that you could meet someone else sooner.
You're right. I can do better and I can learn those things on my own.
I've kept you up long enough. Goodnight.
If you would like to. Of course. Sleeo tight.. Sleep*
Great. See you then
That's also great
Sweet dreams, Leandra
Happy Thanksgiving.. It's pretty warm outside. It would be a good day to do outside activities with your family.
That's very pretty!. Thanks for sharing.
That's not even all of the leaves! I wouldn't recommend jumping in them because we have chestnuts.. But it might be fun... who knows!
I was raking. Paige made dinner.. I still have sweet potato casserole to make though.
Okay. I hope you have a great one too. There will be plenty of leftovers tomorrow.
If that works for you!
Of course!. Makes sense!
Of course
Are you asking me how?
I will mash up peeled sweet potatoes. And bake it with some sort of nut on top. I can make corn bread
I might need to make the food tomorrow, if that's okay
We've eaten.
We don't have sweet potatoes and I can't buy them tonight.
Just want to give you casserole.
Yeah, but I will try anyway.
I hope you did too.
I've been looking out for you!. $34 is about as low as you can find it.. Those ones are missing the calf stripe. I think that means it's Condivo 16. I think finding an xs mens would be an equivalent.. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Green-Adidas-Condivo-14-Mens-Training-Pants-Size-Small-G91005-Soccer-Climacool-/112213084876?hash=item1a206bcacc:g:7KsAAOSwXeJYNJ-B. Or you can try a mens small: http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-MENS-ADIDAS-CONDIVO-14-TRAINING-PANTS-BLACK-WHITE-Sz-S-XL-G80820-TRACK-/281412043200?var=&hash=item41857701c0:m:m5wwRqjwGTALApEW6SO9tzg. The adidas website doesn't have black/white.. But they have small in stock.
Have you tried them yet?
Then who knows... You might have to settle with a different type of pants.
It might have to happen!
I'm excited to see you too.
What do you mean? Other than cuddle?
We could watch cartoons like Steven Universe or Moana.. Or.. maybe wait to see Moana.. What did you have in mind?
You can bring over homework. I set up a table in the adjacent room.
Up to you. You can bring it, and if you don't do it, then that's fine.
Are you looking for a second pair of pants for any reason in particular? Would you want more than two pairs since they're discontinued and you need the best ones forever?
How many pairs would you get if you found them?
I found them.
I was asking how many you wanted, because I found the pants.
I made a google search, found websites, and looked up whether they were from a reputable source.. The site seems to be legit.. so I can order a pair for you.. http://www.soccergarage.com/adidas-Condivo-14-Black-Training-Womens-Warmup-Soccer-Pant-model-G89318.html
Hmm it says you need an account, but you can pay with paypal, so if it doesn't arrive, you can dispute it.. It's the cheapest I've found.
That's true-- but paypal doesn't give them card information.. Let me see if there are coupons for the website.
I found 10% off!. It's $36.44 now.. I'll see if I can find a better one.. Wow 30% off.. It's $28.34 now.
A goalkeeper?
I think Katy. My mom will be if she doesn't go with my dad.. No one else should be.
He's going to do some "shopping"
Yup. He needs a few things.. Things that only black friday can help him with.
Indeed. I'm looking forward to seeing you.. Do I need to have anything special ready for you?
Okay. I'll keep thinking.. My mom will be with my dad tomorrow. I hope that's okay.
Cool!. I'll try to make it comfortable here.
Extra comfy then
Of course.. Should I pick you up at 8 or earlier?
Okay!. See you then
Goodnight for now
I raked for most of the day. We have a large lawn, so it toom a while.. I think we finished around 5:30, and we went inside to eat.
They take a while to break down :P
Sure
We might be able to make room
We will see!. I think if there is room for mats, we would have room for jumping.
Yes. It's lasted this long.
Yeah, you can shower here too.
Definitely!
Not at all, unless you think it is.
The jury is still out on that, but I think I can make room.
So that I make room?. I can still try to have it ready by 8.. Unless you would prefer 9 now.
Okay then.. You could always catch up on sleep here though.
I think so
Goodnight.
Okay. I'll go get my shopping done. I'll let you know if I'm later than 9:30
That would be nice!. Are you ready now?
Okay, just checking
I have those things. You can bring your own if you like.
I have no preference. I have a towel and wash cloth ready for you.
I'm here. Don't rush though.
Just 4 minutes ago.. I don't believe we do, though we may have one... I can help carry things.
I love you too!. I'm safe, so I can continue to be that boyfriend of yours.
I'm going on a walk with Katy.
You know it.
But it helps her go on walks and that's good.
I know. I nonchalantly bring up exercise with her.
Thanks! I meant to ask for that.. You can come over Sunday for homework, if you like
Oh.. okay. Never mind then
You can always come over tomorrow.. We can go on a walk at the duckpond and do homework
I can get seeds!
Yeah!. I need corgi bottom videos!
100cc's stat!
I'm not a fan. Why? Are you planning to get it?
Unless it's for a health related reason, I don't think it's necessary.
People can do what they want, I just think it's mostly used for vanity.. There are lots of good reasons for it though.
What are your thoughts?
I know it can beneficial, because I know someone who went through surgery to fix their breathing problems.
It is strange. But maybe the only reason doctors can perform necessary operations is because of the years of unnecessary ones.
Well, it has to do with years of development to make plastic surgery better and better.
It's just a thought. It has to do with new techniques being developed, and a lot of research.
I couldn't give you specifics, because I know little to nothing about plastic surgery.
Money was put into plastic surgery, research could be made, and it was advanced to the point that more successful surgeries could be made. Cleft pallet and other necessary surgeries have only been possible because reconstructive and plastic surgery has been so successful. Have been so successful*
Live patients give better results.
But both are reconstructing and building faces
Oh don't mean that. I mean the years of research that went into helps.
I agree
That's fair
No problem! I hope I can debate more eloquently next time
I wasn't good at those.
Definitely.
I can try
I can try to be useful then!
I'm there for you :3
When would you like to come over tomorrow so we can get shots and ducks?
I'm free the whole day, because even if we are together we can do work things.
Let me know when to pick you up then (:
Maybe I can work out or work out with your sister?. :P. Okay then. Also let me know when you want to go to the thrift store to donate stuff.
Rawr!. Oh, I'll see if she wants to.. I told her that just wiggling around can help her.. Sleep tight, cutie!. By wiggling around, I just mean that by moving and being active, even if it's something small, is a good step in the right direction.
I saw this pretty cool ted talk about someone.. Hmm.. maybe it wasn't a ted talk.. But this man named Jesse Shand had a pretty inspirational story.
Hmm.. I can motivate her to exercise. She has a condition though, but we can push through it.
I don't know what it's called, she just retains weight easily and she has high testosterone.
We don't talk about it much, so I don't recall it.. I don't think it's something she necessarily likes to talk about.
No
I could ask her. In the morning. Shouldn't you be asleep by now?
I can see you behind that wall!
I don't believe you!
I guess you have a point.... High quality sleep then.
Action!
Hello.. I'm okay. My eye has gotten pretty sore.. how are you?
It does???
I don't think so... it doesn't hurt that badly.
It might be a bit swollen, but I can't really tell.. I was going to go with you to the thrift store to donate items, the store to get a flu shot and buy duck seed, and the duck pond to feed ducks.. But that all may not happen, so I'll find something else to do.
Oh, I can participate in that??
Food????. You had me at hello!
No, just from being able to see you was the reward
When should I come over?. I could probably be ready by 2
You sure? I can't get there in -17 minutes.
I will be there soon.. Here
I will. The car is a bit frosty though!. I'm safe! I didn't have the spare key, so your mother had to lock the door. I'm sorry about that!
Good morning. I love you too!
Happy Sunday!. I can acompany you wherever.
I didn't go. I'm hanging with you!
Yep! I want to be with you (:. I have a cat loaf in my room, if you want to feed it
She's ready for you
Okay!. You can do that when you get here
I have dry cat food!
Yes. Maybe I have some veggies they can eat.. It's safe in moderation, but they might not eat it.
Green peas. Maybe cabbage. Don't forgey about the American Eagle box or your electronic recycle bag.. Corn. Oats. And seeds (including bird seed)
Okay!. Ducks will eat rice too. You can park in the back.
That makes you easier to catch.... Dun dun!
Yes! Come on in!. Sorry. I didn't have my phone on me... I was waiting by the door.
Sorry for the trouble!
I saw!. I'll get cookies ready!. You can park behind me across the street
I'm safe!
A success!!!???. That's awesome!. You can pay me, but it would only be going toward the Toronto trip.
You don't have to pay me, I was happy to help you (:. And I'm really glad it went well, because you seemed worried.. And we can work out the budget when you're available.
Sure, I'm open to make anything
Okay, so the 6th through the 9th we will be staying in Toronto, because we can stay somewhere else near Niagara Falls.
Oh, are we going to leave the 10th, see Niagara Falls and sleeo the 10th?
I think that works, and I pulled up the same airbnb :o. Doesn't have a hair dryer, so you may need to bring one if we go with that one. It's also one of the basement apartments I was telling you about.
We can also get a temporary street parking permit, or there is municipal parking available for when we go out and about.. So far I think you found the best Airbnb!. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1162890?checkin=12%2F06%2F2016&checkout=12%2F10%2F2016&guests=2&s=1aewMOI5. This one looks nice, but it doesn't have parking.
I meant free parking, like with the trendy studio.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11909687?checkin=12%2F06%2F2016&checkout=12%2F10%2F2016&guests=2&s=1aewMOI5. This one looks kind of nice and has parking too.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5025880?checkin=12%2F06%2F2016&checkout=12%2F10%2F2016&guests=2&s=1aewMOI5. This one looks great :P. But maybe for a spring-summer stay...
It's a few minutes away from the Scarborough Bluffs. But you're right. Do any of them appeal to you?. The studio district is probably the closest to everything, but Westmount isn't too far away. Cliffcrest is only really close to the Bluffs and some hiking.
Yeah, I looked at that. It's fairly close to the islands and it's right by the distillery district. I guess a better location would be in the Entertainment district, but the Trendy one is definitely a good listing.. I thought so before, but I was checking for other ones too. They also had parking, but the listings aren't as good location wise.
Definitely!!!. Want me to book it now?
Hmm.. one store isn't leaving the option to book a tour at all for Dec 6-10. Tours close on the 4th for them.. It might be closed for winter due to ice. Yeah.. looks like it's off season.. I should have checked before..
Oh, okay!
Overcast with flurries on the 10th
The 6th-8th is supposed to be a mix of sun and clouds.
That would probably work.
That sounds like fun!
So Buffalo, New York?
Nope, that seems like fun!. So I should book now and then look in Buffalo?
I'm working out the message to him:. Hello Mark,  My girlfriend, Leandra, and I plan to visit Toronto for the first time, and we find your trendy studio to be a great place to stay. I am a recent graduate of Radford University where I studied Graphic Design, and my girlfriend is a fourth year studying Computer Science at UVA. We like how central your home is to a lot of the sights, like the Distillery and Entertainment Districts, the Islands, and the Scarborough Bluffs, as we plan to explore a lot of what Toronto has to offer. We do not drink or smoke and we are both quiet and respectful.   Thank you,  Peter. & Leandra. ?
Hello Mark,  My girlfriend, Leandra, and I plan to visit Toronto for the first time, and we find your trendy studio to be a great place to stay. I am a recent graduate of Radford University where I studied Graphic Design, and my girlfriend is a fourth year studying Computer Science at UVA. Your home looks really nice based on your photos. We like that there is a private entrance and that parking is available, as that was a big factor for us. We like how central your home is to a lot of the sights, like the Distillery and Entertainment Districts, the Islands, and the Scarborough Bluffs, and that your home is close to public transit, as we plan to explore a lot of what Toronto has to offer. We do not drink or smoke and we are both quiet and respectful.   Thank you,  Peter & Leandra. Better?. 5481?
I was just making sure. Thank you!. Have a nice class!
Hi, Leandra!!!. How were classes?. Are you ready to catch up on sleep?
My day was a-okay. I've been doing some planning and more drawings.. What are the designs you need commissioned?. Goodnight! I hope you rest well!
Thanks! You can commission stuff unrelated to class too :P
Lucky!!!. Om nom!. Are you "mmm"-ing too?. Did you hear about the shooting at Ohio State?. Nine were injured, but fortunately they caught the shooter before anyone else was hurt or killed.. I was told 9 by Cody, but I just read 11 were hospitalized.
I was kidding about that anyway... I think it's cute..
Kidding about the "mmm"-ing.. Oh no! It was a stabbing.. I heard it from Cody, so rumers tend to spread when your there.. Rumors*
Me too!0
Those were the ones. I'm working on spot illustrations about 4.25" by 2.5"
Small illustrations that you fill a spot with :P. It's one that's within text.
That's good! ToT. Tot*
Po-ta-to!. That's a Lord of the Rings reference, it's related to taters.. Do you like tater tots?
I bet you'd like them. They're crunchy and potato-y.
I haven't had them in a long time, but crunchy is good.. Crispity crunch.
Those are like crunchier pops cereal!. So good! :3
That's okay! I like giving you treats!
And belly rubs.. oh no! I'm treating you like a puppy!
Oh no! I need to do more human things!
Oh no! Dogs do that too!. :p
I'd love to chat more, but you have sleep to get to!
Thank you!!!. Tuck tuck!
1 week :P
Sweet dreams to you!
I love you so much too!!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohb5k3_vQcE Mythbuster 2.0!
I thought you might like it
My Tuesday is okay! How is your Tuesday?
I'm sure! I hope it continues to be good (:
More planning, and I've been looking for those binoculars.
I know!
I will certainly try
That's because I speed up time :o
I wouldn't say the worst.... But I guess it's pretty bad :/. You can't choose your powers though
You did. You did that..!. #superpowersarentreal. I did it too so you would fit in
So today is yesterdays tomorrow, do you know if you need to commission anything from me?
Okay! What's the project?
What do you mean by annotate?
Okay!. I will await further instructions. Captain!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdJVj2x9wNk
Okay! I can wait :)
Sweet dreams to you, Cutie!. I love you :3
(Hug)
Good morning!
Yup yup!. You too?
Oh good!. Have fun!!. Do some pull ups for me :P
I believe in you!
Have a great day today!
Not sure yet.. I know I have quite a bit to work on, but not sure where to start. What do you have for me to annotate?
That sounds good.. Thanks
Oh no!
I can get it for you :3. What do you need me to do with the sutime?
How do I go about that?
When do you need this by?
Okay! I would like to help you with the other one!
They are going well. I may have taken a short nap that set me back though.
2 hours D:
I know!!
Not yet. And I will do
Okay, cool! I have notepad, but that's probably not the same.
Will do!
I'm good. How are you?
That's good!. I'm sorry for not providing thrilling conversation..!
Okay, good! (:
Sweet dreams to you!
That's the plan.
No problem!. I hope it goes well.. I've been having compatibility issues with notepad++, if that's the best option, I may be able to use my mothers chromebook.
Okay. I was worried it wouldn't work the same.
Do you need the second annotations at 11am too?. I don't still have sublime!. But I did once :P
Both at 9am?
Why should the total number of correctly identified dates be less than or equal to 1?
??. How do you want sutime annotated? You didn't give an example for that one. And the second part you sent me is only identifying loc(ation). I'm asking way too late...
What would a false positive be?
Do you want me to annotate within the document?. What happens if it only identifies time, but the time includes the date?
Pasting the example where?. OFFER Sunday, Dec. 7 at 5:30 am BU to MTL 1 place Text 5147162504 or comment! [     {         "end": 31,          "start": 6,          "text": "Sunday, Dec. 7 at 5:30 am",          "type": "TIME",          "value": "2016-12-07T05:30"
It's identifying a time, not a date.. Some of them specify both.
But the "type" is "time", instead of "date"
That's where my confusion came from, I thought there was a difference and it mattered.
Yes, I just thought there was a distinction for a reason.. What happens if two dates are correctly identified in a single post?
I suppose those count then. Thanks. ] anyone going to the twin cities this weekend? i will help pay for gas. [     {         "end": 44,          "start": 32,          "text": "this weekend",          "type": "DATE",          "value": "2016-W46-WE". This one correctly identifies Thanksgiving as a date, but it's unnecessary to the ride:  i'm going to north jersey for thanksgiving on wednesday morning the 21st and coming back saturday. i have two more seats available so message me if you need a ride! i go up 81 so i could drop you off along there too [     {         "end": 42,          "start": 30,          "text": "thanksgiving",          "type": "DATE",          "value": "2016-11-24"     },      {         "end": 63,          "start": 46,          "text": "wednesday morning",          "type": "TIME",          "value": "2016-11-16TMO"     },      {         "end": 97,          "start": 89,          "text": "saturday",          "type": "DATE",          "value": "2016-11-19"     }. When it mentions Thanksgiving break, it doesn't include the start of the break, and only includes Thanksgiving.
But how do they affect the numbers?
Would that note be ['False Positive' -> Thanksgiving identified as date: 11/24] or something?
Okay, goodnight.. I'll try not to need you
I need to know what this means: Anyone going to Virginia Beach this weekend? Gas money Provided! [     {         "end": 43,          "start": 31,          "text": "this weekend",          "type": "DATE",          "value": "2016-W46-WE". Probably the last thing, because it's pretty common.
I didn't know what this:  "value": "2016-W46-WE" meant..
Okay.. Do you want this as an excel?
And the second file you want me to annotate "loc"?
That's the plan.. Believe it or not, but I have at least some common sense.
Aw man.. some of these are inaccurate because they assume the date based on the day of the week, so it would appear to be November, but the post is from Spring.. Or "This Friday" would cut off before it gets to the actual date.. And it messes things up, because they will specify "Tomorrow" and "Friday" being the same date, however, since tomorrow is being assumed by the program and Friday is being assumed, they no longer line up and they become different dates.. I was a bit picky... I have your numbers though.. 119 Dates; 104 Correctly Identified; 15 False Positives; and 5 posts that were not identified, but should have been.. I hope that's everything!. If it's not, I'm awake to get whatever else you need or if I missed anything.. I still haven't found those binoculars, which upsets me because I just had them :P. I'm sorry I kept you up so late...
What does that mean?
Sorry, do you need me to do it again?
They had clear dates, but the app or program didn't read anything out.
I didn't include them because it didn't have any fields to check.. They didn't say anything though. It was just the post.
Nothing was identified in those 5 posts.
I'm confused :/
If it included a "date/time" it got a tally, if it was properly identified it got a tally.
How do you tally something that isn't there?
That's what I said.. 5 of them did not include anything other than the post itself.
Oh. then those 5 had a date/time, but there wasn't an output.. I'm sorry.
I went over 98 posts. 2 that were not relevant to rides.. Of those 98 posts, 104 dates were output correctly, and there were 17 false positives and 5 posts that didn't return anything.. So you would have 96 relevant posts that mentioned a date/time. 104 identified dates, and 17 false positives.. Is that what you wanted?. those 5 posts are included in the 96.. I'm sorry for not following before.... I shouldn't get paid for an unsatisfactory job.
Was I off on the numbers?
:/. I'm pretty confident in the numbers I gave you.. I made an excel document and everything.
No problem.. That one was a bit harder to mess up.
Thanks.. Don't forget to bring your passport to Canada
I really want to find these binoculars for you. I can't believe I haven't found them yet.
They're waterproof, which is nice, but if I don't find them soon I'll need to buy you a pair.. It's not very expensive and it would be of a higher quality since I got mine in the early 2000s
Have fun!. I found binoculars...
I'm joking. They are made of brass and leather.
You can use them :P but it would be silly.. Sweet dreams to you. I tore my room upside down. I don't understand how it disappeared! I did find that T J Maxx receipt I lost though.... I'm so sorry that I can't find it. Unless it's not in my room, I'm at a loss here.. I'll let you know if it turns up.
I'll check here and there and keep my eye on the look out, but for now, I don't know. Good morning!
Have a great day today!. Nice happy Friday
Both have been good. I've been trying to stay busy.
Just cleaning, planning, drawing, and stuff.
mostly just those three things.. I've played a bit of Zelda though.. I can't wait to see you (:
Rawr!. I mean.. eep!
Good job!!
It's going alright. I haven't directly contacted anyone yet, but I've sent out a few more applications. I plan to enter the Addy's as a student too. Deadline is in January I believe.
Yes. So I can enter anything I made during my Spring Semester.. I've only applied to a few places. Zimmerman Advertising, Collab Solutions, and High Five
California, Florida, and New York
If you count Sunday as the start of the week, then yes :P
I saw you Sunday, silly :P
Just something that doesn't happen all that often.
Perhaps... It's the winter season, and I'm not as capable in the cold like a polar bear is.
I know it!
Haha.... That's a large too :P. Do you really want to see a blue berry the whole time?
I have an orange hat too which is pretty warm.. It's very bright and orange.. And blue goes well with orange..
I can try to keep you warm!. https://youtu.be/Wjr_Ul6ScZY
No.. with me? The video is just cool. I think it is!
That's cool.
I recall!. I think you asked me to help with ideas as well
What face is that?
Oh!. I am doodling
I don't have any finished doodles.
His name is Trevor.
Just random stuff. Thanks for liking it though.. So how did you want to be warm?. Those were the ones I thought were okay. Everything else is rough
Oh, okay. Be sure to pack it then.. Goodnight
Sleep tight. How's the other essay going?
Sleep is good! Good luck with them.. Is there anything in particular you want/need me to bring? I'm making a list.
Anything you want or need?. Are those things you want me to bring you?
I asked what you wanted.... I have a good idea what I would need for cold weather.
Layers?
Goodnight.. Were there things that you still wanted to do while we were there?. Right now I'm not planning for it.
And I'm doing the planning..
I was just asking for specifics. I have a general idea about those too though.. Don't worry about it. Goodnight.
I love you too!. Sleep tight, Cutie!
It does! Though it's technically not 8bit
It has too many colors.. The characters are 8 bit, but the scenery is 16 bit at the least
Probably a lot. 64 at least
It refers to the processor. An 8-bit processor can only output 256 colors, but even then there are a lot of blacks and invisible colors.. The NES color palette is pretty small too.
No, because even when there are 256 available colors, not all of then could be displayed at once.
The hardware could only display so much. So I guess it's technically 8-bit, but it's not accurate to the 8-bit that could be produced back in the day.
Yeah.. yeah. I would say that the style they are trying to capture is from the 80's to 90's, so I would say even if it is 8-bit, it's not true to the older grqphics.. Graphics*. Or I'm just picky, and it was a really well done youtube video
I did some "directing" with Cody to get his voice recordings, I changed Bear to have a bigger nose, which I like, and took Katy to Oasis.
What's wrong with the big nose?
Polar bears have big noses.. What would you do differently?
I think the nose does that :P. Teach me your ways if that's not "cutie" enough for you
I thought you wanted the original Bear design though.
You have pictures of him by your bed?
That's true. Which Lily do you prefer?
I'll see if I can find them all... Do you mind if I alter your voice for when your speaking for a child?. Just slightly to make it sound more like a child.
You sure?. I think you did a great job with the voices!
You're a natural!
I really like it, and I think the quality is pretty good.. Do you mean the cast sits down and records together?. Like a table read?
It is where the cast sits around a table and reads the script. They improvise.
Wreck it Ralph has the cast record together instead of in separate boxes.. The only problem is getting everyone together.
Maybe through skype?
Do you want to rerecord?
Okay. I will work it out with Cody then. Thank you!
For being helpful?
Church is having a lunch.. I'm going to make food for it.
Potluck food: Cornbread. What do you suggest?
Those are good.. I'll think about it!. Goodnight.. And good luck!
I made sweet potato casserole with Katy. Good luck with essays and finishing up school work.
I can save you some, if you like.
Or Monday night? :v. Change of plans, Niagara Falls will have scattered showers the 6th, but it will be mostly cloudy the 10th, so going on the way to Buffalo would work, especially since it's pretty close.
Because it could be rainy... would you like to stop twice?. We could see both sides of the falls :P. There are a few things I need your opinion on if you have time.. I probably need your input on more things, but we'll see.
Sweet dreams!
Thank you!. I hope your day is fantastic!. How much do you want to snowboard vs how much do you want to sightsee?
You would rather sight see?
There's lots to see.. Casa Loma is having a Magical Winterland Nights where it stays open until 9pm on Wednesdays. It has a bunch of lights, and it looks really cool.. It's $27 for each person though.. It's a Wonderful Life has been adapted as a play and tickets start at $32.. Though if you spread out all the sights and the single activity for snowboarding, you want to do that a lot more.. Want to snowboard more than any one sight to see*
Which makes it better!. It's a new story
Okay. That rules out ice skating and snowboarding then.
Okay.
Okay
I believe so. We can get tickets at the box office.. I'm really excited about Casa Loma, it's the only castle in North America. But I understand if you don't want to go.. If you would rather do something else*
Oh, cool! I have to confirm pricing then. I'll get tickets for Wednesday!
The checkout for their website doesn't work on my phone (I found that out last night) so I will have to do that at home.. Wow.. a Little Portugal!. I'm mapping where everything is.. Trying to get a good route for each day. Do you have access to a pair of ice skates? If you bring a pair, there are free ice rinks.
The rinks still have rentals, but there are a few that are free. Just checking though. How many days would you like to go skating?. There are more options to ski/snowboard in New York than there are around Toronto (there are none in Toronto, but there are a few in Quebec and Ontario). So snowboarding might be a day trip if we were to do it.
Day or night skating?
Night skating might be neat with all the lights. But I can't skate well in the day.... There's corn pudding here!. We are fortunate that most sights are centralized in the downtown/midtown areas. Most of the food districts are in the area too. There is, supposedly, really good Asian Cuisine further north.
Even then, those restaurants aren't that far. They're up in Markham.. I found a few all you can eat sushi places too, if you're interested.
Yeah, but I'll look into other buffet style restaurants too. I have a whole list of regular restaurants.
I'm doing alright. We got gas at Kroger, I'm still working out the planning, and I'm just about to go out to buy some warm underneath clothes.. How was your day? What's new and exciting?
Yeah, I don't think I have sufficient clothing.. The dinner sounds great!. What show were you supposed to watch?
Oh, I hear that's a good show.. Which sides did you prepare?
Wow! Yum!
Wow.. you could certainly entertain me with food like that!. Or guests like me... Enjoy your time!
I am ready, though a bit rusty
I understand.
I think you're great at papers!. Are you prepared to leave by 6-7am?
I'm getting warm socks!
Random.. do you need me to get anything important?
I do not have warm socks. The warmest socks I have are those google socks.
I don't have a lot of warm anything. Which is why I'm out.
Found some thermal undergarments (:
You know it!. Goodnight and sweet dreams! I hope you had a great time at the party/get together! Good luck with everything! You've got this!!! I love you (:
That's really good!. Good luck with the technique! I'll be waiting at the end of the tunnel!
I can try!. I mean, I can, but if I miss anything, then I tried :P
Oh.. no!. I didn't find much.. would you like for someone else to look over it too?. I think there were only two things that I found, but they are debatable.. I could have Katy look over it too?. Three sets of eyes are better than two!
Ah.. it just read funny to me :P
Would it then be "translations"? Since you have a list?
Okay, then you're good.. Where's the rest of the paper? Or more of it? I can look over it.
Oh, okay!. Anything else I can help with?
I don't believe so.
No problem. Do you need me to do any of your laundry?
Be safe. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Will you be ready by 7am? We can leave later if that would be better for you.. We don't really have to be in Toronto until 8ish.
Awesome!. Don't forget your passport
It's raining, just hop outside!. I don't think we can stop in Niagara Falls tonight.. We could, but we can only spend 30 or so minutes.
Yes
No :/
Oh yeah.. you guys changed the wifi password.... :p
I noticed. Could you bring my clothes from before when you come up the stairs?
Thank you!. I also need to take a few things to the car.
You too. My mom says hello. She enjoyed the cannoli
I'll see if Katy wants to say hello.
I know. My dad says hello. Hello SWEETIE*. That's what my dad says.... Katy says hello too
I felt terrible.. I think you punished both of us.
It's okay.... Still hurting
No, I'll get over it. Thanks though. Have a nice rest of your day.
Any time. I still want to play the 80s trivia
They haven't tried it yet! But I think they will. My family went to bible study
Eep
Cute
Will do
Oh no.. he doesn't know
I just texted him
No problem. My brother says that the lawn has been mowed twice so it would be $60
I thought that too...
Unless Scott meant 3 mowingz. Mowings*
Yep
I can order those for you.
https://www.amazon.com/Bushnell-Waterproof-Compact-Prism-Binocular/dp/B006U0Z72U. Or these: https://www.amazon.com/Bushnell-Powerview-Compact-Folding-Binocular/dp/B00004SABB/ref=sr_1_2?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1481768733&sr=1-2&keywords=bushnell+compact+binoculars. If you don't care about it being waterproof.. And Scott just forgot, he meant $40
No problem. Is there anything else that you need?. What's your team on Fifa?
You said you wanted to play games, we can play!
Cool! Let's play some time
Did I not send those?
Ah, I guess I saw them, but thought the 10x25 were a good compromise with other sizes. You can pick whichever you prefer. Goodnight. I can still accompany you and your mother to her appointment if you like.
Yeah, I can do that. Unless you're still punishing yourself.
Wow, those playlists of yours are pretty good. What color jersey do you want the team to wear? Red and gold?
Really? What would be your favorite personal jersey then?
Like red sleeves and yellow body? Or what are you imagining?
Oh! So just all yellow. With yellow for the linings. Red&. *. Why did I say yellow twice o.o. What would be your team name? The Kelly Clarksons?
Ah, okay! Gotcha! How did you manage to get a polar bear logo?
Is that what you want?
Cool! That's not yellow and red :P
Mostly just red
Really??
Wow! I didn't know you felt so strongly about it.
Like this one: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-Liverpool-FC-2006-2007-Adidas-M-AWAY-shirt-jersey-06-07-YELLOW-/171884865188?hash=item280522e6a4:g:cZkAAOSwLVZVonFL
What's the difference?
I didn't even know it was one
I didn't know it was a beer company
Right.. I know that now. You are more familiar with beer companies than I. Kidding, of course
Will do. I'll be ready by 7 like you wanted
Alright
I see!
I'm a derp
It's smoking. And looks mischevious
Okay
Sure
Any time. Good luck with your test
I'm available whenever you become free
That and fixing the bear
Hmmm... there's still time to consider the name
I'll see what I can come up with!
Eep
Ahhh. Scary
Sure
Oh, okay. Let me get my things together and I can drive over.. On my way
Here
We can take this car, I'm still warming it up. I'm safe and sound
Good morning!
It recently just started :o. How is your day going?. I had a dream that they had new pretzel fries at Burger King and I was taste testing them.
That's good. What have you been up to?
Sounds like the life
Whoa.. whoa! Calm down!. That's crazy talk!
I had a dream that I made the jellbean pig run in a gif, so I might do that.
It was pretty cool
I'm opening photoshop right now.
Accountable for what?
Okay, yeah, I can help
Okay, I will try to keep you going
Good luck!. You have an hour to finish summaries!
What for? To pick up your prescription?
You're reason enough to go!
I have it drawn, but it's not animated yet
Did you finish??
Oh, okay!. I was about to say.... I was almost upset.. The gif is a bit fast.. I can fix that.. (I'm not actually upset, just wanted to show you). I'll make him a lighter pink.
Yeah.. I'm not sure how he should move.. hmmm
Time to grade quiz 2!
Good luck! Maybe you can help me out with the gifs, since you know cute!
Mhmm
Oh no!
True.. you're doing a good job!
No... :(. I was working on this ^^
It's the bear from before, remember?
I'm "finishing" it.
It's a surprise.
Who knows...!
Yes
Yeah
Sure!
I <3 you too. Safe
Yeah, I can try to get those funds to you as soon as I can
That's fine. My brother has two tickets to a Tech basketball game and wanted to see if we could go
1pm
Jessica can't go and the weather is nice so today's a good day for him and my dad to golf
I don't think other people can go.. I'll see if he can sell them
I don't have friends who could go.. He can't sell the tickets
Are you that opposed to going?
Well we can go, my friends are either working or going to graduation.
Are you sure? You don't have to
Okay. I can come pick you up around 12:50. Or.. 12:45
That should be fun!
Will do
Yeah... I'm having trouble finding the tickets
Yes, there's room to park. Got em. I can come get you now
Across the street
There's room in the back though
Whichever spot you feel most comfortable. Either is fine. I'm just giving you options
I thought it would be fun with you, I'm sorry that I didn't just ask if you wanted to go with me.
Good luck with the grading. Be extra thorough for me
Have a nice day
Have fun
How goes grading/ted talks?
I actually met up with a friend and we walked around a few stores while they were Christmas shopping.
I got a few things for Katy.
Some Steven Universe toys
They're the pop figures she collects
It was at Five Below. Do you need to go to Barnes and Noble?
Noted. Have a good rest of your night.
I finished one of the drawings.
Yes
It's not 100% done. It still needs lights.
Is it more of a "exhausted" one?. It's not finished. When it stretches things get displaced, so I plan to retrace the frames.
Ah, I seem. See*. Don't forget to tell me which other ones you need. Tears or no tears-- if you want it to be an exhausted gif
You said that there were a few that you want to use, but you can't find. And you said you would think about the ones you would like to use. I used that gif because I missed you, by the way.
Thanks. Goodnight
:/
Good morning
I'm fine. How are you?
I don't have any definite plans. What about for yourself?
Just more work on designs.
Some of the gifs and a painting.
Yes
Just finishing the one for my book cover
Thanks. You never told me what you were up to
Sounds good. Good luck. If you need any help with anything, just ask.
I was wonderinh if you would like to go to the duck pond with me. Wondering*
I thought later today, but it can be either Monday or Tuesday. Tuesday will be sunny, so that might be a good day.
Sounds good. I can give you your Christmas presents then too.
That sounds good too
Hmmm.... If we drive over we can keep the presents in the car and when it's time to exchange presents we go back to the car and bring them to the pond
See you Tuesday. It's nice and rainy. A good day to do pull ups. Also a good day to spend time with Peter. Especially since you only get so much time to spend with him.. I'll take that as a no
Looking forward to what?. Today is rainy. I was referring to today. But I guess you've lost interest in spending time with me.... Maybe I can just leave your gift on your porch
You're doing a really good job of making me feel like you're avoiding me and that you would be happier away.. You're giving no indication that you want me around, so I would rather leave your gift than feel bad in person. Because before you wanted me around for your homework and to go to the aquatic center, but now you want to do these things alone.
What do you mean by that?
What do you think?
Fine.. I'm just hurt by you then.
You aren't trying. You're not saying why you're frustrated and you aren't giving any effort to see me or talk things out.
Because of how scarce you've been
By avoiding me yesterday and today
By not being around or talking to me
Yes
Yes, and today
I suggested today would be a good day to hang out and do pull ups, and I've tried to initiate conversation, but I don't receive much as a response.
Never mind then.
I said " Good morning" and waited for a good morning to which I would start a conversation.
Okay.
Right, because you got someone elses message. Because I was waiting for a reciprocated good morning. I could have just written everything I wanted to say then, but then you would have had to go down a list and respond..
I was hurt by your tedtalk that you sent because it looked like a means to fix or correct me/my behavior.. you even like to correct me when you're wrong. I wanted to see if you wanted to spend time with me and watch Eloise at Christmastime and have a cook off.
That's fair.. It doesn't help how you react though, saying I'm crazy to think one way, even if it's correct
I listened in school, so that's what I learned.
"Wasn't Bill Clinton impeached" "What? No! That's crazy. But you know who was impeached?" "No" "Richard Nixon" who was not impeached, an acceptable answer would have been Bill Clinton or Andrew Johnson.
But I already knew he resigned to avoid being impeached.
You were very dismissive though.
You could have asked "Really?" Or something. Then we could research it and find whether or not I was being factual.
But I still don't feel very welcome around you, so I'm not sure when we would get the chance.
Look up facts to back up our claims.. Or to be in the same room with one another
I wanted to do something today, Monday, and Tuesday...
But "Okay." doesn't sound like the response of someone who wants to too.
Well, I would invite you over, but you aren't a fan of my house, and you wouldn't want to be away from your mother, so you would have to invite me to your house, but you haven't yet, so I don't believe you want to.
Not really.... You either want me around or you don't
Then you would invite me over.. or invite me to do something
No, I'm pretty sure it just means you don't want to spend time with me.
I don't know either.. I will get your present together and leave it on your porch. I intended to put more together, but I won't have it ready before you leave.
You don't have to save it for Christmas. You can just open it when you get it
Okay.. I'm leaving your gift on your porch now. Get it at your convenience.
No problem
My feelings are still hurt, so as of right now, no.
I don't want to say it again..
I expressed I was feeling hurt earlier when you were frustrated with me.
I guess that was your conclusion.
Just thought you would make an effort.
Just thought you would make an effort to spend time with me.
I did ask you, but you always want me to ask you.
Okay. I don't agree that that is the case.
Then I apologize. I just don't see you wanting to spend time at my house, and I can't invite myself to yours and it's too cold to do much outside and Squires is closed for the holiday and you don't like movie theaters.. I don't think I'm left with very many options.
Assumptions based on past experience.
Nothing. I just have bad experiences asking you to things. You keep asking questions as if this isn't the case
I'm preventing myself from being rejected
But then we're still left off with not spending time together
It doesn't matter now. It's too late to ask you to anything now.
It's 7:35
Awful
I don't care to talk about it.
I did not go. Everything is finr. Fine*. Do you think it's too late to do anything today?. Of course it is. Who am I fooling?
What do you think we could do at this hour?
I can definitely help clean a room
I can' t lose my streak. But I want to, I don't feel like I have to
What time works for you?
That's literally impossible.. I can try to get there as soon as I can
Good morning. Feel free to come over whenever you like!. We're going to need Fifa and your store gift cards. Do you need a ride?
I thought we would do things early.. but I suppose I can wait until 12 or 1pm. I'm trying to guess how long it would take you to do your things.. You can probably give me a better estimate. I can wait longer than that, of course
Okay, so 3:30?
I can help if that speeds things along
It was fun. I hugged you to sleep
That would be awesome! Let me finish up a few things here and I will give you a time!. Should I bring anything with me?
Okay! Should we clean then take things to the ymca?
Then I guess we can go do that shopping?. Then we can come back to my house and play some fifa (or any other game of your choosing)
That sounds good. I wouldn't want to disturb you!. Maybe I would though.... Hmm..
Okay.. if you say so
Oh no! I've taken too long!!. I'm on the way now!. Here. I apologize for giving you such a bad morning
Too bad I couldn't carry the good times over to today
That's not as fun as being there with you
But that's it?. That's okay. I can workout here
I want to workout with you, but it seems silly to me to go over, workout, and then leave.
That seemed to be what you were implying by "just workout"
I don't think I can make it right away. I'll exercise here
Indeed
I should be fine
Thanks though
That sounds like fun
See you then!
Sounds good
He does not want it
Ooo.. they gone. But the leftovers should still be there.. So park if your mom is gone?. His exact words were "No thanks"
Wait to see you? Of course not! I want to see you as soon as possible :P
I see... Well then.. okay! I can wait
Oh no! Late again :/. I'm on my way, I just had a few things to finish up before my shower
A little bit! I had other pressing things to do too though
No, I'll be fine. I can do it when the family goes on the thrift store excursion. Sorry!. Molly is parked behind me
:/. I didn't see these events being a problem.... What I mean is, this was unpredictable.. So even if I gave you a new ETA, it would have been null and void.
I will try to arrive by 6
May be longer.. Scott was keeping the middle seat in his van in the back of the suburban.
Leaving now
Here. Please come get me. Safe!
Goodnight, burrito!. You think so?
Do you want me at lunch? I understand that it's a family thing
Don't worry! I was listening!. I love you!. Sleep tight!
And you too!
I have to follow that? Oh dear!
I can drive the suburban
Leaving now. Eta?. Safe!
Okay!. Should I bring any?
Ps3
But maybe we can use it on an xbox.... And I'll bring a stapler
Oh, but the game only works for Rockband 3. Anything else???
So is today the last day I can see you?
Neat!. But you leave tomorrow, right?. And then come back
Okay!
Mhmm! Let me get some things together!. Would you like to paint today?
We could!. Do you want to paint with me?. I can give you paper and everything!
We can paint anything
Eep!. I gotta get ready!. I'll give you a time in 10 minutes
I gotsta be though!
12:25
I changed my mind about painting. I like using tables, and I have one set up here. Should I bring my laptop?
Oh no! Forgot my glasses!!!. Here!. In the back*. I'm a bit late, but I'm safe!. Good morning!. Have a safe trip today (:
Your messenger bubble is a snow globe!. Merry Christmas Eve Eve!. I love you!
Eve eve*
:3. You stay safe, now. Ya hear?
Thank you! You too!!!
Aww.. shucks!
Size 8 Rampage combat boots!. The size 8 might make it wider and more comfortable!
It's okay! How is yours?
Om nom!. Katy and my parents
Mhmm..! Family time :P
Thrift "fun"
No. We are starving
And the Pho Viet Nam. Do you have a ddr mat for the ps2?
It's just by intec
I thought you would want one to dance with me
Is there a ddr game James doesn't have?
Okay then. I'll keep that in mind!. They should be color coordinated
Is this one familiar to you?
It's 2002
It looks like it has nice cell shaded graphics, which help it age better. And new songs, even if they are old
I don't have a mat to play it myself
That's gamecube exclusive
Jinx
But I wanted to play it with you...
Okay! I might wait to get a better mat though
I love you, bye
Oh hey!! Alan Tudyk was the robot in i Robot, so now he's a new robot in Rogue One!. Just remembered and had to tell you.. Merry Christmas Eve!
Good morning (:
I'm good. How are you? How was Sushi King?
Oh man! Yukai Sushi might not be able to compete!
Don't get upset with me if it's not as good as promised
Okay, good!
Preview
I see you're a fan!
It can when I have one
Should I animate bits of it? The whole thing?
Okay. I like frame 7, so that can be the static comic image. I can always animate it later if I choose to then.
I mean that I can make a comic version and then an animated version.. I finished the outline!
For the comic. Oh no! I lost the eyebrows there for a moment. I fixed it though!
Merry Christmas!. You better sleep or Santa won't come!. Unless that's your plan to keep him from eating your cookies!
Those are for the reindeer!
That's right. You had many bandaids on that forehead. It's supposed to just be hatching though
Not like an egg though
:3. You're sweet!. I'm glad you like the silly animation. I'll send you another preview of the comic later!. Or I can save it to show you in person!
It's just lil ol me!
:3 I can't wait to see you either! I have 3 more comic ideas, but I might need help to make a blog. Maybe time with your family will bring ideas :p
No I don't :P. Goodnight!
Merry Christmas!!!!!!1!111. I hope you got everything you wanted (:
But do you want me? :P. Fresh communion bread!
Mhmm. It started at 11 and just ended. In regards to those "Doo-keys", Holly says: "This is the best gift I could have ever gotten!". So you made her Christmas a lil' bit better. This is Jesus' Birthday cupcake! It's almond cream!!. This one too, but I didn't try that one... Holly is raving about the key set. In sm tuoyingb thod eiyh s clemrmtonr. Translation: I am typing this with a clementine
They were made for her
Me roo@ knuckle time!
I don't have autocorrect :P. How is Christmas going?
Fun!!!!. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself (:
Thanks!. I like where it is paint wise, but I have a lot of touch ups to do in Photoshop!. The color is crazy here.. it doesn't really look like that.
Ahh! :$. The paints I used weren't as nice as my other paints, but they job got the job done. Oh! You're beautiful!
Oh garsh. I spent so much time painting that I haven't finished any piggies or any more comics!
Thanks for thinking so!. I applied for the art and story internships at Pixar last night.. My animation demo isn't ready yet, but I thought I could learn a lot for those and I can apply when it is ready
Wow, so much praise :P. I'm not used to it!
Mhmm!
Yeah you do!. We have rice and cheese instead of mac
Very good!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is playing at the lyric.. Which we've already seen :P. Good morning!
Hi hi!. Passengers, Sing, and Assassin's Creed are playing at the Cinebowl
Yeah!. And jumping from tall buildings. And time travel. Sort of..
Wow! So soon!
Hehe. It really is! :P. Because that's in the title :P
:P. Hello!
Are you home?
Cool! Did you want to go to the movies with me?. Or play games?
Sounds like fun! Do you need a ride over here?. If you want to come, of course. I understand if you're tired and want to rest
You are invited here though. We have left over Christmas foods
Right now until later!
Come when you can (:. Other people might even want to play!
Okay. Would you like me to fix a plate of food for you?
A yes then!. You may park across the street behind Paige's Nissan, or in the driveway behind the suburban
Neat!
Already did!. Thank you! Sweet dreams!. I love you! I'm glad you're safe :3
There's more where that came from!!!. Good morning!
You are invited to my house (:. When are you available?
Okay, when can you be ready?
:P. Okay, then you should try to come by 12:30 or 1. If you want :P. Do you need a ride?
You don't know???. Sounds like you need a ride then
Okay! See you then (:
You can eat here! There's more leftovers and ham!
You can bring veggies here :P. But okay! Come when you can
I don't know, but you can come while I'm eating :p. I can just hide the evidence
Sounds good
Yay!. I shared the album through google drive
Good!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
!!!. I was going to send that!
Hug you!
I lub you too!. Sleep tight!. It's 6:31! Good morning!
I'm a late squash
Hi. What do you want to do after we exercise?
No, I asked you!
I have a claymore and two bayonets. I might have a fencing sword... So like.. a battle to the death? Or what?. My wallet is in the Honda
Fencing swords are dangerous without the proper padding.. And I don't have 2. I'm leaving now.
Here. Are you ready to accept guests?
Safe!
I love you too!. Sleep tight
Me too! If any one asks...
Oh no.. I'm a late squash again. But this time I'm probably rotten
Hello!
You can start exercising since I'm so late.
Yes. Should I bring clothes to change into?
Should I bring anything else?
Okay!. I think I have everything. On my way. Oh, except my dad needs the car.. Here!
Already did0
Okay.. But it's cold out :P
:(. Did they leave early?. Do we need to get you or are you going to try to get a new flight?
Okay. I'm sorry!. We can wait with you, maybe?
What time is the next flight?
Okay.. Do you want to leave now?. Should I leave now?. Is your mom waiting for me to leave?
Of course!!!. I love you!. Do you have a seat yet?
Wow!. A good seat?. Hug you!
You probably could have, but you'd also probably get arrested
I believe you. !!
You too!. Happy New Year's Evea
Eve*. We just got to Christiansburg.
You're so cool! Send me plenty of pictures. Or take me plenty!. Let me know when you board
And we're home!
I love you! Be safe!
Happy New Year!. Ants!
Yes please!. Cute!. So you made it alright?
That's awesome!. And you have some form of wifi at the moment?
Makes sense
Be careful in there :P
Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I love you so so much too!. 2 hours until the new year!
Happy New Year! Still 20 minutes here :P. Happy New Year!. I hope you are having a great day today!
Yep. I ordered a copy of the Wizard of Oz
Yep. There's still more I want to do, but I'm mostly happy as far as the cover goes
Good morning!. What did you do today?
I spent my time drawing, and I'm just about to exercise
I got a bit done, I can't wait to show you.. Just ran a mile.. Took me 11 minutes, so I don't think I got presidential.. Goodnight! Your day sounds nice
I'm excited to see you :P. Sleep tight
Good morning! Have another great day of lectures and adventure!. If you have time you can tell me your favorite part of your day instead of "Goodnight"
That's so cute! The picture was food :P. I suppose my cooking can look pretty scary... That was an accident
More of the same :/ I know how boring that sounds. Just trying to flesh the book out.. The illustrations, I mean.. I went to starbucks with Molly, I didn't order anything, but she read some poetry and I doodled. I also jogged more today.
That's the Good Witch of the North! (:. I love you too!!. That's a cool thatched roof!. And a cool place in general :P
Mhmm, that's one of the new illustrations.
I'm glad you like it!
It's you too! I'm alright. I've been doing touch ups to the illustrations so that they match the full page counterpart.
And I'm also working on smaller spot illustrations to go throughout the book.
How are you?
I bet, what did you do?. It's okay if you don't want to tell me (this has happened before :P). I'm glad you're having fun! (:
That's awesome!!
I like caves.. I will be drawing most likely if not painting. If you need me to do something for you, I can do that too
Oh wow! That would be awesome!
Exciting!. :3. When do you come back? Your mom asked if I would like to accompany her to pick you up (I said yes, of course). I was thinking it was the 15th, but I want to make sure.
Oh no! Unlucky day! :P
That's good! How come it's set for Saturday?
Ah!. Makes sense!. For a second I didn't see the pm/am change.. Hello!. Should I call you?. Or..?
That's okay!
Neat!. Sorry! I was putting my headphones on!. My microphone tends to cause an echo on the other end otherwise.
You froze on me
Oh no.. are you leaving?. I must have given a pretty boring conversation.
I was frozen on your ear. It's a nice ear though
It was really nice to see you!. I hope you are happy (:. Maybe the call was poor because I used my laptop.. would you like to try again with my phone?. I feel sad now.
I thought you wanted to talk
But you didn't really
Did I do something wrong?
What do you mean?
I wasn't working.. I had the drawings with me while I waited for the call, but I stopped.. I think it was because I used my laptop, it was the first thing I answered the call with.
It's very pretty
Cool notes!
That makes sense. Do you need to turn it in?
Oh! So I'll get the chance to read through it?. If you allow me, of course
I would definitely like to!. I would also like to video chat the next time you are free. I'll be a better chat bud
I love you :3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOCtdw9FG-s
Oh!. That's good.. I thought you would like it. Too bad you beat me to it.. It's cute though! (L. (:. Goodnight
Sleep tight!. *tuck* *tuck*. Good morning. I just found out about your bug bites! :o. I like to get updates like that!!. I mean, I don't like it when you get hurt, but I like it when you want to tell me about those sorts of things
Oh, I didn't think they would be, but I like to hear about things and whether you're okay. Gecko friend!. Ruins! You're living the dream!
My day is fine. Enjoy your dinner! What are you having?. Lost you
It sounds like a heart monitor when I call and then flatline
Yeah, I wish I could talk more
I'm not worried, I just like talking to you
Tah tah for now. I love you! I'm down to make tamales with you
I can't see that very well, bit it looks exciting! Is it rain?. Oh, I know! That's the snow!
It's melted snow!. Goodnight! Sleep well :3
Oh no! How are you supposed to play outsidr?. Outside*. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Boop boop!. I hope things are going well! I'm sure it's getting busier as it comes to a close.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I've been painting and getting the book put together to submit for the Addys. My copy won't come until the day it's due, so I'll be printing a copy and binding it tomorrow.. I've got a pretty strict schedule tomorrow :o. I bound a copy of the book and dropped it off for pickup for the addys. It doesn't have all of the new illustrations, but I'm hoping it does well.. I like giving you updates, even though they won't reach you.
Oh no! The new copy is going to the award show. You can see the illustrations though. I bound it myself because the copy I ordered was missing newer illustrations and didn't come in until today.
Wow! That's a nice picture!. I like the way it's framed!. Thank you for keeping me updated!. What were the last few days like for you?. I asked in Viber, but everyone needs a bit of redundancy every now and then.
Wow!!! With your hand?. That sounds really exciting (:. Just kidding.. it looks like you smashed it though, so that must have been fun. I know how you like to beat things up. I love you. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I hope you've had a great day. I lub you too
Oh, hello!
And that is adjusted to the proper time?. I will assume yes
Leaving at 10:10 will probably be a good time.
Okay!. I will be sure to.
I'm alright. I've been worrying over a lot of things though.. but I'm okay. Planning on going on a run soon. How are you doing?. I have the flight pulled up, I'll check it out tomorrow when it's relevant.
Good luck!. That's pretty exciting.. I'll be fun for the rest of your time there I suppose.. My mile time was 7 minutes this time. Or around there :p. Goodnight and sweet dreams. How was the final?
That's great!. What are you doing for your last day? I assume some sort of special farewell. I did more than those two things.. I did more exercises after the run, I applied for jobs, scheduled the next few days, andworked on illustrations.. and worked*
I'm not entirely sure, I just want to keep a schedule for what I do. I intend to make more illustrations, but I have a list of things that I can do.
I have determined the blocks for certain activities, and I have narrowed the activities down, but after 12pm I don't have a strict schedule.. I'm also hoping to spend time with you.. Would you like to spend time with me?. By activities, I mean, illustration and other projects, I will mostly try to work on those.. I was hoping to share tamales or roti prata with you and play outside.. Or we can play karaoke.. What are your thoughts?. Hidden Figures came out, if you would like to watch that with me. Oh gosh.. I'm saying too much and scaring you off.
Yeah! So would you like to spend time with me?. By that, I mean.. would you like to go on a date with me?
Wow! Few.. I was getting really nervous.. My heart is beating faster than it was after my run.. Did you still want me as your Valentine this year?
Wow!! :3. I was worried that you may have changed your mind.. I look forward to hearing about your adventures
Goodnight to you too! Have a safe trip tomorrow.. Sweet dreams!. I love you, Cutie Pie.. See you at 10:18
Enjoy the plane!. '0'
Oh! That's a long time to wait.. What will you be up to in the mean time?
I'm going to clean my room
Thanks. Good luck to you too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGQ9Hlw1DfM&feature=youtu.be. https://youtu.be/r19F6LhzhCA
There are polar bears in the video too!
Yeah! It's great!. I'm glad you made it safely. What will you do with the 3 hour wait time?
Oh wow! I thought it was going to depart by 8pm
Does that mean you won't arrive to Roanoke until 12am?
Ah, you gave me DL1429
That's why I couldn't find it. Google alerts was telling me your flight left at 8:30. That's unrelated to the incorrect flight number I received.
I knew that was wrong, but I had a separate alert for your actual flight
That would make sense. The time is 8:50, not 8:30, but that gives you an hour to board, so it makes sense.. And it says your arriving ~10:18pm. So that's good.
Right, wrong flight.
I have it.
It must be your old flight number. Sorry for the confusion, you seem bothered by me, but don't worry, I have your actual time.
I did.
Do you still want me to be there to pick you up?
It's not up to me if you want me there
That doesn't answer the question
So it's for your mother and not for you then.
So you don't care if I'm there
That's not comforting, but okay. I would be glad to accompany your mother.
It just means you don't want me there or care to see me.
Okay. Enjoy Leo Tolstoy
Looks good
I'm not sure. We have leftover porkchops and soup.
I'll probably have some spinach too
Not great, but things are a bit more organized.
Determining where things should go.. I'm probably going to get some old clothes and electronics that I don't wear/use and donate those.
What did you mean to click?. Just not that?
Ah. That's quite the difference.. I'm ready to let things go. With less stuff my room will be roomier.
Exactly.. Though my parents are free to anything they want to keep.
I was looking at all of the stuff and it made me sad
The same reason it makes you sad.. Just stuff that my family doesn't need to keep. Or even use
I think if there were less stuff that they didn't need they could at least fill it with something cool, like an office, or a workout area.. Then they can get healthy, because that's a concern of mine too.. I think if we had the space we could put in an exercise bike, and Katy has expressed an interest in one
Yeah, but it can only be done by getting rid of things, which can be difficult.
It seems like it would be stalled until the summer, but that's a long time to wait.
It should be, but they work until 4, don't get home until 5 sometimes and then they work for school sport events. It would be easy if they were home, but not so much when they aren't.. I can ask my parents what they think when they get home. In the mean time I need to adjust my resume.
That's true. If there are things they absolutely want to sell or if it's fairly valuable, then that can be put to the side, but if it's anything else then that can be donated. I will discus it with them. Discuss*
The game plan will be one room at a time
The basement is where my dad has his exercise equipment, the living room will just be a living room.. The rules are: if it leaves the room it's getting donated
The living room is where things that need to be donated go, but they never get there. I will check it out.
I think they can get behind it. I'll just be super convincing
Like what?. Or, quick example?
Good to know. That's a big thing there
Probably
And the space we need is only 5%
Sounds good! I will investigate more thoroughly. And have a heart to heart with my parents
Katy was just saying that
Yeah, we will work on it. My other fall back is working at Frosty Parrot
I can. It's not hard to get
Yeah?. I was considering Office Depot. They have a print center
Virginia Madison said the printing center was flexible
Well a print center means that I am handling customers, slight design work, paper and ink, as well as printing machines, which can be relevant.
Molly didn't like it and didn't go as often as she needed to
Printing and handling is pretty relevant, and she likes it
It involves learning more about cmyk when it comes to printed materials
I guess I have to see if they have openings, but if you think Frosty Parrot is a good idea, I can fill out an application
You just seemed pretty gungho about it
I've already been thinking
No, it's welcomd. Welcome* no need to be sorry. I appreciate it
I appreciate you too!. I am having a salad. Not as fancy as your meal, but you know..
Speaking of meal, would you like a snack for when we pick you up?
Okay! Just checking. You never know by the time you land
So full you died! D:
Oh gosh, you're right.. I'm just moderately hungry, so that's still a first world problem.
I have food. Just too lazy to eat it. Just kidding.. I'm eating. Wow!!!
Up in the plane? There's wifi?. Oh!. That makes more sense
True... Of course.. silly me. It's pretty. I didn't notice the light at the top. It looked dark to me. Facebook is telling me that there is going to be a Tangled sequel. And a tv series. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G44HxQpAcI4. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi are back!
We are estimated to be there in 10
Nearly there. Pulling into the airport now. After this red light.
We can see it. Almost at kiss and fly
No problem. We are outside
Arrivals. Sorry for the confusion
Take your time, Cutie. Goodnight and sweet dreams. Sleep tight
My mother and I will be attending lunch today, though we may be a bit late. I am hoping no later than 12:10, but I will keep you updated.
If you would like me to come over I can be there as soon as possible. I bring gifts of roti prata and tamales for dinner. I know you don't want to think about food right now, but you will eventually
Oh, okay then. Have a nice day
I wanted to see you more, but good luck with things.. I was also going to bring my book and illustrations.. You can see those some other time though. Enjoy your Saturday.
Thanks. I guess I'll see you one of these days.. unless you don't want that.. You are invited to my house too, if you like.
I'm getting the feeling that you no longer want to see me... I may be wrong, that's just the vibe I'm getting.. I feel like you don't want to talk either.. so I'll leave you alone.. :/. I'm sorry.. Goodbye
It's from a sad person.. Anyway, have a good life.
I hope you enjoy it and find someone you can spend it with.. Bye
I mean, I hope you enjoy your life.
Not if I'm not going to see you again
You don't want to see me this weekend, you're going back to school Tuesday, you have a busy school year, you're doing something for spring break, if I do see you it would be at your graduation and then you're leaving for a summer trip, after that you'll be in San Francisco. So, accounting for all of that, I won't see you any more.. And I haven't gotten the impression that you care.
Okay. I'm going to be getting rid of some things. Some are toys, and if you would like to play with them before I get rid of them, you are more than welcome to.. I mean sometime... This still smells like grape. Or I can just get rid of the toys.. no problem
Yep. The toys in question
Yeah, this time.
Those were the most "fun" ones. I found that I could have been in NHS, but I didn't follow through with it. It's not important, just thought it was interesting.
I guess
I know
Definitely... Enjoy the rest of your night. I'm sorry about before. I really missed you and I wanted to spend time with you.
I guess I felt hurt that you didn't feel the same.
What changed? You didn't want to?. At least, that's what I gathered. I made several attempts
To spend time with you.. I made lots of suggestions
Okay then. I am available, if you wish.. I'm pretty fun, let me tell you. I'm fast and I don't tire too easily, so you can count on me for a fun tag or hide and seek experience. And talents? I got 'em. I can draw and paint a picture within the lines. And don't get me started on pull ups.. I can do like... 3. So yeah, if you want to hang, I'm your guy
This early?
Well goodnight then.. :/
I didn't enjoy my day
I guess so. I've been sad for most of it.. But that's not important.. I hope you sleep well.
It's not important to you. I'm just saying things that don't affect you
Basing my assumptions on how you've made me feel
No. I just feel like you haven't tried very much and it's making me feel unappreciated and making me think that you don't care.
I wish I knew. Goodnight
You are invited for some Rockband fun tomorrow, if you like.. Or anything you would rather do
Does that mean you accept the invitation?. Or you just appreciate the thought, but you are declining?
You're breaking my heart. I can't keep doing this, I'm sorry.
Trying to spend time with you.. You keep shutting me down. I honestly don't think you want to have anything to do with me, and I'm tired of trying.. You're not making any effort to do anything with me..
I'm trying to find something, that's when you make a suggestionm. Suggestion*. But you clearly don't want to spend time with me.. I'm feeling hurt by you.. And you're not even saying anything.. So I'm going to give up
Give up trying to do something with you, or talk to you, or anything
No. I've felt shunned, I'm avoiding being shunned by you.
That's fine, I just would have thought you would at least like to see me.. And if that was your reason, you should have told me that.
What do you mean?
What's your reason?
:/. That makes me feel bad, because I don't get that much time with you.. Like, you don't have to do anything to have me around.. I thought you liked me around.. But you don't want to spend time with me.... So I wouldn't be shunning you, rather I would be giving you what you wantedm. Wanted.*
You just said you don't feel like it.. It's not an assumption.
And you said "you know I don't want to". I'm just finding it hard to accept that you still want to talk to me.. Given how little you want to see and be around me.. I'm feeling rejected so I don't feel like talking to someone who has been rejecting me.. I can keep talking to you if you want.. But I guess not tonight, since you were going to bed.. And since you won't respond.. Goodnight. I'm sorry for being sad and for overreacting. I will respect your decision for space.. I can be better tomorrow though, I won't make assumptions and I won't mention that I'm sad or anything.. Is that okay?
I won't, because it won't fix it.. I'll be here if you want to talk.. Goodnight.. Sleep tight
I wish you could make me happy :/. Sorry.. I said I would stop
That doesn't stop the ones you hold close to you from making you sad.
I didn't want a romantic relationship today. I wanted someone to spend time with.. :/. The article doesn't help
I don't have anything to offer you or to "serve you growth"
Then in general, I don't have anything to offer.. The article is just reminding me about things.. so it's not helping me feel better.
I'm thinking realistically. I don't have anything to offer you where you are going that someone else could, and it would be better for you because they could actually be with you
I don't find myself much of a person to love
That's impressive.. I know who I am. But I'm not worth the love
That's a shame.. I didn't go through that until now.. It doesn't help that I don't have many friends.
Bro, I just wanted someone to hang with.
Sory. Sorry*. I just wanted to spend time with someone, and I thought you'd be a great person to since I hadn't seen you in a week.
I appreciate the advice and the articles, which I will get to all of them, because I need to work on those things.. I wish you wanted to be that person. I don't get why you don't want to spend time with me.. Could you explain it to me?
Why were you feeling down?
But you rejected company from me?. Is my company not good enough?
Okay, goodnight.. I hope you get funky fresh for tomorrow.. Enjoy your sleep and enjoy your day tomorrow. Misclick. Good morning. There is a lunch after church today. You are welcome to come
You don't even have to see me, you can come for the food, but I want you there.. You don't have to come if you don't want to though.. I understand if you don't come.. Sorry, you told me you didn't want to do anything with me, so I will stop asking.. How are you today? Feeling better?
I'm not so great.. I feel like you're ignoring me.. What are your plans for the day?. Honestly you're making it hard to want to talk to you.
I haven't made plans either. Just going to Church and then the lunch potluck. I hope whatever you decide to do it's fun.
I didn't go last week.
Didn't go then either.. Sorry to disappoint.
I feel pretty disappointing.. Thanks though
I didn't finish all of the spot illustrations that I want to do, but I'm not sure.. I need to fix my resume for job applications.. But I'm not feeling inspired to make anything are related
I suppose.. It's a lot to type out.. I'd rather not.
I suppose I had a few. Again, I would rather not type it out.
I'm there. You aren't impeding anything
I think so.
I would rather not say, because then I would seek your approval.. So I'll make the decision on my own, and you'll find out.
Thank you.. Leandra?. This isn't working for me.
'This'. Not meeting in person and talking.
Then why don't you say so?
You never asked. I asked for us to meet up several times.
Starbucks would be fine.
Okay.
I can go with you.. It's not always safe to go alone.
12 or so. I can leave early
Pkay. Okay*
Why don't you want me to come to your house?
So?. I don't mind.. I've never minded before.. Seems like something has changed for you.
I don't think it would bother your mom.. I invited you to my house too, but you did not want to do that either.. I'm the common factor, so I feel like you're avoiding me.. You're not saying anything to tell me otherwise.
I don't have a preference, I just want to see you.. We can do whatever you prefer.. Which is your preference?. I'll just go with Starbucks, since you won't say anything.
That's fair. Okay, there are plenty of cats.. I also have tamales, so if you come on an empty stomach, I can fill it.
I also have roti prata, so all I'm missing is Sims 2
What happened?. I was kidding about Sims 2. Okay. Enjoy your time. I'm done.
But you'll leave me alone, I get it. I'm not important to you.. I'll stop. I'm tired.. Sorry. I don't mean to be so harsh.
I'm done with the rejection though.. Thanks for showing me how much you care.. Goodbye.. I don't think you're being a very good friend or girlfriend. If we made plans for tomorrow I feel like you'll just cancel on me again.. Anyway, I just made it home.. Not that that matters.. We could meet for 30 minutes at Starbucks.. Then I'll be out of your hair.. Or not.
I didn't go because we made plans. You're not being very considerate. You're hurting my feelings, and I'm getting upset. You can just tell me you don't want to see me again, instead of leading me on. I'm tired of being neglected, uncared for, and unappreciated. Ultimately I feel like we should break up, if this is the way you want to continue the relationship.. Just tell me you don't love me.. Just say something
Everything?. What do you want to say? Do you agree?
You certainly are not acting like you don't agree. Actions speak louder than worda.. Words*
By leaving the messaging app and seeing me. That's an action. Wanting to be with me and doing so is an action.. Calling me instead of texting is an action.. Actually talking is an action, because you're hardly saying anything at all.. Instead you don't say anything, you just ask questions. You don't try to comfort me at all.
Yeah, you won't feel like hanging out tomorrow either, then you'll be at school, where you will be too busy to talk or you "won't like talking to me" at all, then you'll be going to your spring break, which has nothing to do with me, and then you'll graduate, and by that time I won't hear from you, so I won't know to go or not. Then you're going to Malaysia again, and I won't see or hear from you there either. And finally when you come back you're moving to San Francisco.. I'll never see or talk to you again.. But not because I don't want to, but because you either won't want to, or you'll be busy, or you'll be across the country.. Because for some reason you don't want to make an effort.. And the fact that I bring all this up only makes you want to avoid/ignore me more, so it's not going to help, but if I don't tell you then you don't know that you're hurtig me, which then I suffer in silence.. And I assume you're ignoring me, because I see that you've seen my message, but you don't do anything to address the issue or say anything that may help.. It may be hard for you to understand, but since today and tomorrow are the only days you're in town, they're also the only chances we get to spend any time together.. But hey, who would want to spend time with a guy they may call their "boyfriend", it's not like you need to do that to keep a relationshi0.. Relationship*. And that's sarcasm.. I mean, it's fine that you don't want to see me or hang out or talk to me, but that's not a relationship, that's nothing. So I'm confused that you still want to call it a relationship, if you don't want to do anything to keep it a relationship.. I missed you the entire time that you were gone and I couldn't wait to see you, but clearly you don't want to see me again.. Do you have anything to say?
Say something if you want me to listen, I'm making assumptions because you won't say anything.. I will listen.
I don't have a job at the moment, but that doesn't mean you have the luxury of seeing me. You will still be busy.
Based on past events.. In my experience, these are things that hold true.. I already know that this was an overreaction.. And I knew that this reaction would lead to you being less inclined to see me.. I still needed to say something/vent.. I don't think it's fair to say that we haven't had a real conversation in a while. I think that I am trying to start one, but it's not met with anything that continues the conversation. I would also prefer to talk in person.. I think my overreaction was the culmination of a lot of things.. I feel a bit better just having typed it all. So I have calmed down. I apologize.. I will respect your decision to refrain from seeing me, because even if you do see me, the sight will be tainted by my terrible display.. I feel a little bad that you think these are nonissues or that I am completely at fault, but I will be okay. Thank you for your time. I am here if you still want to talk. And if you're interested in tamales, I can deliver them to you for you and your mother to share.. (You wouldn't have to see me, it would be a ring on your doorbell with the tamales in a box). I'm sorry for not being nice. Also, I'm sorry that I didn't condense that as well as I should have.. Are you still selling that item on Craigslist?. Oh, and did you manage the pop the hood to the Nissan?. To* pop the hood
Igloos are really cool! I want to make one, but we need more snow fall. I accidentally deleted our messages, so I got really sad. Now I can't look at those awesome messages any more.
I looked into trying to restore them, but they it was an irreversible action. How'd that they get in there??. Just ignore that!. I'll attribute it to my big thumbs, and because it's chilly in this igloo
I had plans to save snow in coolers! But then I thought it would just turn into ice.
True.. I should have done it!. A real missed opportunity on my part.. We can always play in the mud. Go mud sledding, throw mud balls, make a mud fort and a mud angel. It's like the same thing!. Or I can shave some ice and we can play with that before it melts.
No time like the present!. You've got your soccer jersey just for this moment. I have a few soccer balls if you need to borrow one.. I don't think I saw one in your closet. You had a basketball and a football, if I'm not mistaken.
Yeah? I can go fill one with air rigbt away.. Right*. It wouldn't be a problem delivering it either.. I'm your one stop soccer shop and I make deliveries.
Would you like to today or tomorrow?
I think there are 3, I'll find the best ones.. I need to change into play clothes too.
As a backup, do you have an air pump? Just on the off chance I cannot find mine
Will we also be skating down that hill?. ... will I need a skateboard?. Just asking in case there are more things you want to do.. I can provide snacks too. Unless this is a short thing, that's fine too!
Oh wow!. What are the other activities?. It's so vague!
Goodness. Hmm.. I have those Beyblades, but only one launcher. Hmmm...
I did, my pumps were not great, so I will bring them as they are.. I didn't have to look, I knew where they were :P. We can play basketball too and football, if you like
Only soccer?. No catch? Or hoops?. Totally fine. You have the other games if you change your mind.
Do you have the needle?
Awesome. I'll be right over.. I can be over by 2:35. How does that sound?. It will gradually be later depending on when you respond
Oh, okay. I'll get there right now. Park in the back?. Or the front?. The front looked full. Here. Just got home!. Safe!. I hope you sleep well!. How are you feeling?. We suddenly gained scarfs!
I love you!. Sleep tight!. Unless you escaped your burrito
Good!. That's what I like to hear. Night night!. There is cake here o.o. Good morning
It is chocolate and vanilla
I can make better cake!. What I should I bring instead of cake?
Anything else? Any activities?
And a change of clothes?
Okay!. I'll get ready to play with. The cake is actually vanilla and lemon
I know! Saw you digging into the assorted chocolates!
:'(. I'm leaving now!. It's a lot colder today!
That may help, but you might just want a longer sleeved shirt
Guess who's here!. It was me!. Home and safe! Our hot tub was gone :P. Also, one of us made an enemy. (I think it was you). Sorry if I overstayed my welcome.
Good morning!
I can't wait either!!. Still on for 9? Or a little after? I need to wait to shower until it becomes unoccupied.
Thanks! I have what I plan to wear packed already then.
Okay!. I'll be mostly ready :P
That's great!. I was too late to the game.
You better be!. Just because being late would be bad for your first day back!
Still doing well to getting here at 5:45? You'll probably need to leave at 5:40 or so
You've got this!. I believe!!. Let me know when you are leaving
I love you! You're fine (:
Good luck with everything today!
I know! Good luck with those!. The food didn't freeze into blocks, so I hope the food survived.
Now you can survive!
Wow! Sounds fun!
Hi!. I overslept today :P. I woke up around 11:30
But I've been working on a comic, some illustrations, and job hunting. That's okay! I was helping!!. I suppose I will probably clean out the freezer more now that I know of the horrors that lurk there.
No... should it??
Oh! Did something interesting about cake happen?
I won't find any coconut popsicles that won't have shrimp.. Will the comic be called "The Dessert Pusher"?
It was really good!. You may be too tempted to stop at one portion!
You'll need lots of snacks!. :P
Not enough?. I can always visit you and deliver more
Okay!. Don't forget about the almond butter you wanteda. Wanted!*
I can make the comic for your blog post :P
I'll be ready for when you write it!. I'll have lil' cute characters pulling large amounts of food out of ovens and pots.
Definitely! I can make lil' doodles now! I remember what happened.
Did you close it in your car?
Uh oh!. I don't see it
I don't think it fell out near my house, but I can take a walk down the street
Yeah, that's what I did.. I could drive to Christiansburg for a bit... maybe it fell out there :P or maybe it's caught somewhere in your car.
I'll check one more time in the leaves. Maybe a little towards the Womens Center.. That's not too far.
Just want to be sure. Aqua Lung sport. Still no luck. Do you need me to look up the replacement cap?. Save you some time?. It's a 2004 Nissan Sentra V6, right?. The cap for that is about $12-18
W0133-1921133. https://www.amazon.com/Genuine-W0133-1921133-Engine-Coolant-Recovery/dp/B019S5N3VK?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B019S5N3VK&pd_rd_r=VJG0SE7P72N0SX9G9Q2R&pd_rd_w=6j4z7&pd_rd_wg=b8pkb&psc=1
Ah, of course.. oil cap, not engine cap. Silly me.. $7.49 at Autozone. http://m.autozone.com/chrome-and-dress-up/oil-filler-cap
Sounds good. Positive that it will fit?
Awesome! Sorry I didn't remind you
You could borrow someones prime account if you don't have one. I'm sure someone in the ranch has one.
Do it. Bother her!
Tah tah for now!
You could get Tiki Masala :P. Tikka*. I can't think of anything that I need.. But you could get lara bars, for sure. Maybe dried fruit? That's always fun. Any birthdays coming up that you need to shop for?
Sounda great! I didn't mean to miss your call!
Yes!. Sounds great*. Sounda great is how Mario talks.
Yay! That's awesome. You don't need to buy one now!. Is the engine covered in oil?
That's a shame, but I guess it's not the worst thing!. I'm glad you found the cap!
If not, you could ask a housemate to take you somewhere to get more oil. If they have some time.
I meant if it doesn't run well.
Yeah, that's why I specified. Sometimes the car won't start if the oil is too low.. Where was the cap hiding?. I just meant if it became essential.. you never know. Anyway, goodnight!
That's awesome! (:
Okay!. I can tuck you in!
Gotta get those toe spacers in!
You too!. What time will you be calling in the morning?. Or will you be driving?
Sounds good!
Sweet dreams to you too!
Good morning!!
Thank! I didn't realize it would be so dark. I'll go when the sun comes out a bit more. Have fun at the gym!
I could have walked with you had you not found your oil cap.. Silly me though... I'm glad you found it
I hope so
Cute
Good
Of course. Where are you walking to?
Sims 4 is $39.99, but you can get the demo to try it out!. Sleepless in Seattle played on tv, so I recorded it!
Sounds like fun!. (:. I will look forward to it!
Whenever you like or when you run out of meals. I would like to see you often, but I know that's not practical for you.. I can alwayd visit too, if you like.. Always*
That would be cool!
I had some chili. It was green chili with pork. Have you yet?
Gap hadn't yet contacted me. It's green because of the green peppers and jalapenos
Oh, and tomatillos. It was good!
Yes
That's perfect. This is why you choose to talk to other people...
No, I mean, why you prefer talking to others.. I am very enthused.
And a strawberry. A "strawb"
Is this more enthused?. It's the look of determination.
Oh.. Aw
But I have a long face
Definitely.
Not this one then?
Are you kidding?. Pulling my chain?. Joshing me around?
It didn't look like sarcasm :(. It looked genuine. :'(
Is that what your polar bear form looks like??. This is you because you're sleepy!
Oh no! More sarcasm? :'<
Good!. I'm glad you like my polar bears.. Goodnight. Sleep tight
I love you too!
Good morning. How's your friday?
That sounds great! I was playing a bit of a game called "3D Dot Game Heroes" and now I'm continuing my illustrations.
Not so impressive, I suppose.. Tasty! What are you going to order?. Or was this an accident?. Is the mac and cheese? I don't know what to make of this.
The mac and cheese? You know what it is.. I'm visiting Gap. We're going to go on a 2 mile run together
He has to for training, I'm doing it because we're hanging out. He showed me his tanks too.. He got full marks on a German tank.. Or something like that (in a game called "World of Tanks"). That is a funny menu.
Army tank simulator
No, it's a game. He's played since high school. Goodnight and sweet dreams! I hope breakdancing and ice skating were fun. Have a great day tomorrow too!
I'm still hanging out
I like your calls though D:. We went to Red Robins. We'll leave soon and I will sneak away!
*hug*
Only maybe tomorrow??. Goodnight, Leandra
Sleep tight!. I hope you're having a nice day today
Hello!. What are you up to this Saturday?
I just had lunch, now I'm working on more illustrations.
Thanks!. You too!. Sounds like you're having a lot of fun.
Except you do!. You have your keyboard in your room :P
Piano money. I don't have an upright piano in my house everyday either.
It's true.... Maybe I haven't looked hard enough.. Are you interested in doing anything with me the 14th of February?
Any other plans?
Are you sure? You don't have to avoid it.
Okay. Well I can plan the evening, unless you have something in mind.
Cool. How was figure skating?. And breakdancing? (if you've gone). Perhaps you're in the middle of one of the practices.
That's great!. Enjoy homework until sleep time.. Which dinner are you having tonight?. I've noticed you have been having a lot of meals with people, so that will save you a lot of your frozen ones.
Sounds great!. Enjoy yourself!
I might see Gap again tonight. Not sure what we will be doing yet.. I've only made 2 good illustrations today.
I don't know.. I was hoping for 6 or so. But some of them I couldn't get to look the way I wanted.. Still for Wizard of Oz.. I feel like you'll be disappointed in my progress :/
If you say so
What do you mean?. Are you suggesting something?
Oh... I do often feel like you judge me and that I don't meet your standards.. Are you suggesting you won't stick around though?
What would change?
Doesn't seem like a good outcome could come from it.
I guess so. I suppose I'm used to having you be negative towards how long it may take me to finish something.
I don't know. It makes me less likely to tell you what I did during the day.
I like our relationship. I don't think you're very judgemental as far as the relationship goes, just as far as what I make
I think you allow me to think about things in a clearer, better, and often different perspective.. I think you challenge me and get me out of my comfort zone. And you influence me to try new and exciting things.. There are lots of ways that you are a positive influence.. And I think you've been less harsh with your critiques, but I'm still in the habit to think that you will think negatively of me.. I think your great, but I've been conditioned
I suppose I need to think more positively.. Because I know that you're very supportive.
Not yet, I'm still saving up to pay you. I can pay you interest.
$150 or more.. I think I wrote it down somewhere.. Maybe $300m. ?*
Oh no, really?. How much?
Oh, okay. Yeah. I will pay you interest.
Okay. I'll get a job at Frosty Parrot.. I'll try to make enough.
My dad has a form I can fill out.. I think Mr. Henderson is hiring.. So I will work there
No. The one in Radford is nice, but they hire students as part of a work study. And any other ones I know of are probably too small to hire anyone.
I guess I can check Monday. Most places are closed on Sunday.. I think.
Yep. That's the plan.. Good luck on homework
Om nom!. Did you get the bok choy from your friend (supplier)?. Have fun. Enjoy the soup
You two are certainly close.. Have fun! Soup sounds good. Sorry
That certainly sounds like a lot of fun.
I can help when I get home
I'm leaving Gap's now. Home and ready to help
The Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean will disappear by 2035, might be something to put on your radar
Won't the place I just suggested be too far?
I said it's in the Indian Ocean, near India. St. Lucia looks really nice
That looks nice too. I'm just getting settled in
My room. But I'm ready ready. Is there anything you want me to look at?
It was good. I brought Star Fluxx and we played a short game of it. We also watched a movie (can't recall the title). He made chicken using a suvee cooker. It was really good
:/. I don't really know. It was playing in the background and I just said I didn't know the title.
We didn't finish it, but from what we watched, it was about two kids who worked at a whole foods, but they wanted to move to Brazil
It was a little weird. We switched to watching A Series of Unfortunate Events when Cassidy came home. She's a big fan of the books.
Yes, but that's okay. It wasn't something that didn't exist from the movie.. In case you're sad that I watched it without you. It was only one episode!
It's been announced
Should I watch this with you or..?
I'll go check them out at the library. A producer from the Harry Potter films will be producing the Warriors Movie. Last updated November 23rd. Do you want me to watch the fan episode with you though?
Oh, without me. I thought you would watch it with me to introduce me to the series.. I'll have to check the books out at the library.
:/
"Sound good"
No. Do you have a problem with me?
That was for a different face. :|. That was what I meant to do
Oh, yeah. I suppose I could "feel" that you were busy doing something else like brushing your teeth. Sound good just didn't seem like a response you give someone your focused with.. You're*
Not completely, but I apologize.. Sorry
I guess it's pretty late. Goodnight. I hope you sleep well.. By saying something I've made you have a problem with me.. Sweet dreams
Good morning, Leandra.. I will be there. What will you be up to?
That all sounds good. I was planning on working on a comic idea I had, go on a run, and play with the soccer ball if it's not raining.
It's silly. It's about me making comics. I guess I should set up a website for my comics.
Don't know. It will be a surprise to both of us.
What will we play?
Okay! How will we play?
Hmm... I don't think that will be the same, but if I could do that that would be very impressive.. We could always play something over wifi/steam. Like Bloons :P
I will get on it. You can pick the game we play. If you still want to. I can wait, of course
Yes
Hehe. My computer is starting up
Getting on now
You're not there anymore.
Hmm.. says I can't join. What is your characters name. ?*
https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Play/Bloons-Tower-Defense-5.html#.WIT6x4VSORI
I'm back!. You disconnected!
Oh no!. I'll start a new game for you!. Or I can let you get to work.. we don't have to take away your whole day
Okay! New level?
Yay!
I love you
Om nom ;)
65k
Hug
Oh no! disconnected.. I thought I would sneak into the meeting. Oh no! My ally has disconnected!
I know!. I need my ally back!
Hello!
Hehe. Do you want another go? Or is it time for sleep?
Sleep is good!. I understand
I like when you steal me!. And take my day! I like spending the time with you!
I had a great time with you!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I'm a potato? That doesn't sound good
I love you too!!. Goodnight, potato!. :3
Good morning! Enjoy your rainy Monday!. Or don't.. because rain makes it hard to do some activities..
I'll do my best.
Eep!. (That means hello back, but you scared me all of a sudden, and I love you too)
Pretty well! How about for you?
That's great!. Staples has a job listing for Print & Marketing, so I applied.. Good morning
That's the one
We will see
I love you too!!. I hope you're having a wonderful day!
(Hug). Eep!. You got me!. Mish mish isn't hiring at the moment :o. But that's okay. I submitted my application to the Frosty Parrot
Me too.. me too. I've been looking at tips to better write my resume, but it's been difficult to apply them
I don't have a lot of experience doing it and I don't have any applicable work experience to talk about.
Either as a graphic designer or illustrator
I think that's true. The designers that are chosen often know web design or ux
A lot of my school assignments had clients
That sounds good... I'll try to implement it
Hello hello!
I'm fixing my resume
I've moved, but only to a different room. What are the haps for you?
Oh wow! Turns out? You didn't know before? :P
Oh! Good!
Wow!. Put that on your resume!
Will do!
A banana
That's it
Just haven't gotten around to it yet.
No, just resume improvement
I mean, I guess I also worked on illustrations
No, please stay with me.
It was pretty cold
Great! I'm gradually getting better
I don't have a target. I just want to be more in shape
A little bit
I guess I wasn't "that" out of shape to begin with.
I wouldn't say that.. I just mean I don't feel particularly healthier yet
I think so. Eating and other exercises will too
A few with the Tinman. Look at this one instead**
It's a necessity.
I suppose I should.. the sites are Cody's and Kb's facebook/youtube/twitch stuff
RU AIGA
AIGA doesn't stand for anything. Art directors should know what it is
What do you mean?. The full title is antiquated.
Working on what?
Oh, "these" is plural. I don't know about the poster section because I want to explain the poster for the Seqouyah Birthplace Museum
Should I omit the freelance stuff I did for Cody and Kb?. I think my work is okay, but the content may be less than favorable
Which are?
I don't think there is anything else??
I'm not sure what else could be relevant.
Illustration?
I was going to include stuff from hackathons, but I'm running out of space
How would you refer to social media outlets?
Facebook, twitch, youtube
Do I list those three
Those are the only three I did that for.
Well.. I've done some design work for you recently, but I've mostly worked on comics and illustrations.
I have that in there under book design, should I mention that it's published?
Goodnight, Leandra!. Thank you for the help!
Should I include Hackathon stuff? Or that I worked on Classroom Heroes?
I think that's his name.
Goodnight!. I love you!
I helped with that sort of stuff. I'm just running out of space to cram things.
I'll let you go to sleep, but I'm not sure what is less important.
Good morning!
I'm okay. I just applied for Yelp. With the new resume
How are you today?
That's great!. I'm just on the job hunt. What are you up to?
Indeed and Glassdoor. It was nice chatting with you
Just now? :p
No, I like talking to you, even if it was brief
I'm sorry!. I was trying to finish the resume so you could see it. But if you want to talk again tonight, I can make myself free!!
Aww.... Okay
I don't know... they're all pretty similar, just for different companies.
The tasks they require, mostly.. Always seeking a talented individual with a passion for innovative thinking with 5 years of previous work experience for an entry level position
Yep, Typography, branding, web design preferred, animation and after effects is a plus
Mhmm
A bowl of cereal, some wafers, a banana. May not seem like much, but it's better than chocolate and jerky
I was kidding, nothing beats chocolate and jerky
Hehe
Wow!!!. That's awesome!. Om nom. I hope you're having a good time. I love you!
Boop
For you? Of course!. Lose the call?
I love you too!!
Thanks. Goodnight and sweet dreams. Good luck with Linear Algebra
Oh, then forget that last part. Well.. postpone that last part until you're doing homework
Hehe, sounds exciting. I hope you have a perfect day too. I thought it was funny how often you were checking, but it's cool that you have stocks.
That's a lot of checking in a minute, but impressive that it went up so quickly.. Super cool though!
Oh wow!'. Sounds cool!
Yes
Yum!!. That's exciting!
I can also provide hot chocolate, but it's not so exciting the more you get it
Whoa! Okay!!
Cocoa!. I haven't made any myself.. so I don't really know how great it is at the moment
I'm sure!. Om nom!. I mean.. sip sip. you can't really om nom a beverage.
Can you though? I'll believe it when I hear it!
I don't know... I don't think I heard you om nomming a beverage.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Good morning!
I hope you have a great day!
Thanks! (:. I've only gotten 4 illustrations done so far. I'm slowly lagging behind my expected times.
Some of them have been hard and have taken about an hour and a half. I was expecting maybe 30-45 minutes per illustration. But it's okay, I just made 2 more in an hour.. So it might even out. And I've been eating today, so no need to worry about me
I messed up a bit and my pencil wouldn't erase all the way D:. It's okay though.. :P. Just.. can't fix it. How has your day been?. Have a nice Friday?
I'm holdin' on.. I've finished 9 more. I'm glad you've had such a good day. I'd love to hear about it, but if you get home and you're too sleepy, then goodnight and sweet dreams.. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GzGSAs3dcTI
I won't have a picture every page, but I do intend it to be heavily illustrated.. I think I made it to chapter 5 or 6
Do they want it to look like that?
You can vectorize a gradient.
Did they ever see what I designed before?
What kind of font are they looking for?
I can save the day. I needed a break from illustrations anyway :P. My hand was getting all graphite-y
24 chapters.. So I'm not very far.
But some of the coming ones are shorter than others and require less illustrations.. So do you want the logo made in Illustrator?. So that it's a vector?
What was it made in before? Photoshop will likely look the best for web stuff, but if you need to print it out and make shirts, then an Illustrator version would be good too.
Okay?
Yes, I was opening the file I had it in.. I believe that's everything
I thought so too!. I love you!. When do you need the logo by?
I want to (:
Okay! As long as it's not tonight. The hand drawn font is certainly an oddity
Sweet dreams to you!. Okay! I don't want to hurt anyones feelings though, so I can try to "revamp" what they made.. I will do some more work on it. This is just "cleaning up" the old one.
Is that an ice cream cone with a shooting star?. But the bricks look too new? They are roughened. I can do amimation stuff too
I see that
Good morning!!. Looks like I'm obsolete though
I can keep helping, but if they don't want me, then that's okay
No, I alternate drawing and outlining. No watercolor has been done, but that's the easy part
I can help more with the logo though. I have after effects and I can make the banner look like it's wavy. And designing, but I haven't gotten feedback yet. What are you up to today?
Which start?
What?
You are referring to a specific one?. The black one?
Okay. You like that one?
Do you want it to have more detail?
Like bricks and tower like. I'm sorry for taking so long.
Thoughts?
You mean the banners?
Is that any better?
What part?. Which part*?
I chose that font because it's supposed to be a sun. I roughened the outline. I just don't want it to be lost.
Is it the font?
Is that one funny?
It's solid gold. I can work out a new font.. but I'm not sure anything would go with the tower letters
But the font is bad?
Font sample I have. I suppose you want a serif font.
The above one, yes.. It means it has tails. And other flourishes. Thoughts on that font?. Or do you want a blocky font?
I got you.. I'm trying a different logo too
This is a new one I've been tinkering with.
It's a lot simpler than the previous logos
I think it's versatile.
And it's pretty basic.. You're not even looking at game company logos.. They can range from any number of thing.
I think that the font is pretty basic, but I added a few touches so that it stands out.. Do you mean the favicon?
The favicon is the icon for a website.. I don't know what you mean by smaller version of the logo.
Oh. Do you want an "ST". Or a sun and a T?
Not the new one?
I can fix that, but I guess you don't like the new logo.. I thought it looked really nice.. I can change the color, if that was your issue.. It probably wasn't though... Goodnight
I love you too!. Sleep tight. I'll get on the favicon as soon as I can. Are you positive that you want the gray and yellow version?
Okay then. I prefer the newest one, but I may be biased.
Just because I recently made it.. It's new and fresh in my mind because of that.
Moop
I think it was when the special agents were trying to find Grunkle Stan, because he was creating an anomaly
Right now? Okay
The beginning bar scene
It's the very beginning, only until they sit down, so like 4 things. It's also very rough
It's rough, because I'm still not sure what the characters should look like.
Me too.. :P. Here are some favicons
Oh, yeah.. probably, I just assumed you could scale it, but I can just make it smaller.
Oh, yeah?. I'm sorry about that!. Making you use some site, when I could have gotten it right the first time.. how could I?
Are you sure?. Perhaps..
Is there anything else that you need? When you choose a final logo or want a previous one touched up, let me know and I can send you a .png file.
Okay, I can certainly try.
How did you know???. Do you have snow?
Of course!. Why didn't I think of that? :P. Do you have snow?. It looks like fun to play in!
Maybe soon though. Maybe :P. How has your day been?
That's really good!
It's been a-okay
:P. I'll check it out
What page?
I don't know how to do that :P
My website doesn't have that kind of feature
Goodness
Okay
I know
I guess so. I don't know how to link a wordpress thing to my website, so that sounds ofd. Odd*
No
Yes, I think so
Sounds like fun
Oh no!. You'll just need a new name!
Take it while you can!
Namecheap
Mhmm
Start your blog?
Good luck. I can help illustrate things if you need things illustrated
You hafta. If you want to. I know that it's tough to get your username, so you need to get it preemptively
Oh nose! They took it!
I can help too. But I know you're capable
If you like
Soundd like it!!
I don't know... names are tough
Probably, unless the webcomic needs a name
I mean if the comic has a stand alone story. It would need a name for itself
I can't go to that. Can I?
Wow.. I remember that, but I didn't know that there would be more for me
It's trur. True*
Snow and illustration fun times. What about for you?
A blog pact?
We could post every Friday
Oh, what would your schedule be like?
Sounds good
I will post to tumblr, twitter and facebook. I suppose I need a facebook page though. I was going to post ever Tuesday and Thursday
I've never heard of those
I guess I can do those too
Yes
Yes
Oh no!. I haven't heard back yet
I'm not sure
Just a few more Wizard of Oz ones.. I'm getting there.... Good thing I bought more paper
When are you going to bed?. Well.. goodnight and sweet dreams!
Good luck!
Good night!. Sleeping. What are you doing?
Sounds nice! All that's left is to tuck you in!
Sleep tight!
I love you (:
https://youtu.be/a6QHzIJO5a8. The platypus says hello and wants you to have a nice day!. So do I!!
:3
That they do. I'm cleaning.. but I want to work on a comic and on Bear n Bear. What are you doing today?
I can do branding for you.. It could save you some time for other activities
That was going to be my second suggestion
Of course
Only if you want to
It was a birthday gift
Mhmm. Time to get back to cleaning
Not very long. I got to work on a few things before my dad requested help.. But it seems that I'll be working for the rest of the day.. But that's okay
I know!. Thanks. I love you. I think I'll be ready for posting tomorrow.. Sorry, that was random. I hope you had a nice day. Goodnight. Good luck with homework.
I can help, if you like
That's okay! I can help when you need it.. I was thinking of doing a few illustrations based on pictures we've taken on our trips. You can use those if you want them.
I haven't made them yet, I was going to pick through the ones I took.
Oh, just little illustrations that you can put with the text
Good morning. I was suggesting you could use both. Like the illustration would introduce, but within the blog you would have the actual pictures.. Just a thought. Otherwise, you should have most pictures already. I can send you whatever you need though.
Just let me know. Any update on the game studio or your design stuff. ?*
Okay... Are you busy?
I don't need anything. I just wanted to talk. It can wait. Goodnight. I hope you sleep well
I love you too! I certainly can!
I was not successful finishing it, but there's still some time... Link to your blog?
Makes sense. I'll be ready whenever you call. Good afternoon!
I hope all is well this fine Wednesday evening!. I hope you had a great day! Goodnight and sweet dreams
Sleep tight
That's awesome. Sorry, I'm not sure if you're okay with that
Wow. Impressive
That's so quick
It's interesting, but you have more interesting things to do
It seems like it!
It's that easy
Sounds like you could take on wall street
I guess so!. There's still time to buy more
Hmm indeed. A Monster Calls came out. It looks pretty good!
It's a movie about a kid with a wild imagination
Yeah! It looks fun to watch. Plus the soundtrack has a Keane song in it!
What? No... you think so?
Oh, and it has Felicity Jones, the girl that has the impressive upper body strength
Yeah! Just for you!. Oh, I haven't yet
It is!. I'll see the movie one day
You've sent that before. Probably because you haven't read it either time :P
Really?. Published twice perhaps?
You've sent me one awfully similar then.
Like.. the same one.. but I guess different.
They're both formatted similarly.
They read the same. My bad.
Internships are usually reserved for those still in school..
Maybe, but I can't see the relevance.. I do appreciate it though. I guess I just need to add all of my hackathon design stuff to ny website since it showcases app design and ux
I can't just change my website. And by that I mean change it from one thing to another.. I suppose I can just change it in its entirety.. I hope you had a nice day today.. Are you still planning on coming to Blacksburg on the fourth?
Have a safe trip then!. Goodnight and sweet dreams
I have a youtube channel
There are things...
I see.... I can entertain the idea
I've already tried youtube. The most views I've gotten are 1000
Yes
1000 views was me succeeding.
You're fine
I have worked on it, but I haven't posted yet.
Looks great! I have cc, so I can download that after I update my computer to Sierra.
Ah
Goodnight and sweet dreams. I love you
Possibly not
Perhaps
I could try it
Sounds good.. Sounds like my next big project.
I considered doing a map before. I can get pretty passionate on anything though
No way!. Totally usual
Or maybe I obsess over projects and it only seems to be passion.... Hmmm. I didn't know you were coming back today! I hope you stayed safe!
What are your plans for today?
Running some errands. Does your day have room for me?
Oh wow!. Color me surprised. Would you like to do something with me when I get back home?. It can just be homework
Sounds like fun! Where would you like to study? My house is available, but I'm sure you would be more comfortable at yours.. And is there any time better than another?
Neat!. I will let you know a time then.. Let me know when you are available.. I just got home!. So I can be over in a moments notice.. Unless you've changed your mind.
I can help fix that if you like!
Can I come over anyway? I can sit on the floor
Is that a no?
Wouldn't it be more fun to clean with me???. I can help (:. I don't mind
I can't say I'm not hurt, but okay.
No problem. It's just the way it is.. I hope you have a good rest of your day then. Have a good weekend too.
It's been okay.
I had plans, but they've been cancelled, so I don't have anything going on at the moment.
Picked up a prescription for my grandmother, delivered it to her, and spent some time with her.
She seems pretty sad. She doesn't do anything but sleep all day.
No
Nothing like that. I don't think she has the dexterity to do it. I mean, she may have in the past, but not now.. Do you want to see me at all this weekend?. It's okay if you don't, but let me know so I don't get my hopes up again.
You have laser tag?
That sounds really cool. I'm game!
Can't promise that I'll be any good though
I RSVP'd too
Neat
I'm not sure it will fit you, but there might be something here.. I will look
Neat. I have camo, but you'll have to try it on to see if it fits.
I certainly can.. We would be taking the suburban
I can see if there's any smaller camo, but I don't believe there is.. You can always wear a forest green
Up to you. I have other green things you can wear.. But try the camo first. If you want to.... Goodnight and sweet dreams
Sleep tight. See you tomorrow. Don't forget to get tucked in
I worked on a few things. Finished other projects and ate food.
Just my secret not so secret secret project
I think it looks okay
There is one problem that may occur, so I'll need to figure it out.. For the finished finished part of it. So I'm technically not done, but I'm pretty close.
Sure, that sounds good. See you then
See you tomorrow
Okay. Do you need me to bring you anything?
Sounds good
Yep
See you then. Paige is going to move her car for me, but I will still likely be over by 12:15. Herr. Here*. I'm not her... whoever she is.. Do you still want to call me your boyfriend.. ?*
I had a great time too, but I'm finding it hard to believe that you still like me.. That's okay though.
Maybe so. But maybe you only like me.. Anyway. I'll start using fabric check on the embroidery-- as long as I have some. If not, then I'll need to take a trip to Jo Ann's
Or fray check. Sorry. It prevents the fabric from fraying.
Yes. What do you need it for?
Do you want it now?
No. You're fine.. I will make a selection that you can pick from.
I wish you wanted to see me more.
I don't really wear beanies, so I don't mind.. I'll just have to make sure you can wear them.. My backup is nearly complete.
Soon I will leave the stone age and into the modern world.. I think everyone is gone. Just me and an empty house.
Found Katy, she was just quiet
But there was a funeral... so I assume everyone else is there.
Oh no.. no fray check. Time to head out.. I can pick up anything that you may need while I'm out and deliver it to you.. But I understand if you don't want to see me.
Okay. I'm making a trip.. so I may as well if you need anythingm. Anything*. Is there any particular reason you're minimizing your time with me?
When I ask if you want to spend time with me or hang out you say no.
I like doing homework with you. I had some in my backpack.. But mostly means there's more.
That doesn't bother me.
Okay. I understand then.. I guess I just feel bad because we rarely see each other, so when there are opportunities to, I would have hoped you would try to.
I guess I just wanted to see you more.. Some activities I wanted to do are time wasters though.. so I just wanted to do homework with you.. Well.. let me know if you want anything from the store. I wanted some company on my excursion, but I suppose alone is fine too.
I already asked.. Thanks though.. What kind of lettuce do you need? I can leave it by your doorstep. You won't even have to see me.. It'll be like ninja lettuce.
I guess I'm just looking for excuses to be near you.. But I should take the hint.. When should I expect you tomorrow? 4:20? Also, which foods would you like? I'll be sure to have it ready for you so you can leave as soon as possible.
And your order?. I guess you can think on it, but give me enough time to have it ready for you.. See you tomorrow at 4:20pm.
(And if you can let me know what foods you want and how many, that would be great)
You don't have to do that. I can grab them and go. There is a nice sunset at the moment.
I lost the angle I saw. Otherwise I would send you a picture.
That's the best I could manage unfortunately.. Please let me know of anything you need, even if it's just something small.
I just need to spend more time with you.. But I meant at the store
Just got there. So let me know. I don't mind stopping anywhere.
You sure? Any snacks or things you would get yourself?. Think about your coming weeks
If it's about me dropping things off, I can hold onto them until tomorrow when you pick up food.
I will stop bothering you then.
I meant I would stop asking. Don't forget to pack your slackline
That sounds like a good use of your time.. I was looking forward to seeing you for a bit, but that's okay.. Seems to me that my predictions are coming true though.
Just that I won't be seeing much of you.. I think you have a good idea of what you can or can't do, so skipping spring break sounds like a good idea.
I was not aware that I was invited. I would like to help. Hopefully I will have worked at the Frosty Parrot enough to save up.. I just got home. I just remembered that you can have some of my dad's birthday cake when you stop by tomorrow. It's not super sugary, so I think you will enjoy it
I have skill in design and app stuff too
Which ones?
No. I need to update my portfolio to showcase more of that.
Hopefully. I'll check it out once I install the end to my computer as we know it
Separate portfolio? How many portfolios should I have? A generic one, a graphic design one, an illustration one, and a web/app/UX one?
They could all come from a base portfolio and I can send the specific ones to the specific jobs.. Is that a good idea?
I meant the base portfolio is www.petermattox.com, the other ones could be /illustration, /graphicdesign, /etcetera
Yes. Why am I not UX? Can I not apply to those?
Okay. Well I can still try to get some basics under my belt.
But he doesn't know me.
I think I fit the bill.. I've heard of sketch.. I'll download it.. After I download sierra. I'll get the trial. It's $99.
Okay. Well I will try to stay on top of things then.
I have a todo list.. I will do that.
What's wrong?
The one you have is perfectly fine. Don't worry about it.
I will do it. I'm beefing up my linkedin profile now
I added 25 courses..
I will touch on it more later.. You could make your robot draw things
Making art would be neat :P but I've also seen 200 year old automatons do that.
I know of some kids, but they didn't even want to voice act. Gap's brother Jet likes robots and video games.
He's interested in technology and girls, so he may have a good time. It could work. I have the dslr you could use. So does Gap though.
Neat
It's a joke, but Gap would probably find it funny... Just based on passed experience with Jet, though he is olderm. Older*
... 12?. Maybe younger?
I think he still qualifies. You saw him at Gobbler Fest
He has been before.
I doubt it, so it would likely have to be a special trip.. I can check with Gap though. Or you can..
Maybe.
That too
Definitely.
Gap has a video of Jet in the bathtub that has so many views.
Where are you getting these?
I guess if you got me something I would wear it.
No one would see them.. I would rarely see them :P
That sounds awfully cute too.. What brought this up?
Ah.. target audience.. I would definitely wear something if you got it for me.. Also I can't find the video. Gap may have removed it. Wait. It was buried. https://youtu.be/As1EiyBzP2k
I guess you'll have to wear it
There's always this: http://m.ebay.com/itm/Adventure-Time-Mens-Jake-In-Pocket-T-shirt-Blue-Rockabilia-/182329651575?nav=SEARCH&varId=484876966968
I guess so
Pusheen in a pocket would be really cute
Perhaps. https://www.google.com/search?q=pocket+pusheen+shirt&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS653CL653&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=638&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1tvzM9vfRAhWl3YMKHSrqDPgQ_AUIBygC#imgrc=mfFBGvhbfidflM:
Unless you come up with something cuter!. Like... you in a pocket!. Or a polar bear..
Oh no! Sad again?
How can I help?
I can come give you a hug. Or tuck you in for sleeps. Or give you ice cream
Or anything you want. Ice cream? Did that pique your interest?
Oh, but I can tuck you in!. Or I can do so in spirit. *tuck* *tuck*. *forehead kiss*. *hug*. *turn off light*. *leave door slightly cracked*
*rush back in*. I forgot to put your toe spacers in!. *untucks*. *puts toe spacers in*. *retuck* *tuck*. *forehead kiss*. *hug*. *stumble in the darkness*. *leave door slightly cracked*
*rush back in*. *stumbles in darkness&. **
*cuddles*
Not a big fan of whatever tail thing that is, but it looks like a fine font. Using it on your blog?
On the l
Roboto looks nice. So does Droid
Domo arigato. Mr. Roboto. :P
My computer is updated. It looks so weird
I'm not a fan, but it's okay. Are you going to sleep soon?
Sleep tight *tuck* *tuck*. *cuddles*
Oh. I was petting Addie, and I pet too close to her tummy, so she hugged my arm and licked my hand, which I assume is her version of a vicious attack.
I got licked by a sandpaper tongue!. Rawr to you!. Did you watch Timeless with your mom?. mum*
I bet it gets more exciting!. Don't be scared to eat some Jackfruit chips either!
I got excited when I saw them!. I thought they were gone forever. Not really.. but they stopped stocking them for a while. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
*tuck* *tuck*. I washed the embroidery. I was too scared to dry it, so it's air drying. I think as long as you air dry, you can wash the shirt with a problem.. We can double check where you would want the design to go too. Depending on how early we do that, I could probably give you the shirt before you leave tomorrow.. But if you trust my judgement, I can go ahead and do it, though I want it to sit on the shirt the way you want it to. I remember though, it was about an inch and a half from the bottom of the v-neck (I can make it a little higher/lower though)
It's alive!
I will do my best to realize the shirt then.
I can make stuff for you if you design it
You asked if I could vectorize stuff for you before. Which I still can.. You can use my laptop if you just want the software
Of course. I would like to. Good morning!. I hope your sleep was nice and cozy
Still on for 4:20m. ?*
Okay, cool. See you then
I'm also available all day until then, so don't hesitate to ask if you need anything or if you want to see me.
:/
Just sad.. Anyway, let me know how I can help with your website.
It's nothing. Forget about it.
Nothing to you, I mean. I'll still be sad.
I want to spend more time with you than it seems that you want to spend with me.. Or at least that's how it feels.. But you've got so many friends that you get to spend time with and talk to, so why would you even think to spend time with me.
You don't do anything to make me think any differently.. It makes me feel like you don't want me around any more. Maybe you found someone else that fulfills your needs and you're slowly forgetting about me.
Sorry.... You don't have to answer anything.
It just makes me feel bad that you don't want to spend time with me.
That's all the time you want to give me?
I think it's okay to spend time with your friends, I just feel bad that you don't want to spend time with me.. I remember you couldn't wait to see me, now I feel like you would rather not see me.. I could ask you whether or not that's the case, but it won't change anything.
I know won't change anything.. You don't need me around and I don't feel like you want me around.. So why keep me around?
You haven't done anything to make me think differently.. I suppose you don't want to though.
Make me think differently. You seem to be giving up
You're not saying anything. I feel neglected, and you show me that you care as little as you can. I don't feel appreciated.
It's not an assumption if I feel neglected.
I am telling you the way you make me feel. I'm sorry if I make assumptions, but that doesn't change that you're hurting me.. Unless it's an assumption to say that you are.. It just makes me feel worse when you don't say anything. I wasn't trying to make an assumption just now
That's terrible.
Because it involves me fixing it, when I believe that you could fix it.. You're not even helping. You haven't said anything constructive.
Last night you made a sad face, instead of breaking things down, I tried to help by asking how I could fix it for you.. And I've said everything, but you haven't said anything to help.. I've said how I feel and how you make me feel, but you don't offer anything to fix it.. The problem is we don't spend enough time together, which might be fine for you, but it's not okay with me.. A solution could be that we spend more time together, but you have expressed that you do not want that.
We had fun, but we didn't do anything that was intimate (just the two of us). I feel emotionally neglected.. Especially when you didn't want a kiss.
The balloon was an accident.. I'm sorry then.. I feel like it's common that you don't want to kiss me though
:/. Deep conversations are easier in person.. I feel as though you didn't want a "warming up period". If you don't feel close to me, then you should leave me.. The last time you didn't feel close to me, you visited someone who you did feel close with, and you broke my heart.
Yes.. I want to be close to you, I don't think I've ever felt that you wanted to be close to me.. You could start some of the deep conversations.. It's probably like this because you were already close to someone and you don't want to let them go.
It is a problem.. I don't even know what you want from "deep" conversion. I would love to have conversations with you.... You've hurt me because of Edward many times. So I don't think you can say it's not a problem.. Why do you want to be with me?. Also, you said that we don't spend enough time together to be close, so I don't understand why you wouldn't want to.... Never mind.. Do you have a design you want me to vectorize/clean up?. And which dinners do you want to bring back with you.
4:20. But you can come earlier if you need to.. I was hoping to have the shirt done for you.
Yes, but you need to tell me what you want.. I've asked you to several times.
Are you coming?
Okay. Your house? Or pick up location?
Okay
Have a safe trip.. Thanks for spending time with me.
Don't worry about it.. Good luck with your homework.. Please give me the design stuff you want. That way you focus on homework.
That's fine. If you know what you want I can work on things.. Give you ideas n' whatnot. Up to you. I don't want to take it away from you, I just want to help. Let me know. Good luck with your homework
No problem. I hope I didn't forget anything. I grabbed you one of each dinner and 7 big containers of smoothie with 2 baby smoothies. I hope the hat works. I think it's reversable.. so you can wear the same hat, but no one will know!
It's a good beanie.. I hope it fits your head :P. I know I have troubles finding hats that fit...
The last I wore it, I think so.... Maybe. I didn't try it on before giving it to you
That's good then!. At least the hat's a keeper.. Good luck with your homework and branding
Of course.. What kind of branding are you looking for?
Like an "A" made of popsicle sticks?
I can draw some things up-- possibly inspire you a bit more. (As far as logo and design stuff look)
I like "loose" free-hand illustration, which would look good over a collage of things you've done.
I also like watercolor/pastel colors
How about a whale hot air balloon?
Aww.. poor sky whale
What about a watercolor/painterly look?
It would blend in well on a white background
I haven't started.. I was finishing the shirt, but you were too rushed to take it with you.
I guess it's a good thing, I had an idea to finish it off, but yes, it's essentially finished. I can give it to you whenever I see you next
I applied, but I haven't received any form of confirmation.
I suppose so. I'll be going unless I hear otherwise then
I suppose
That's awesome!. I accidentally ruined the shirt
I was trimming the excess cotton and accidentally trimmed the shirt. I got too close to the sun
I was at a good place with the shirt, but I trimmed it closer trying to make it better. The story of Icarus. I'm trying to embroider a border around to to conceal the holes, but I don't think it will work.
It's fine... I just want to give it to you... I guess you weren't too concerned about it though. Or at least you don't seem disappointed.. But why would you be? I'm being silly. When you said "sorry that happened to you" seemed disingenuous. I don't know why.
I don't know.. I can't tell whether you actually care or not. I'm sorry.. Like, you could just be saying that, but not actually care, you know?. I guess I still feel hurt from before, so I'm just expecting the worst.
I'm sorry. I say those things and then you want to stop talking to me, but I'm not very good at talking about how I feel.. I feel worse when you want to avoid me because of it, but then I don't stop and I make it even worse.. I should stop. How's the homework going?
I'm really glad you got an A in Ecology class. Was there more you wanted to say about that?
Okay, I was just checking. I felt bad for changing the subject.. Because you might have been really excited, but I may have dulled it a bit.. I'm just disappointed about the shirt. I'm looking into ways to fix it.. What kind of homework are you working on right now?
Which class?
And what is the presentation detailing?. Or tell me later.. I know you're busy.
Certainly interesting. Thank you for sharing.. I will leave you to it. Good luck
Goodnight, Leandra
Good morning
You too
Eep!
Not at the moment, no.
I would not mind
You've got this. Just fill it with more memes. It is as scary as it looks
Phew. I'm looking over it as you type. I haven't noticed any mistakes yet
I don't know why BBS is more efficient than classical robots, but I can see that they have limitations and people want to improve them. But that's in the footnotes area
Ninja notes
Sure
Good job!
Good luck. The hurdles seem to be spread pretty far apart. Must be a 300m
With hurdles too? That sounds tough. I'll be cheering for you on the sidelines
Go Leandra!. *holds up distracting sign*
*gasps*. Oh no
*woop* *woop*. That's my girl!. *on side line*
Oh no! Don't get cramps!
*me chatting with you*. :P. Good luck! I can tone down the silly so that you're not so distracted.
I'll see you at the end of the finish line though
The pig might actually need to run like this
I did know that
She wants 'em. You can also chat with me of you like.. There are levels to cats
Levels to you???. What kind?
Which level am I on?
I will hold you to it
Oh dear. I believe in you. First paragraph?. Or else...
Half of an or else?
You haven't written enough for me to be confused
Wow.. you don't need that much
That many sentences. I was expecting more
Shhh. *whispers* you've got this
Don't talk to me, just work. You can do it!. You can still send the paragraphs. I just don't want you distracted. Sounds great!. And I still understand it. Looks good. There are too many spaces before "A section of studies identify..."
It's just a small thing. I don't see anything else that stands out
Sounds good
Any time. Would you like snowflake embroidered on the shirt?
What do you mean by test on fabric?. I was thinking something like this
I definitely can!. And I cna too!. I don't know what you mean though. The shirt is 100% cotton, and I embroidered the design onto the shirt.
Thanks!. I'm going to do some touch ups and the snowflakes and it shoulf be done.. Should*
You made it
Victory dance
He's putting on a shirt :o
Someone throws it to him, he catches it with his foot and it's on? How???
I don't know.. impressive though. Whoa! A squirtle in a pocket would be the best!. Or in my opinion.... Because I like squirtle, but he's got a cute dance
A squirtle in their pocket?. That's great!
Oh nose
Cute! Charmander might catch the shirt on fire. I like bulbasaur!
Neat!
Where shirts go to die!. They're cool shirts for sure. Have fun tonight
Sweet dreams to you too. I love you too. Sleep tight
*tuck* *tuck*
I mocked up the snowflakes before I sew them, you can tell me if you want them to be different sizes/shapes or in different locations. Or if you want more
You don't like the look of the snowflakes?. If your amazom stock goes down then you don't make anything!. Om nom smores
What is a funny spot?. I guess I can wait until you try the shirt on and then mark snowflakes in chalk
Okay! I can set it aside then
You can still get more stock and sell before it goes back down and then buy more. Maybe..
Ah
Should you buy google stocks too?
I guess so.. hmm.. you just have to hope a really cool product gets launched. Or is announced. The boosts stocks pretty quickly. That*
That's how it usually works. When a promising product is revealed it gets investors excited.. Example: when Pokemon Go was released Nintendo stock raised by a lot (until it was revealed that they had little to do with the game). But it raised again when the Switch was announced.
Just things to look out for. But Nintendo stock is going down by a lot today
I know, I was just giving an example
The Switch is releasing in March, if it does well stock will go up, but if it doesn't do well, it could go down by a lot. And the have plans for more mobile games
I was just throwing an example so you can see what to look for
I think it does to tech companies. Maybe not 1:1, but anything with potential products and a large consumer base likely changes with its products and consumers
But what to invest in?
Oh yeah, Netflix is good because they have a large consumer base and they're starting to increase profits by creating their own content. Cuts out any companies that they have to pay for content
Sounds interesting. I'll look into it!
Hmmmm
I might upload it to tumblr.. I'm accumulating ideas. I want to post today.
Yeah, I'll do a facebook page and maybe post to imgur.. Imgur gets a good amount of traffic
Of course. Some people put their name
You think so?
ABC, NBC, TBS, CW... you know, the popular channels
Jokes aside, what do you mean?
There are channels?
You seem like you're more of an imgur/reddit user than I. I didn't know about this :P. I don't browse that much, but I mostly look out for art and whatnot
I guess so.. I hope you're having a nice day. Hark, a Vagrant is the web comic I was telling you about before. http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=399
It's so so. Thanks though. Good luck with your homework
I was working on comics, but I don't know what "style" I want. I guess it doesn't matter though. It's difficult to be consistent though. I'm also washing the suburban
Yes. I can't do everything though
Nothing.. You just are expecting a lot, and I can only do so much.
That's not true
Art just takes a while.. So when it takes me a while, then I'm failing your expectations
I wish I was faster at the comics. I think the comes when I develope a style and can do it effortlessly, but right now I don't gots style
Okay.... Well I'm trying.
For me to be finished with everything and to already be employed
All of my projects. I should already have a webcomic up, I should be learning UX and all that
No, I just move slower than you expect me to
Making things takes too long
I can't control whether I get a job
I can control the skills I have, but that doesn't change whether I get hired or not.
Maybe not to your standards
I'm extremely motivated, but I don't do well when I have to change what I'm motivated on
Job applications, Bear and Bear, Wizard of Oz illustrations, my portfolio, web comics, youtube, other things
I want to do these things, but I feel like I have to finish them all at once.
Okay
I would focus on one thing until it was done and then go onto the next thing.
I know, I can do that.. I did that, but it's easier to stay focused on one thing. Other wise it doesn't get finished
It makes me feel worse
I think you could help, but your way of going about it isn't great. Though I can't help you do it differently
That doesn't help
No. I'm already without you. https://www.facebook.com/justsomepita/
Yep, I said I was going to post it today. It's okay if you don't like it
But I would be happier if you did
I mean that it would make me happy knowing you like it
Okay. What's wrong with it?. I guess you won't be very supportive of the comics.
Not every comic will be writing about comics. I just thought this one would be fitting as the introductory comic. But okay. Maybe you'll like something one day.. How was small group?. I wouldn't know how to reach a larger demographic, and I don't want to be known for cute things.
I haven't asked him, but he probably doesn't think highly of him. What do you think about him?
It's true
I agree.. I also think he believes the president has (or should have) more power than he does, which could be dangerous if he tries to do anything to give himself more power. And hopefully no one mistakenly grants him that. Not that it's likely.... I'm just hoping the checks and balance system will keep him mostly at bay.. Am I not saying things right to facilitate a conversation?
Oh. Well fortunately a judge in Washington state blocked Trump's ban on Muslims.. And I believe many others have, but he was fairly notable.
I guess I don't either.. I did ask you about your small group
That's good. What did you do?
What did you learn?. I'm not that familiar with that verse.
Ah. I hope you had fun. Or the company was good at least
That's good. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I hope you had a good day today
I haven't decided. What are you doing tomorrow?
Okay, goodnight
Sounds like a full day. There is a UX design app by Adobe that I'm going to try out. I hope the day is good.. Bye. (The appropriate characters with the diacritic marks were unavailable)
I haven't gotten to "also" yet.. But "You also are"?
That makes sense. I've done my 20 minute practice of the day. Adobe Experience Design is pretty interesting. It's in Beta, but I'm sure it's similar to sketch.. It has a few tutorials that I'm following.
Yep. I may still try Sketch out
Thanks.. Enjoy the rest of your day.. Enjoy your date too
Sounded like you have a date later
Just saying that you should enjoy yourself
Because that's what it is
You've set a specific time and date to meet with someone.
Why would it taunt you?
It's fine. You get to choose who you keep in your life and who you spend your time with.
Okay, so how should I refer to it?. The event sounded more "out of the ordinary" so I was referring to it specifically.
Okay then. I apologize for offending you.. I should refrain from saying much.. Enjoy your time.
Have a good semester
I hope you do well. Don't forget about the five pages you need to write this weekend.
Six if you're particularly inspired. /motivated. Have fun reading those research papers. I hope you learn something cool in your class.
Yeah, the tutorials are pretty useful. I don't know how to implement UX into my portfolio though, so I'll look into that. I didn't know Adobe Portfolio was a browser based app. It's not as intuitive as Muse is.. Anway, farewell.
Not great. Goodnight
I am experiencing allergies.. It has gotten in the way.. I should have worked through it though.. Goodnight.. Have a good day tomorrow and a good rest of your life.
I guess so. Sleep well.
Good morning. That's good.
It's fine. How is yours?
Keep it up
Goodnight
I hope you had a nice day.. Sorry about that. Sleep well
You never have anything that you want to say.. I guess that's the way you like it.. I'm sorry, but you're making it hard to want to talk to you.. But you likely feel the same towards me.. I don't feel like you want me in your life. So I'm going to stop trying to be.. I think you've already stopped trying. So it won't make a difference.. Because you see this, but you don't address it or talk to me much to begin with.. But I just keep typing.. I'll stop now though. It just feel like you're avoiding me or ignoring me as much as you can and I don't understand why.
You are not what?. Never mind. I thought you would address more than just the last part. You have said a lot recently that leads me to believe you don't like me, or that you ever have, and that you want nothing to do with me.. https://www.victoriassecret.com/pink/bandeaus-and-bralettes/unlined-floral-lace-bralette-pink?ProductID=324918&CatalogueType=OLS. This might be the kind you like.. But I don't know.. Sorry.. you can ignore that. I'm being inappropriate.. Goodbye. Good luck with homework
I think so. Goodnight then. Sleep tight
I've been looking at events for the 14th, but I haven't found anything.. I'm sure there are student run events though.
I was just looking for something fun/romantic.. I guess mostly something that you would find enjoyable.. What would you like to do?
That is what I intended to do.. I can stay longer if you like, but that's up to you.
Any preference to a restaurant?
Oh.. Of course.. Okay, that's your decision then.. Why did you ask if we were doing anything if you just didn't want me to come?
Because you're not interested in seeing me anyway.
You don't want to talk about it?
I want you to show me that I'm wrong.. But you're pretty set into making me believe I'm right.
So your inaction tells me that you don't care for me?
The only person I have to talk about this is myself, and he thinks a lot. It doesn't take a lot for me to think differently though. And I'm only overthinking words that you have said to me.. Sorry.. I will let you sleep. Goodnight.. My big thumbs keep pressing that button. I'm sorry. Good morning.. I feel bad that you don't like to talk to me, but you also don't want to spend time with me.. Have a good day. I want to fix these problems, but I can't do it myself, and so far you have given no sign that you wany to help.. Want*
Good luck with everything.. Don't forget about those 5 pages
I'm still working on experience design.. Do you want space?
What do you want?
What does that mean?
Just chatting?
Nothing more?
So there is more?. Or no, there's nothing more?
Do you want more effort in the relationship? Do you want me as a boyfriend, or just as a friend?
You told me that you don't like talking to me, so it has made me want to talk less. And you don't want to spend time with me.
But what do you think?. "Okay" means you don't want to address it.. I see that you liked how things were going, but I think I need more quality time than you are willing to provide.
I can try to believe that.. What are you up to today?
Oh wow! Where is Pearl Hacks again? I hope the shirt design is as cool as last years (I know that's not remotely important, but you know.. cool to see you wear). Turtle bot sounds cute.. Will you have time to write your 5 pages? You'll have time on the bus, but I want you to utilize your Pearl Hacks time.
What does it do?. North Carolina isn't super far, so we'll see if you can write more pages on the way.. I looked it up, it avoids obstacles? Are you going to put it through a maze?
But what can you do with that? Make a little R2D2?. That's what it kinda reminds me of.
Oh, will there me other turtlebots playing soccer?. Be*
Will the robot be durable enough to block the ball?. How hard are you kicking? It can't be that hard.
Still, that could knock down the rovot. Robot*
Okay, so not nerf foam, but like.. uphostery foam. (In ball form). I can picture it now. Sounds cool. I think you could make it so that other turtlebots interact. That might be cool to see.. But likely hard to do.
I know. Sounds cool though. Are you building it from a kit?
Oh, my bad. I thought you were going to build it too, but you're just programming it. Still cool... Sounds like a lot of fun!. I hope you have fun. I've said too much. Good luck
XD design and my comic.. I told you about the Experience Design though. (XD design is redundant)
I think they're the same.. XD is the name of the adobe app
I do plan on putting more work on my website and making the a better user experience. I might need to redesign it.
What do you mean?
I'm not following... Minimize time to job applications?
Yes.
Oh. I think my website is important.
What do you think though?
I was going to add things that I've made to my portfolio. But you yourself said my website wasn't very user friendly.
I can't do much on Adobe Portfolio
Okay
Ooo. That's a good one. It's going down now. When are you going to make your acquisition?
Really? Was now a good time to buy?
It looks like it is about to.. So I guess you could get more when that happens.
It's making a steady decline
Yeah. It's falling and rising, but falling more. So steadily decreading.. Decreasing*
Yeah, that's true. There will be another boom, I'm sure.
But then if it goes down you can snatch up all of the stock.
That's okay. That's when you snatch it all up
Twitter died?. It may have a comeback
It's sell now.. so that's when you buy!. :P. Everyone is leaving, so you can be there for when twitter is revived.
Maybe if you buy really low your net losses won't be that high and your wins will out weigh them.. But I'm definitely no expert on the issue.. Maybe you can convince your mom into buying stocks? It's like the lottery, but you have a better chance of winning. Robohacks in Quebec sounds cool. (Random)
It's a robotics exhibition and hackathon
It's also in Canada, so that's also cool. Did you get your cap and gown yet?
What does it look like? Standard black?
With a UVa logo?. Do you have stoles too?
Awesome!. How's the turtle bot?
All done?. Or nearly there?
Nice!
Good job!. So Pearl Hacks now? Or is the bus leaving tomorrow?. I figured it would be tonight or something.
Oh, I looked up the schedule.. So I know. I didn't know when you were leaving. I hope you have a safe trip
Are you all charged up if not?. Hopefully.. I hope you have a good time. If you need any design  stuff, or just tips let me know.. It should probably just be tips, since it's an all girl hackathon, but if you need design guidance, I can help with that.. I don't doubt your abilities. Just throwing it out there.
No problem.. Cute!
There's probably an R2D2 mod for it. That would be extra cute!. Or a turtle shell?!?. Nifty. Just aesthetic stuff though.. wouldn't help the robot.. Not only cute though, it looks like fun to play with not to eat!
Or just in general. But yeah! Super neat. Is tonight the meet and greet? Or introduction to Pearl Hacks?. Good luck finding a team! Unless you came with one.
Sounds like that dream. Kidding.... Okay, well goodnight then!. Enjoy the pizza
Enjoy your weekend. Keep me updated if you like to.. Otherwise I'll let you do your hard work.. Sleep tight!
Well.. for when you do.
Spent some time with Katy and worked on Xd
Just learning the program so far.. Katy and I ate dinner together and I watched some of the youtube channels that she watches with her.
Katy wanted tacos, so we got tacos
Really now?. I should have gotten one
I got a burrito and a taco. But I would have preferred a bowl for sure.. How was the pizza?
Oh.. it just seems so late to not have eaten yet.. But okay. Enjoy it when you do.
Any sort of seminar going on?
Oh. When you said there was pizza I thought that meant you had arrived already.. Are you enjoying the movie?. You're probably not paying attention to it :P. What are you up to instead?. Enjoy the rest of the ride.
Oh.. I thought "they" were on the bus.. I guess that makes sense.. I thought it was one of those buses with the little screens.
Well I figured it could be one of those too, but you're not watching the movie on it.. A missed opportunity if you ask me... Are you planning your hack?
Okay. Sleep tight then. *tuck* *tuck*. Unless you don't want to be tucked in.. you can untuck yourself.
Sweet dreams
What is it for?. Hello
Mimicme. Umm... Mimic.me I think that's a possible url. Talkfor.me or copy.me
.me just works so well. Talklikeme.com. But all of the domains work with a .com. Mimicme.com
Do you have any ideas?. Myspeech.com. Messengermimic, mychatbot, mebot, mybot, mimicbot, speechmimic, mimichat, chatparrot, parrottalk, mimicky, parrotchat...
For what?. Have you come up with a name yet?. Do you need more help?. Chatclone?
What did you decide?
That's an actual site.
I thought the idea was for you to chat with other people without them knowing that it's just a bot. Chatmeup. Yourchat. Selfchat, chatself, mychat,. ChatParrot. I guess I'm not helping. Good luck :/
I know you do. You asked for help, and rescinded it. Good luck on it.
Not that it helped.
Scrub-a-dub-dub. Or.. scrape-a-dape-dape. I don't know what that means
I know that. I don't know what I was saying.
What you said makes perfect sense.
What's on the menu?
Wow! You're favorite. Well pictures are appreciated. Enjoy dinner!. Good luck too. I hope to see the finished product.. Goodnight
Not yet, but I know you'll be working late into the night.. And I didn't think you were going to say anything else to me, so I was just wishing you a good night of coding/scraping/hacking. Tacos are great!. Good luck with everything
Don't forget to energize while you stay up
Stay hydrated. Make sure your water bottle is filled. I hope you're not too sleepy (unless you're asleep)
Good morning. I hope everything has gone well. I hope you win something. Have a great rest of your day.. It was nice talking to you.
That's beginning to be all you ever say :/. I'm sorry.. but you rarely respond and when you do you say "Thank you!" or "You too!". Which is fine if you don't want to talk anymore or you just want to say pleasantries from time to time.. Have a safe trip back to Charlottesville.. Ignore what I've been saying. It doesn't seem to help by saying it.. You're just going to ignore it anyway. I'll take the hint to stop talking.. Why do you refrain from responding to these issues?. Sorry.. I can pretend like they don't exist
The majority of the responses you give me have been those two. I know that you have said more than that. It bothers me how little you say.. And how seldom you do say things.
Passing it off with "okay" doesn't do anything constructive... I'm bringing up an issue and I want it to be addressed.. There's room for discussion, but you won't do anything about it.. Which shows apathy, which is why I don't think you anymore.
I am bringing up an issue, but instead of addressing it you ignore it, or apathetic towards it.. Act* apathetic. Or maybe you don't acknowledge that there is an issue. Either way, the way you are handling it isn't very sympathetic. Never mind though. I'll pretend like it doesn't bother me.
I can't fix it alone. I've been practicing my "gif game"
I've been working on my ability to find cute/cool gifs.
I practice with Cody.. I can't fix the issues alone though.
Okay. Hang in there. Sorry.. just thought those were cute.
I saw this nickel sized spider crawling next to me and now it's gone.
Hopefully we have an understanding.
I was working on my portfolio on Adobe Portfolio, but it was being finicky, so I switched over to Muse. My old file isn't compatible with the new version, so I've had to start over. I saved and moments later it crashed, so that was good, but I've been working on UX since then. Just more tutorials, but I'm doodling ideas of things I want to mock up and put in my portfolio.
Alright. Sleep tight. More applicable now than before. Goodnight. I hope you sleep well.. Hopefully you finished your 5 pages. But it's okay if you haven't.. I trust that you will finish. Good luck with any homework that you're trying to finish
That's good! Stay warm. Stay comfy
I love you
Just the raccoon?
Oh, good!. I wasn't sure how you would react to them. Sorry.. too many gifs.
Good morning. I hope you have the same
Whoa. That's pretty impressive
Do you plan to purchase more if prices go down significantly after you sell?. After waiting the period of time you need to, of course
I understand that, but if it does :p. Then it's good to buy again, I would think. Oh.. I think I know what "The Big Short" is about now.... Or I understand the title better, because it's about the stock market.. Definitely interesting though. Any new acquisitions you plan to make?
I believe it was critically acclaimed. Stars Steve Carell and it was about the housing market crashing in 2008 (?). These investors saw the crash coming and knew they could make it Big by selling Short. So The Big Short. I'm no 100% on the plot to title relation though. Did you invest in Micron?
So time to buy more
Did you invest in Tesla too?. Or thinking about it
What did they announce?
That is pretty crazy!
What could be the next Tesla to invest in?
Yeah.. a good thing to put more funds in.
I suppose so. Gotta wait for a cool product to be released
It sounds like a game you're playing
Eep :o
It's impressive how much you've done. Are the cases particular games?
Okay, those are pretty popular things for collectors
I'm not :p
That's okay. This was just a doodle. And I'm not surprised how much the cases are. Cases are important to some people. And if the case was missing to a hard to find or rare game that they found at Gamestop they'd be super willing to pay for a $15 case
That's good
That's fair. It surprises me at times too. What have you been up to other than looking at stocks. ?*
I'm brainstorming app ideas to design. I'm going to practice on both Sketch and Xd
That's what I've been doing. But I've been doodling too.. I'm brainstorming multiple ideas and drawing mockups for them
I had ideas for an app where you draw short gifs that you can send to people. Also an idea for a game where you draw the sprite with walk sequences and then you use it to explore games that you can make or other people design. As well as a few social apps, but I'm not sure how those will translate
Okay. I can try those too. I wanted to make things I thought would be unique or something missing that people want
I haven't. I can look some up now though. I hadn't thought to do that yet
Are there any that you know of?. I can find 'em.
Yes. Were my other ones bad?. I'm very interested
What do I need?
And when is it needed by?
Okay. I added "Sol" to the tower logo. Have they seen that one and the newer one?
No go on those then. Okay I will see what I can do. I'll see if I can animate a banner in After Effects. After everything else, of course. I'm definitely seeking compensation for the work though. (Just kidding). I will see what kind of magic I can work
Hello! I'm doing alright. Working on Sol tower stuff. How are you doing?
That's great!. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I hope you had a nice day today. I'm still working on things, but I just wanted to make the early wishes
Sweet dreams. Sleep tight. *tuck* *tuck*
Oh no! Toe spacers.. gotta untuck and retuck. *tuck* *tuck*
Of course. It's part of the routine. Just have to leave some water for you and you're all set
Good morning. Happy Valentine's day to you too
Thank you. I made it for you. I hope you're enjoying your Valentine's day.
I hope you get to spend it with the one you love.. Or with whomever you chose as your Valentine.. Are you happy in our relationship?
No. What are you thinking?. Or what are your thoughts?
Alright, talk to you later!
Hello. It's going alright. How is it going for you?
Did you want to say anything?
Okay.. I wanted you to say something, but I will wait.
You said you would let me know later.
Yes? Do you not have anything to say either?
Okay. Goodnight.
It sounds like you've lost interest in me.
Because you've lost interest and I can tell.. And I guess the lack of support from your part is hurting.. If you want the relationship to end, please tell me.
Just okay?. Is that a yes?
It's just okay that you've been unsupportive?
And you can't change yourself.
I won't keep you up. Goodnight. I can rely on you less for support.
You aren't supportive, so I won't look to you for support.
You don't like my work.
You're unsupportive of my comics.
But you don't support the pages.. It's okay.
You don't follow them
Mostly
How is that not hurtful?. Lots of things are hurtful.
It's @justsomepita
Goodnight. You don't have to like the page
Okay.. Like you don't have to talk, spend time with, or care for me. Goodnight though.. I'm still playing with colors here.. I'm still working on it, but I wanted to give you some form of progress.
You're welcome. If you have suggestions for colors or anything else, let me know.. I know you've lost interest in me, so I won't expect you to say anything.. You should find someone you're interested in.. I still love you. But based on what you've told me, you need someone different.. Please say your thoughts.
I don't mean to place these expectations on you. I know you are capable of making your own decisions, but I am confused where we are in the relationship. Where do you see it going?
You're right.
I need to take some time to think about it.
You do the same. I like the blue and gold color scheme, but someone may prefer gold or a royal blue.. I'm not sure about the stone-- I can roughen it.. I have the other stuff in progress, but nothing to show.
What do you think though?
You can send it over. I know it was the prefered logo.. I will try to get the other versions done too.. Not try. I will get them done, but I will try to have them to you soon
Of course.
I'm trying something out, but would there be any interest in the font looking like this:
That's fair.. Disregard the previous iteration.. Oh-- that one is too grey.
I hope that's the fire effect he is looking for.. Let me know what else needs to happen.
Sure, can do.
I hope it will suffice, but I am armed and ready with a tablet to fix any qualms.
Sounds good.. Goodnight for now. Sleep tight.. Oh, one more thing. I did a slight effect on the sun, it can be removed pretty quickly if it's too much.. Sweet dreams.
Night night!. *tuck* *tuck*. Good morning
Excuse me?
Oh! Neat. :o
Wow! Is that the full good morning?
That makes sense. Zao!. I think I know how to pronounce that... Have a nice day today!
Any particular size?
Not particularly. They can size it however they like. I suppose it depends on how large they want to start at.
Also, if they plan to put this on shirts or print it, I have it in RGB, which is best for screens (it can be printed though) I can set it to cmyk
The svg though? It is vector, so it can be be scaled.
Okay. If it is approved by Matt S, then I can send more.
How do you want it for the splash screen?
Hold off on the resizeable bitmaps?
Alright! I will get the svg and png to you as soon as I can,. can.*
Perhaps a bit biased? :P. I will email you in case something is wrong with facebook's file system.. I know it compresses png into jpeg, so who knows... They are rather large, so I can scale them back too.
People can be biased on things that they're close to.
I appreciate the feedback.. I was mostly kidding.. That's why I included the tongue sticking out emoji.. I'm sorry. Anyway. I made a quick animation mockup. I sent it to you via email.
Yeah, I'm still going to need to tinker with it. Like I said, it's a mock up.. Sort of a preview? For the little scraps to float off they would need to be separate images in after effects.. I can do more if people want me to, but I just wanted a proof of concept sort of thing.
I think I know what effect you're thinking of. Sort of like a ripple flowing through the banner?
I guess I meant that the banner is waving, but there's no shadow variation to say that it's flowing.. I can play with things, I just wanted the go ahead before I invested time into it.. Also-- as a note. I did it in after effects, which may be able to do the extra things, but I may have to do those things in a 3D program.. Do you want me to animate the logo?
I will try to do it anyways. I'll think of it as more after effects (or whichever app I design it in) practice. Thanks for letting me know.. I mean, I will try to do it soonish.. Anyway. I hope you had a good day. Goodnight. Sleep tight!
Sweet dreams, Leandra.
Of course. Vienna is a gorgeous place. When would you be going?
0% APR for 14 months
It's $1000, so that is possible.
That makes sense.
Hopefully!
It has been okay. I "enrolled" in some online classes. I'm really just auditing them, because I'm not interested in paying the subscription fee. Fortunately all the materials are there, and the talks are pretty interesting, so I'm enjoying them so far. I've also gone through some after effects tutorials. I've touched up my portfolio, business cards, and website.. How has your day been?
Character design in video games is really cool so far. It's a 4 week course, but I've gone over most of the material today (I'm on week 3). With the exception that I haven't done the homework-- though I can't turn it in, so I was going to save it for last. There were three artists/character designers (mostly in animation, which is applicable to me for more than video games). Andy Ristaino, works on Adventure Time, has a really cool style, and so does Robertryan Cory, who worked on Gravity Falls. I didn't get to see a good representation of Jacky Ke Jiang's work, but I didn't favor it quite as much. I'm also looking at interactive computer graphics and fundamentals of graphic design (I might be able to learn more!), but I haven't delved into them yet.
I did not know them, but I recognized their work. I'm really impressed by them, so I've taken note of their names and I'm checking out their blogs and whatnot.. Anyway, you haven't told me what you've been up to yet.
Oh yeah, I've been practicing Chinese too, but I'm making slow progress.. What kind of sleep schedule are we talking about? Is it why you're awake at 1 in the morning?
Yeah, I downloaded the app when you first mentioned it.
I have heard about it.. So you save an hour?. Are you giving yourself at least 10-15 minutes away from the computer to fall asleep properly?
Yeah, I definitely think it would help. You have Flux, which reduces the blue light that may affect your sleep, but you may need that on your phone too. I would say you should spend 10-15 minutes without the computer and rest your eyes during that time-- I guess you could do homework on paper or do some quick cardio? Regardless, that should help you fall asleep faster and more naturally, which will improve the quality of the sleep.
The red tint is what helps! the blue light effects you.. Oh I just know you usually sleep, or did sleep, 7 hours. I usually get about 7-8.. Especially since I stay up so late.
Oh I know the difference, thanks for catching that.
Oh no.. have I said those?. Man.. I am really slipping today.
Do I really mess up with your and you're?
It's that consistent? :/. I definitely know the difference.. And it bothers me too, so I'm surprised I haven't noticed.
I thought I was pretty good at catching those things. At least correcting myself when I do make those mistakes.. usually from typing too quickly or using the phone-- I'm not so good at texting on a touch screen.
I was just about to tell you to go to sleep if you weren't.. Goodnight
I'm all signed up on Slack.. I'm searching for the "you're/your" issue through our chat... are you sure someone else isn't giving you compliments?
It's somewhere in these 242 results... If it just happens, then it's an honest mistake.
Yeah, that's why the number is 242, and not 1000+

Hey, thank you for caring enough to send me a message. Don't worry, I won't die, not yet anyway.. But I heard that there is a snow storm coming tomorrow morning.. but it would be cool if the opportunity became available. [Ice cream? sounds like a great idea to me :P]
And that is what makes you so awesome! :D
Yeah.. I guess you're right.. those words need amazingly in it! [Leandra is amazingly awesome]
My throat is feeling much better, thank you for asking.  How's has your day been?
Well that's a keen idea. I also have homework, haha, procrastination is so terrible..
Oh.. I was at track.. so I just got the message :P 1:30 or 2.. which ever time is most convenient.. Fine with me :D
It's all good :P 2 Sounds good to me.. until you change the time.. then that time will sound good to me :P. So.. I got a message from you on Skype.. and I wasn't on when I got messaged.. Weird, I know. I don't know what you wanted to say, but you know.. if you'd like to tell me whenever, it's okay.. or don't tell me, that's okay too.
Oh.. right.. I'm still curious, but okay.
Hey, Well thank you for caring :P I hope I'm better by tomorrow. Also, we should try to set a time to talk or something... to have some good times again :P Sorry about the teardrops on your guitar..  Have a good day :D  p.s. I think I'm going to google the "toast" thing :D
There's always weekends, unless that's a bad time for you.. Oo!!! It's getting warmer outside :)
That's good to know, I guess..
I poked back.. can't be your fault.. and pokes are awesome :)
Feeling great, better, fantastic :)  You?
Just okay?
Nothing much.. I finished 1, maybe 2 songs :D About to go to bed because I have track in the morning. You?
Don't worry, I fell asleep too :P And thank you, I've always wanted to be the next big thing :D
Tracks at 9.. and I plan on having some fun :D Have fun at.... have fun! :D
Homework can always be fun :D If... umm... never mind.. It's no fun.. Have fun anyways :D
I hope so :)
Yes I do have Track today, but I'm up early for an entirely different reason :P
Oh.. well, you see.. I sort of woke up for no reason at all.. but I could really get back to sleep, so I just stayed up :). So.. How's it going?
It's going well, allergies aren't fun though.. Hmm... Why is it that you always seem to feel "okay" or "okayish"?  Sorry to pry, but okay doesn't sound as good as it could :P
Track has been going great.. It hasn't been to hard so far :) And.. and, depressed? :(
Or it's a something but you don't want me to feel bad too :/
:( Well.. if you ever want to talk about it, I'm here.. I doubt it's too bad that it could ruin my good mood :P
I would wish for all my homework to get done, but I think I may wish for you to feel better :) And what would you wish for?
I have a feeling all my homework will get done either way, no need to waste a wish on it :P
Best wish ever :D
That's a tough one.. I'd say 12.5
Oh.. I guess I'm just not unique :P
Thank you! I wish more people would say that :P You're fantastically unique in a great fantastic way of fantastic-ness :P
Aww :) Bye then, have fun :P p.s. Don't get too tired when you're running through my mind all day :P
What?!? When did that happen?. Oh, wait.. must be meant in a sarcastic way. :P
Whoa!!! I haven't even been alive since forever o.O
Am I as cool as you? Then I'd be pretty cool :). If not I can always to aspire to be :)
You're like liquid nitrogen cool :D
Yep, that sounds about right.. I'm zero cool :P
I'm no good at small-talk :P But if you really want to then I'll try and make it work :)
Back home :) I hope the "small talk" didn't disappoint :P
I wish the same... I know what to wish for at 11:11 :P
Maybe it's for the best though.. considering I'm not the best person to talk to :P. Sorry.. I was sort of tired when that came out :P
Soo.. how's it going?
I'm fantastic.. Sorry for my late response.. I was writing songs :P
Me too :P
Not well though :D
What?!? Really? That sounds awesome!
Well.. now that you brought it up, now I want some free ice cream.. weird :P
I have, once.. on a cold day in winter :P
Sounds awesome.. hmm.. Now I really want to go.. but I don't know whether I should or not.. decision, decision...
Err... Hi :) How are you?
I'm doing fantastically :) Thanks for asking.
The Cheshire Cat isn't just cool.. he's completely awesome! :D
The party thing wasn't as fun as it needed to be.. I got thrown up on. Sunday wasn't bad though :)  And how was your weekend?
I did know the person.. it was the birthday boy. It just made everything so awkward..  I drew my profile pic, I'm proud of it :P
Thank you :) Song writing is hard; off topic, but I'm just saying :P
Sorry for my late response, I leave at 1:04 :P And... I have six fully completed songs :)
I wouldn't say I am... Thanks anyways :D
Hey! I.. umm.. kinda learned how to whistle :D And I miss talking to you too, we needa change that :P Have a good Sunday :)
Well, I did say I could KINDA whistle.. haha :P You have a good Monday too :)  I get to play frisbee in Gym, so that's a good Monday for me :D See you sometime in the future :P
Frisbee was amazing! It was almost canceled though, but we got outside in the nick of time :D How was the... time spent.. with life? [Sorry.. :P]
Well that's cool.. Life hasn't been around here lately, but it's all good :P
It left when my heart broke... just kidding; I don't know where life went.. I guess I'm to boring for life to stick around :P
Yeah, once I die, life will be SOOO jealous of death :D
Oh, it's okay, bye an' good night :)
Thank you for warning me!
Haha, you're welcome!
Haha :D Your name kinda sounds the same either way Ooo!! When you sent that message, I was running "Devils Triangles" :P
Awesome!! Well, Hello :D
Life's been great, maybe even fantastic.. How about for you?
That's awesome! I bet your clay sculpture could beat up all the other clay sculptures butts :P
Haha, that sounds really cool! :D I'd like to see it some time :)
I played frisbee in gym.. nothing too spectacular.. I've been writing songs and what not.. IF you can consider them songs, haha :P
Haha, I wish I had Gap's gym period.. I'd show him up at some frisbee :P And thank you, that really means a lot :D
You weren't keeping me from anything, haha But yeah, good night and... Have a FANTASTIC! Day tomorrow :D. Over looked the 4th line, my bad.. I miss talking to you after school too :P Just had to let you know that :D
Haha, cool beans :D Bye bye
Oh, the irony.. Awesome And just one good bye just isn't enough ;)
That guy next to me is my good buddy Stephen Jonhston; he actually helped me get my backpack on, I know, I'm pitiful :P But yeah.. I sort of was on this ripstick and I flew off of it and slid on the ground :) But it's sorta not just my arm :P
Yeah, I was told I'm doing well by the doctor :P And thank you for caring (:
Yep, see you later (:
It's fine :) I found it flattering :P I hope you have a happy summer too!
Well hi! I don't see why I wouldn't be free on those days. Soo, yeah... yep, yeppers :). Wait, is that a Sunday?  I think so... Well, I sure hope I'm available then :P
Okay, I'll see if I can make it..  I have church in the morning and Vacation Bible School in the afternoon, I'll try to find time in the middle :D
No idea, I think between 1 and 6:30
Cool.. Umm... I have the worst case of poison ivy ever.. I'm not sure anyone would want to see that... If one were to be really weird and would, then okay, but if not.. then I'll just stay at home :P
Okay, I suppose I could go.. Just let me know when and where.
Yeah, 2:30 sounds fine.
Thank you! I hope that you can also enjoy cake?
Totally.. I had cold pizza.. so muffins beat what i had :P
Umm.. no, I didn't have a party, haha, just sat home and ate that cold pizza :P
Rainbow cake is.. alright.. I suppose.. I don't really like cake. But I'll eat anything, of course :P
Umm.. I'd have to say... cold pizza.
Yeah, it was great.. Not as such now that it's all gone.
I suppose? But they don't stop the hunger though...
Yeah, surprised me too.
Graphic design is the BEST class ever!!! :D
Yeah, I'm doing pretty well in that class :P So, were you thinking of going to homecoming.. because I was thinking of dressing like Michelangelo.. and it's just too awesome to miss :D. Michelangelo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.. of course..
The Ninja Turtle, because he's from the 80s :D
And umm.. me of course, haha, just kidding :P
Haha, because mutant things are higher on the attractive scale.. but I don't need that, because I'm cool 8-)
Dang.. that's cool though.. I'm beat!
Yeah, I heard of the Format a long time ago.. had no idea the singer left.. so fun. is pretty sweet.
Haha, thank you. You do as well :P Well, [kind of off topic] if Gap goes to Homecoming as a Foot Ninja, and I go as Michelangelo.. things should be pretty interesting :P
Foot Ninjas are Shredders Minions, from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.. they're an enemy against the Turtles. :D
It's like.. late 80s into early 90s.. so I don't blame you for not watching it
It's only if everything goes as well as planned, haha Gap and I are going to do it if we don't get dates.. I most likely won't, so I know I'm going as a turtle.. and I'm not sure about Gap though
I don't know.. all the girls I know, haha But seriously.. I'm not getting a date, It's not happening
Oh I do know.. I just don't know any girls to ask, haha..
What her? Haha.. hmm.. I don't know if she'd say yes.. How'd you know about her?. Completely kidding of course.. there are like.. zero girls in my English class...
It's alright, I fell asleep too :P
Yeah.. it's great to know
I didn't even notice that... but awesome!
Ummm.. possibly, it depends on what time it is..
Right well.. I think I'm going then.. some friends and I are going to meet there and then go to someone's house.
Yeah, I suppose
It's going pretty well, I've got the shell almost completed :P
I think I saw her too! I almost died, but in a good way :)
That it was :D
Yeah, I'm going to the talent show and the bus ride should be a lot of fun :)
Umm.. no, I'm at a party thing
Yeah, you still going to the talent show?. Well, maybe going
Well it'd be cool to see you there
Haha :)
Umm, like when exactly?
I could possibly get downtown in a little while, I'm not sure if I'll make it before it gets dark though :P
I mean, I can get downtown pretty quickly from where I am right now..
Hmm.. good movie But I don't want to be more awkward that usual Oh, and I like Hellogoobye now, thank you :P
Yeah, so, I'll see you at the talent show.
I miss them too.. :/. And you :P
It's going alright, just got shot a few times How are you doing?
It's great though :P  Here's Johnny!
It's at 7.. Sorry, I thought I had previously sent that message :P
Yup, really. I hope that doesn't deter you from going.
Awesome!. :D
No, she's at a church play for the night, I'm going with some friends.. Do you need a ride?
I might be able to get you a ride there
You sure?
Well, Andy's mom is taking us there, so I think she can take you too, if you need the ride.
No, I'm already at his house
Haha, alright. Your ride situation, though?. We're almost leaving.. so
Alright, I'm trying to see if it'll work out
I don't know if there are enough seats at the moment :/
Really?
Well am I still going to see you there?
Oh, okay. Awesome :)
Umm.. no :P
I know, you showed up in a perfect time.. oh, and sorry for today :P
But like.. after the talent show.. I don't know.. I made things awkward :/
Same here.. It may sound a little weird, but I was really nervous, like.. butterfly nervous
You can't even imagine how nervous you make me :/. Sorry, I'm lame
I get butterflies everytime I'm around you, even when I'm just thinking about you.. or just talking to you via facebook, kinda just like now.    And it's okay, I've done the same :P
Snow would be fun :)
That would be epic :D
Me either.. I don't even know where to get the top hat, that's been my problem :P
Yeah, haha.. two different ones.. I'm sorry that in the future that I mix-up conversations. Hi! :) Sorry if I'm a bother; just wanted to say 'hello' :P
Unicorns are pretty cool :) I like the.. corn they have. How goes it?
It goes pretty good, I got shot up pretty badly today :P But it's going better and better every second now :)
I was playing rockband without face protection.. haha. So much fun :). Psst..  Wait, sorry.. nevermind
Oh.. I just wanted to say "Hey beautiful" but I couldn't think of a way to make it sound.. not creepy :P. Kind of succeeded either way though..
Phew.. I was worried that I was just being a loser :P
You're just saying that :P Anyway.. I thought what would be really cool would be to watch the lunar eclipse :) But then it turned out it started at around 1:30 am
Yeah I forgot to wake up for that meteor shower :P But for this eclipse if it wasn't so early then it'd be a beautiful thing to see with a friend, but it can't be done :P. Any who, how's it going?
It's going alright, I'm just putting off homework :P
Yeah, I haven't seen an eclipse either.. I heard it's like.. the second most beautiful thing out there :P
6 years doesn't sound like it'll take that long :P I'm kind of siked for the National Cheesy Pickup Line Day Random.. but you know :P
You should prepare for all the cheesy pickup lines thrown at you :P. Not from me, of course.. you get that enough as it is
I am not familiar with that one.. I need to brush up on cheesy pickup lines :P
Wouldn't you want to use the pickup lines on someone better?
(:
Okay, goodnight moon; sweet dreams
Pst.. and goodnight you when you're all I think about, all I dream about; how I could breath without.. :). Oh.. psht.. no.. I'm not talking about the song at all XD
Goodnight kiss from goodnight you :3 Yeah, I like it a lot
Yeah, see you then :) And I did say kiss :P Goodbye you amazing awesome-tastic person
Merry Christmas and Happy Festivus! I hope you have a good Christmas this year full of joy and eggnog :D
Festivus is a Seinfeld joke :D And that's awesome :) I just got home from my grandmothers :P
She does live near by, could stay too long because of the snow :P How was your Christmas day anyway?. couldn't*
Mine was alright, I got coal.. which was cool :D Other than that.. it was pretty average :P. Haha, I woke up late so I kinda have to practice on my own.. :P. Woops.. sorry, meant to send that to Gap :P
That would help.. and it's freezing outside, I couldn't feel my fingers when I got back to my house  that being said; good weather to go sledding :P
Yeah, and night sledding is the best :P
Sucha beautiful sight :3
Walking in a winter wonderland :)
I did, it was fun.. but my phalanges got cold so I didn't sled all that much :P. Random, but would you happen to be going to track practice tomorrow?
I am :P Not sure if it'll be as fun without you there, but I'll manage
Don't worry, I survived.. for now :P
Nah.. I would've made it boring :P
Umm nothing in particular
I do
Coolio :D
Haha, yeah.. I suppose. I actually have several sled-type things :P None of them are any good though
What a coincidence.. me too! But I don't use it all that much :P
I have a feeling my little sister used it more.. but if I had no other option.. I'd be all over that sled
I wish I had that shirt :P
I don't know.. It sounds crazy enough that it might just work
Oh thanks..I realized I lost it when it was too late :P I can get it at practice, thanks again.. Haha.. or you could give it to me at a later date.. give me a reason to say hi :P
Haha.. I liked the idea too, maybe I can just wear a different hat at practice today :P Yeah, happy New Years Eve!
I could try to say that I'm excited too.. but it already happened :P  Or say something in past tense.. but it was fun either way (:
Yes I am; sounds like a blast (:
Which ever time is better for you  Pizza eh? If you want :P I'm cool with whatever.. I'll just have to forget my wallet in my other pants. Jk of course, I'll be sure to not do that :P
Alright 7 o'clock and pizza Okay awesome; I'm really looking forward to it (:. Happy first day of the year! Had to say it a second time :P. Oh and.. 1. Eye, 2. Alike, 3. U, 4. Smile
Thanks, it wasn't that good :P
Yeah.. that's true. Who could love me? I am out of my mind. :P. 11:12 Wished for something awesome at 11:11 (:. Darn.. 11:13
Yeah.. it was a little random now that I think of it :P But I didn't miss 11:11.. the time was 11:13 when I said it was 11:12. But I still got to 11:11 on time to wish for something really amazing :)
I wished for what I always wish for :P
Unfortunately :P If only I didn't wish for what I wished for and wished for the pony  Just kidding, I prefer what I wished for over a pony.. any day. Oh and you were greatly missed at practice today :P
So.. maybe you should wish for me.. because I'm boring :P So that way.. it'll come true!
I'll just have to be more boring.. because I would want it to come true
But.. but.. I want the wish to come true :P
Well I'd like both of our wishes to come true.. and I don't know.. you could sorta wish that.. they'd shrink into an army man or something.
Why wouldn't you want that? I think that'd be pretty cool
That'd be cool too.. but creepy.. just a little?
Haha, you should.. it's serious business :P
Or.. amazing at them :D Well.. amazing at everything!
Or I'm not amazing in any way at all..
Or you're amazing and you're just trying to make me happy :P
Or neither of those statements are true :P
Fine.. how about.. we agree on me being "happy" and you being super amazing
.. Well I think your super amazing..  And "happy" is.. sarcastic happiness
Haha.. great, fantastic.  And I still don't know what the "rawr" means
Shucks :P
Haha.. Aww.. that photo of you got taken down :'(
I know.. it makes me sorta sad
Being sad tends to be bad at times
Umm.. yes.. indeed
Most indubitably
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
Yeah!! Good ol' Mary Poppins
I've seen bits.. Not all of it though
Yeah.. I mostly remember parodies of it
Well.. not really.. you?
Well, you didn't have plans prior to her saying "No." did you?
Yeah, prior means before :P Good thing she shot your question down.. doing something with me wouldn't be any fun
Dang.. that does sound like fun Darn. Oh well.. whatareyagonnado?
Which I'm perfectly fine with (:
It is :D If it keeps snowing.. that'd be nice
Ooo! That'd be cool
Me either.. my brother has an epic video of one he had on his phone
He showed me.. he threw a snowball, crashed into the fort/wall and someone hit him right in the snowball :P
It was! And snowballs come close :P It was pretty cool
Haha.. Just for a little while.. but then it'd stop :/
Haha, you're arm would eventually get tired.. I suppose that's why there are 2 of em
I like "amphibiousness" more
Good ol' spell check.. making every other word than the one you want
Yeah, it's the thought that counts
It looks so nice!  I wanna go play in it :P ... or run in it
Oo! I could do both :D
Haha, that would be awesome.. I can't remember the last time I played tag :P
It counts in it's own little, special, way :P
Shoot.. maybe all the peoples at track need to have a game of tag :P
I think so, but it's been a while
I am "awesome"  How are you?
Because I was using the word lightly :P. *sigh* took more time than I liked. Well.. I mean took longer than I would have liked.. if that's better English :P
It's not even finished :'( Most of the time was spent on a wild goose chace looking for miniature figurines Then we had to get the board printed out Then we had to cut it.. that's when I tore it up.. So, more work is needed to get it all done :/
Haha, I want more "bonding time" with you (:. I don't know if now is a good time.. but I'm pretty much free from now and later :P
Kinda sorta :P
You're an even cooler person!
That's impressive.. I didn't know I was that cool.
That's pretty epic :P Your umm.. super cute
Haha, thank you?
It's okay :P
I suppose :P
OO! I missed it But that's awesome for you :P
Yeah, haha It's fine though.. I wish for the same thing everytime.. and it hasn't happened yet :P  Not wishing this one time is fine :P
You may know what that same thing is.. and if there's something magic about today then I'll just have to wait until tonight to make a wish.   But... anyday I get to see you is a magical day :D
That's awesome.. I slept about.. 10 :P
The third reason is that I could ask you on a date or something :P The downfall on the third reason is that you could say no..
Haha, I see. And.. aww.. that thing's sad
A sick.. evil person :P
What makes it so good?
Well I hope it goes great.. even if your gut is wrong :P
Not everything your gut tells you will be a good thing :P
That is too much of a risk.. I don't think you should do it; you could die o.O. You're best bet is saying no.. it's got less letters in it
Aww, well.. if you really think I'm worth the risk.. then take it. But I wouldn't say that I am worth said risk :P
Who knows? Anyway.. maybe I'll see you at practice an whatnot :P. Or not.. because I wasn't able to make it :/
I feel less bad about not going then :P
Well.. I still have a 15 minute run to go on :P
Well.. that's cool still.. running alone isn't fun, but it's not.. not fun :P
Essentially
I don't get it...  jk :P
I couldn't tell.. I was in the movie theatre and was shot by John Wilkes Booth
I suppose so.. You could call me Honest Abe if that were my name.
Haha, even better!. Haha.. that's.. cute :D
Yeah.. Mr. Ramsey has kangaroo leather shoes.. he says the form with your feet and that they're super comfortable
Yeah.. I wish I had a pair
Well.. you'd be a very cute non-profit organization leader.. so that might count for something
I know.. I can't watch them.. because they're too sad
Haha, you're making me want to donate to the cause right now :P
I suppose so And yay! It's very exciting
Haha.. yeah. Except I am afraid I'm going to have to go to track practice today.. Instead of filming that project :P
Yeah.. that's true I'd still like to take off though. Oh well.. I guess it doesn't matter....
I guess it doesn't matter that I want to take off.. because it's futile :P
Possibly.. I don't know though I'd definitely be up for it though, because Back to the Future is my favorite movie and you're my favorite person
Hopefully I hope that I can though.. because it's a really good movie and you're a really awesome girl
Well.. I don't know if I'd make it that awesome.. but I can always try :P
Yeah.. I'm definitely going. Yup.. I should be going now
Awesome :D
Did you like that "awkward stand because I realized the door was locked" stand?
That's good to hear, haha :P Today was super fun
Well, you're really awesome too!
Umm umm umm?
Hello :D
Yeah, that. To which I would reply "I am fantastic. Just spent some time with this really amazing girl. How abour yourself?"
And then in shock I would say "Woah, that is quite the coincidence.". I think we got the whole "Conversation" thing down quite well :P
Yups I'd say goodnight.. but I fell asleep to early :P So good morning :D
Well thank you Good afternoon :P You're even awesomer :D
It's completely possible and you're welcome
I kind of feel the same way about you.. Sorry.. I was.. MIA for a little bit.. yeah see you :D
I'll try to, thanks (:. Rawr to you too.. sorry.. just got done with the filming :P
It went well.. It looks pretty nice I'm not done editing yet though :P
Me too! :D Just gotta get the editing done.. the conversion and the uploading :P
I actually didn't make any bloopers.. but that's because we made a music video
It was quite the adventure
I wish you could've been there
It would have been nice to see you in person (:. Sorry :P
How cool? jk.. I'll wait and find out
I can't wait.. it sounds.. so awesome.. Shucks.. okay :P
Sorry to bother you again Haha.. I did.. because it's unfortunate that you won't be in my dream tonight :/ Maybe you will anyways :P G'night again. Remember what?
You're cuter than the puppies and unicorns :D Sorry again.. you're probably tired of that.. buh bye. You remember what it was?
psst.. I knew it would happen :P
Eh.. I'm not sure I remember :P
Well.... shhhh... pahhh.. maybe just a little? Nah.. just kidding.. you're random and you spice things up, one trait that I like about you :D. I like let downs :D
I don't have a clue. I'm as far as I can go down.. I think I could manage..
Awesome.. can't wait. Basically :P
... ha.
Don't be. ... okay
Be prepared to be pretty worried. Sorry
... I'm prepared.. but I doubt it'll happen
Pretty much..
Good for you... at least one person should.
Nah... my faith in that field has run dry :P
I sure hope so, haha
That's neato.. I suppose :P
I saw you too yesterday! Would you like to possibly see me again today?  or you know.. not :P
Whoa.. my favorite movie!
No.. but if I happened to watch it with you.. I may learn to love it (:
Haha, I'm sorry if you don't like it all that much..
Haha.. I'm not sure of how positive of an influence I am anymore XD
I was just kidding :P It's a great movie.. just oldish I suppose?
Haha.. me too..  sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong decade :P
Like.. Edward Cullen. But sparklier.. and way more attractive ;)
Like.. Bergasaurus! XD Sorry.. that was a little mean...
It's quite the phenomenon :P We could find a bunch of vampires when the sun stops hiding behind the clouds :P
They could be me o.O
Haha.. yeah.. It's sucha bad taste in music :P
I listen to just about everything though :P Said The Whale, The Killers, Keane, Led Zeppelin, you name it :P
Basically.. and some exceptions to rap.. the rapper has to be pretty good
Psht.. he's white.. he can't be considered good XD
Was I kidding?
Good or bad memories? Like.. hurting your momma? Cleaning out your closet?
So it reminds you of standing up?. Wait a second.. do you mean to tell me.. you're the real Slim Shady?!?
That's.. crazy. You and your pretty eyes keep me alive (:
Unfortunately I can't take credit to the lyrics written by Alex Goot. The closest lyric that comes close that I've written is "I'm lost in your eyes, and I can't find the door".. not as good And I'm not certain that you have :P
Thank you Yours are very pretty as well.. actually, prettier
Well.. if I get to see yours, then there will be no problem you seeing mine
I don't know.. I'm pretty sure I've been helping out
Well I like yours.. they sound cute and stuff
They probably sound cute because of who says them.. and no.. sorry, not hard at work :P
I need studying XD And do I rock? because right now.. I don't think I do :P
So a star-shaped rock.. I rock more than that? whoa.. I think my mind is blown..
Whoa!.. that's.. crazy stuff I wish I knew what to say to that :P Would you mind if I said you were cute?. Oh.. I've been wasting my time listening to this song: It's cute.. :P almost like you Sorry.. 
Yay! (: I like it, it's really nice
I wish I could be as cute as that song.. :P The very least I wish I could write a song like that XD
Aww.. you're just saying that
Well, thank you! (: I think you're adorable
It means that I like you.. and that you think I'm awesome
Yeah! Thank you for that.. and he had hippopotamus dentures :P
He probably chopped the cherry tree with his teeth :P
Then he chucked it like a woodchuck :P
Just the one tree :P
Hmm.. Well he had a country to run :P
Good point.. too bad George was president after the revolutionary war and there was more than just 13 colonies :P
Unfortunately I haven't a clue I kind of want to say there weren't any more colonies
I can't wait to unfortunately not see you :P (like.. you'll be there, and I just so happen to miss you some how :P) But yeah, good luck, not that you need it And good night, sweet dreams
I'd say.. hmm.. it sounds like he wants to get to know you. Probably get to know you well..
Yeah, I'm not good in this field of expertise. area* not field :P
You too :D
Actually, rescheduled to an earlier time. I got done earlier, but I was still stuck in Radford until 6. Then there was youth until 8. Then went grocery shopping. So, I just got home XD
Nothing :'(
Okay.. I sat.. and I circulated oxygen into my lungs and emitted CO2.. but other than that.. pretty much nothing
Nah.. my little sister was sleeping and my other sister was wondering around
What would have happened if I crashed really badly on the huckleberry? Then I really wouldn't have been with them :P
Nah.. People would be like "where is that.. kid?" "Oh.. he's in the hospital" "Oh.. okay"
Nah.. they'd be in school and worry over school stuff
I'm pretty sure that their parents wouldn't allow that to happen
It didn't sound creepy But I still don't think that would happen.. I'd just be in the hospital and then I'd leave and everything would be back to normal
I doubt it... :P
I'll just have to listen to find out then :P. I see what you mean (:. I liked it :P
Awesome! And.. you logged out :/. Oh well.. :P
What's even more unexpected is that it closed! :D
Awesome :D I kind of stayed awake the second time I woke up :P
Why wake up earlier? Sleep is so awesome
How could you waste it.. if you were sleeping?!? :D
Well.. sure other things would be okay.. but sleep is pretty beast :D. But.. sorry, for saying "brb" and not coming back soon enough I really didn't think it would take that long.. looks like I was wrong.
Dreaming :P
Psht.. like there is anything in life that you can't have in a dream :P
See.. that sounds better than real life :D
But like.. there'd probably be a black market of snacks.. because of all the people who own the slolen vending machines
Better than drugs
Imagine someone smoking a dorito :P
Or cool ranch :D
Ha.. wow.. yeah. It could end hunger
Yeah! The best part is I don't think you could get cancer from it :P
I was about to mention that :P
Great minds think alike :D
It can't be much worse than mine :P
Well.. yours is cute.. if brains can be cute.. :P
That's one cute brain :P And I never actually got yogurt.. I ate some wasabi though :P
That's what I was told before I ate it :P
There.. wasn't a taste.. just heartburn XD
It was amazing.. so good I almost cried :')
Definitely :D As beautiful as you
I suppose you should be.. you'll never know when I'll turn them on you........... yeah :D
:3 I like you too (:
Yeah, it's just missing ears.. and whiskers :P
Haha, yeah :P  ^-^    Meow.. ( 00 ) / ( (  ) )
I tried.. really hard making it :D
I like your bunny :D It's cuter :P
Well.. it's still really nice :D
It was a dragon :D
Those are horns :D
Yeah! :D. I can't believe you could tell :P
Nope.. that's just a circle on it's tummy :D
It's okay though. Because you were pretty close
That.. and some brownie points :P
Maybe I should bake some :P
I'll do it :D
It'll just take.. a little bit to mix it.. then.. an hour to bake :P
But then they'd be all gooey an' yummy :D
Maybe.. I can try to make both of those happen
I know.. I'm not sure.. if I'm skilled enough though
Just.. not skilled in brownie making :P
I don't.. that may be how mine don't turn out good
Only not :P
Most of the time :P just not when it's me
Well.. one of these days you may know :P
Exactly!
That they are
Same here.. unless it's chocolate
That's.. extremely true. :D
I see that And so far.. it's a pretty nice sunny Sunday. Speaking of.. time to have some fun in the sun on this Sunday at my youth group :P
That has got to be.. the second cutest thing I've ever seen. You being first. Sorry.. anyway.. I hope today was very eventful and nice (:
That's interesting.. mine was.. eventful but uneventful at the same time :P See you then :D  Haha, I kind of wish I talked to you more today :P
Haha, why would you say the second thing? But yeah.. the day has been lacking in "How are you?"
I'm really great because I learned something that was really neat :P
This girl I like likes me back
Don't worry, I didn't walk... I ran XD But yeah.. if I loved seeing you.. kind of a let down when I only got an "air hug" But yeah.. goodnight, sweet dreams and see  you tomorrow :D. No "if"* sorry I was typing "if I wasn't so tired" but I took it out except for "if" :P. It's a Christian song.. and I'm not sure if you'd care too much about it.. but I think it's nice. I don't know if I'm off base here.. but am I bothering you at all? Because I can just lay low if that's the case.
Yeah, my cousin showed it to me.. I wasn't too sure if I'd like it.. but it reminded me of someone.. so I thought it was pretty nice
Oh, okay.. I was just checking.. I didn't want to make a fool of myself if it was the case :P
Well, okay.. I suppose that's good to hear :P And that song sounds really nice :D Way better than the one I wrote :P
Oh, it's not just lyrics anymore.. I have an actual song now. My lyrics to music.. but it's not all that great.. I mean, I like it, but that's just because I understand the work it took. And my self-criticisms are like.. always accurate :D Like.. I can't write lyrics, I can't sing, nor am I attractive :P
I meant I can't write good lyrics.. and my singing is mediocre at best.. and you're just saying that :P. And I was actually listening to that song in the hallway :P. Speaking of song.. I think I finished recording the vocals.. which aren't any good :P Anyway.. you always seem really busy during 10 minute break.. so if you don't want me to hang around you then, I'll just go straight to class and I won't bother you
Okay, just checking.. because I didn't want to bother you or anything.. because I think you're really cool (:
I'm fairly certain.. And if I don't sound like a total creep by saying this, I'd like to add that you're also the prettiest girl in school.
Sorry.. but I find that to be true.. but.. yeah Goodnight, sweet dreams  (I think I finished the song :P.. like officially)
I'm pretty sure I'm the.. just kidding.. yeah, Country-style gravy is pretty awesome :D
Either way I'm not amazing :P And, aren't we in the south? Not south south, but still south.. I don't know, I'm just stupid.. :P. Any way.. it's almost Valentine's Day :P. Aww.. I forgot about that Poetry Slam :/ I was going to go :P
That's a good point.. :P Oh? do you already have yourself a Valentine?
I'm not the "Valentine" type of guy.. so I don't.. nor do I think I'll get a Valentine :P And cheesy poems are really fun :D
I was actually wondering..  nevermind Yeah.. so how's your day been?
Mine was.. alright.. kind of.. lacking Or.. lacking of a certain someone :P But.. I suppose it was good, I wrote another song today.. It's.. not any good :P Oh, I was kind of wondering.. sorry.. again :P  If you don't already have someone in mind Would you be my Valentine? Someone as pretty and kind I never thought in the world I would find Such a sight for sore eyes :P. That's my cheesy poem :P And yeah.. that essay is probably really important an' junk
I was wondering exactly what the poem asked :P. Sorry :P
Disappointing.. I know.. I'm sorry...
Well I assume it's not that fantastic either.. so.. just forget what I said.. I'm sorry
I don't know.. I feel like it's as disappointing as finding out that I like you.. so, I apologize.. I was actually thinking about asking you tomorrow.. but I'm not sure if I'd get a good responce.
I suppose I'll just have to find out tomorrow.. unless you don't want it to happen..
Oh.. I see.. I know what you mean.. it's kind of tough for myself; standing next to the prettiest girl at school an' all..
Of course.. Why wouldn't I be?
I think you do.. but I'm pretty biased, because I like you. Oh well.. see you tomorrow? Ten minute break possibly? I mean, if you want to..
Of course I like you.. It's kind of hard not to. And goodnight, sweet dreams (:
It's very probabable.. because you're extremely pretty, funny and a bunch of other amazing stuff.. you're an amazing girl. And maybe I do.. but that doesn't mean that I didn't fall head over heals the first day I saw you Sorry :P Night (:. probable* wow.. so much of a fail.. and I just noticed :'(
That's awesome, just like you :D
If you need someone to watch it with you, I can always be there :P. if you want :P
It's fine that I can watch it with you? Or that you don't want me to?. Because I'd like to be there with you, but I can find somewhere else to be :P
I was going to watch it either way.. and I would prefer to watch it with you.. but if you don't want me to be there, that's cool.. I don't want to bother you or anything
Aww.. shucks.. oh well.. tear drop :P I think the Steelers will win, however I'm not rooting for anyone in particular..  Well.. looks like I need to find something to do.. because my family left to a party.. so I'm pretty much alone :P Anyway.. have fun :D. *sigh* haha.. sorry wow.. :P
It's okay.. I'm alone for a majority of the time, it's not like today will make a difference.. Yeah.. so you have fun (: I'll just.. stay here and try and see if anyone is available :P
Hello there! How are you?
I'm doing fairly well (: Sleep is good, however I had no time.. I've been working on a painting
Yes it is that painting.. it's looking alright so far
I hope so too.. however I'm probably not getting a good grade on it :P
It's a completion grade that is given when it's due.. and it was due Friday
Maybe she'll accept my "I was at track" excuse
Yeah, she didn't.. but I'm still getting a 95 :) So.. that's good
Yeah.. I'm pretty glad I brought it in today I was about to just leave it
It's an inconvenience.. but it's okay
Maybe I need more paintings :P
Maybe.. that could be it.. just hand out doughnuts to make people happy
What awesomeness? if anything I'm just radioactive
You see it because I'm always near you when you do So it's actually just your awesomeness shining on me
I really like that idea (:
I don't know.. you're a lot brighter.. and prettier. than me*
So you're brighter and prettier than both me and the sun (:
To quote Pedro Hernandez.. "When I see your face there's not a thing I would change, 'cause girl you're amazin' just the way you are" And you're just super pretty and amazing and stuff
Me too, because that means I get to spend time with you.. which is always a blast :D
Yeah, I would feel the same way if you didn't want to see me at all..
Then we'd both be in a slump :P
Good thing that's not the case, that way it's super cool :D
Yeah, looks like I was wrong :P. This is really random.. but I was watching clips from the movie.. and this popped up :P
Might detour you from watching it.. but I thought it was nice :P
Does that mean I owe you a soda?
Do I owe you anything?
Possibly.. I guess it depends on what that thing is
Oh, in that case.. it most likely happened
I don't know.. I feel like I've said that I've wanted a Roxanne in my life :P And thank you. You too; tonight was awesome :D
Erm.. what did you imagine? And yeah.. you were awesome :D
Haha, okay :P And yeah, really awesome (:
It probably will be as awesome, as long as I'm with you (:
Even "awesome-er" I've never actually done "Valentines Day" it'll be.. weird :P But I guess "good" weird :D
I haven't seen it either.. Gap has, he said it was alright :P And yeah.. do everything in one night :D.. or not, that may prove difficult
Haha, I like the way you think :P And we should watch it.. together (:
It was probably just Back to the Future that made it fun :P
That could be it, haha I think watching it with you made it better than when I watched it before
Maybe you should try it? :P
You can borrow mine :D
Well.. maybe I can be there, but I just won't watch it :P
Good point :P I'll probably be too busy thinking about you to be able to play it over in my head
You're worth all my thought space, but then I'd forget some important stuff
Yeah, it's just so... important :P
haha, yeah :D You're pretty important yourself (:
It totally is.. n't
haha.. I'm not that crazy
You're right.. I'm that crazy :P
Phew.. I was worried for a second there :P
That's super cool! :D Rainbows and cake.. no better combination ever on the face of the planet
I was going to say the same thing :P
Haha, yeah :D I liked it coming from you though :P
(: You're really amazing I really^7 like you
Aw (: 9x-7i>3(3x-7u)
I could make it easy and say i<3u
Oh you're welcome :P Butterflies are weird.. but like.. a good weird :D
Me too.. I don't know why.. but it's just a good feeling
When you're like scared.. and your stomach shoots up?
Yeah, I'm awfully familiar with that feeling :P
Theme parks don't make me as nervous as you do :P And.. I'd like to say that I am now able to depart and make it to your house.. however.. I may take.. a very long time getting there :P
Yes.. tortoise :P No, I may have to stop and pick some stuff up on the way
Well.. that and I thought my mom wasn't here.. so I was going to walk.. turns out she is here :P. But yeah.. I'll be over when you like
(: Okay, awesome I need the vhs right?
I know exactly where it is.. but I suppose I can leave it where it is too :P Awesome, well.. I'll see you later (:
(: ! Hiii (:
You're super amazing! And yeah.. it was pretty out :P
Oh, yeah.. those darn magical elves :P I hope I'm better by tomorrow.. it was kind of boring here and I kinda of missed you
I suppose I'm feeling.. better-ish.. kind of feeling dead but you know.. talking to you is making everything better (:
Kind of.. zombie dead :P And that would be nice of you.. but you don't have to waste a wish on me
I know what you mean.. the hope that my wish to be magical is kind of fading away :P
Maybe.. someday... When I'm with you; a spark between us will be so magical.. that.. I don't even know what I'm saying; I'm completely worn down :P
What message.. I cannot follow whatsoever. ?
Oh.. I wish I knew what it meant too :P
Oh like.. in that case.. it's like, I wish for it.. but it never comes true.. so like, my hope for that to come true is fading :P. I don't know what I'm saying, I'm sorry
That's a nice prospect on things.. I do believe, but like it's hard sometimes
Maybe you would be a bad Dr. Phil/Oprah.. but I like you the way you are (:
Me too (: You're just so amazing
You should believe it all the time, because you are truly amazing (: And I have some of them on vhs, I don't know if that's convenient or not :P
Hmm.. I wish mine still worked But I think Gap has one that does.. Still unsure of the convenience
I mean the convenience of a VCR :P
Haha.. it would probably so much fun you'd forget that you're rewinding something
Haha, me too.. that was back before I knew a lot about computers though :P
No I mean.. before I did cool stuff and played outside.. now I confine myself to a screen
I don't think anyone else would think that would be fun
We could play hide & seek.. but then I'd get lonely
Well.. I kind of feel better now, like.. as of 3 hours ago :P And if you want to bring soup.. I suppose you can?
Hmm.. I don't know :P I still have a cough and everything, but I don't feel as bad as before :P
You don't really have to do anything :P
I know what you mean.. it felt nice out :P even though it's dark outside.. the sky is really pretty too (:
Yeah, and I hear it's only supposed to get nicer (:
It's just so bipolar :P But yeah, I hope it's nice Friday; it would be a good day to something fun :P
Oh, really? That's really awesome.. I just found out today :P
Yeah! You're just so amazing like that :D Like.. amazing in other ways too.. but still (:
Umm.. you could take it as a failed attempt at a compliment :P
It's fine.. you didn't miss much... I was alone for a majority of the time because they told me not to run (my knee had to do with that) So I sat there for a long time until everyone was done.. But yeah.. thought I recognized the orange car :P. So.. I'm going to assume what I wrote didn't send.. and paraphrase by saying.. it's okay I barely ran because of my knee anyway.. and sitting alone wasn't so bad :P. Never mind.. I was wrong :P. Umm.. umm.. goodnight (: ? Sorry
My Friday is going slowly.. but I suppose it can't be that bad :P I'm no longer feeling miserable and my cough has either died down or left entirely.. so that's nice (: I hope that you have a fantastic day doing.. stuffs :P. :D
That they are.. unless you're cooped up at home alone :P
Quite possibly.. but it's whatever; nothing to worry over :P
That sounds amazing.. like.. I didn't read one thing that couldn't be awesome
I am.. however.. I'm stuck here
Essentially.. that or I could walk
That's true.. but you're worth it (:
Woah.. I was worried that I was quite the opposite :P But you.. you're awesome :D
No, that was fine.. I thought it was cute :3
Haha, I'll be fine with that name, I guess. :P I can't come up with nicknames like you
Well, it's still cool :P Being "Peter-ish" is to be someone who runs away :P I suppose it's fitting
Haha, that's.. pretty awesome. I feel like you don't need a nickname, because you're amazing just the way you are
He should have never of written that song.. because now I can't just casually say that :P
I don't think I ever needed to use those exact words before :P
You have this thing about you.. that just makes me melt whenever you say something like that :3 I love your laugh and you're so cute all the time. Most of the time I can't really say what I want, but I try (I hope it works) And I think.. you're just the most amazing girl in the world.
That's good.. because I'd like to talk to you days on end. And I liked your charlieissocoollike reference.. it was really nice. You give me butterflies every time I look in your eyes and I gotta say that your super amazing (:
If only I were close enough for a hug.. I can always dream (:
I know what you mean.. I sometimes do that.. but like.. I don't want to sound creepy or anything, but I think of you... that probably sounds really creepy.. I'm sorry
Okay good.. we can just be creepy together then :D
:3 I really really like you too.. and it might be tough going to bed with butterflies.. but I can always try. You're just soooooooo amazingly-perfect-awesome.. or supermeganfoxyawesomehot (From the "A Very Potter Musical")
Yeah! Blaine I think.. it's really funny though and pretty good singing (: G'night even cooler person :D
Aww, I fell asleep before I could say "I feel the same way, but for you." (:  I hope you slept well :P
Good weird, bad weird or just weird weird? And you too! (:
It's because of me again.. I just know it :P Just kidding.. unless I'm completely right...
I remember my dreams a lot, they are very vivid And thank you.. I think that too.. but about you (:
They are in color :P And I think I've only had one nightmare before.. it was terrifying :P And if I thought it about myself that would be kind of narcissistic
Haha, well thank you. It's cool of you to say that. So.. I know this isn't the best idea... but I'm going to go on a run with my limp; I hope I don't get hurt :P But umm, you're really really amazing an' stuff (:
It was pretty fun.. however I may have hurt my other leg haha
Yeah, it was a nice run :P I mean.. prior to the run I hurt my right ankle.. then I may have pulled my quad the other day.. so I'm just completely messed up :P
Haha.. is it bad of me to have read the whole thing? I kind of feel that anything from you is sort of important, so I felt the need to do so :P But um.. I like you too (: fo sho  You're awesome
Haha, well.. maybe you're just crazy :P Just kidding, you're crazy amazing too (:  Word.
Haha, you're silly.. but in a good way, you know.. like, cute silly :3
I'm also "cripple" :P Yeah, how's your day been so far?
My day has been good.. I haven't really done much though :P And if you want some Fruit Loops.. I can totally run some over to your house
I do, haha
That's a good idea. I've never actually tried that before, but I think I might have to go do that :P
I'll keep weights around then to prevent them from tipping over :P
I thought so too :D However.. I kind of decided on just eating the fruit loops :P
That's a nice little tidbit of information  And it's okay.. I used my time unproductively :P
It.. wasn't all that much fun :P But.. yeah :P
I am very sorry about that. Never mind.. I feel a little relieved saying it :P
Alrightie then.. good night (: You're really cool
I should be at some point.. but it's iffy as to when. I just have a little bit of work to do, and then yeah.. I should be free (:
Yeah, completely weird.. but it's a weird that I'm completely fine with
Haha.. you saw that too?
Yeah, that was really nice :D He's a really cool like guy
I think you're super duper amazingly awesome.. if that's not redundant :P
Haha, thanks.. I think you've got me beat, but you're still really awesome either way (:
I have a pretty cool dental person :P. Umm.. how's your day been?
Mine was spent mostly doing nothing at Gap's house And cool sealants sounds cool, I'm supposed to get spacers tomorrow :P All in all, my day has been alright, but not spectacular
Thank you for the advice.. and that sounds like some book :P Oh.. I just got in from being Waldo.. or "Wallace," as I would claim myself to be. It wasn't so bad for the first bit of time.. but I got annoyed with the staring and the "I found you" or "There you are!" really quickly.. Not that you needed to know any of what happened in my day or anything :P
Well someone had a last minute project that they needed help with.. so I just dressed up to help him out :P
A spanish video :P
Haha.. he never said that, but that would have made it a lot funnier  I'm glad I still know Spanish, or else I would have just been in a blank :P
I'm sure you'll do great in it. Plus, won't you get Senior Opazo?
That's true.. but I'm sure you'll be awesome, because you are at all times anyways
Maybe I should? Even though it'd be hard to do and that's good that you don't.
It was President's day.. and it was a nice one :P And I would never do that, that's awful.
Yeah, I didn't learn all that much that I didn't already know :P And *pet* peeves.. sounds like an unintentional joke :P
And that isn't very funny.. at all.. ever, but the play on words was pretty close
Really now? I guess I could see why you would laugh at that.. because of the pure randomness of it :P
Yeah, I completely understand what you're saying :P
Trouble understanding what I'm saying?
Oh.. well I say a lot of gibberish for a majority of the time :P
Or.. not at all.. well, maybe meaningful, but not of "genius"
They did and that's nice of his eyebrows? And I totally need to know these random things about you.. I'll get to know you better in a way (:. So like.. I just got back.. but like, was that a short practice?
Oh, that makes sense :P And knowing you better would help me to not be such a dork in the future (:
Nah.. I'm a total dork :P If anything I could get less dorky
I wear glasses though.. Anyway... I may have underestimated how long I'd be out, sorry and I'm not that cool :P. Umm, I don't know if you'll get this until tomorrow, but.. goodnight (: Sweet dreams!
Well.. it's too late for me to say good morning, so.. good afternoon (: I hope you had a fantastic day!. Flash forward I'm here in my car Did we lose it? Or is this the start I tried to fight it Now look where we are Together, alone With two beating hearts  The moment Seemed to go too fast The emotion And good times to be had You could spend it Here with me Or you could forget it  Like it were history  Just wanted to let you know My feelings for you seem to grow Every day that I see your face I hope your heart has the same aftertaste   You linger Even when you're not there It's quiet  I know it's not fair  But when I see you I go into a trance My heart beats fast I hope it's not bad That I want this to last Don't change your mind It's just fun to be had   Sorry, if that was really lame.. I just thought I'd share it with someone :P
Sorry, I checked out early today.. I planned to, but forgot about my doctors appointment :P Good night again :D And totally.. I write just like her :P Which.. in some aspects could be a good thing?
Oh, like me.. because I need glasses :D And relating to teenage females helps so much :P
Oh, no.. it's really beneficial.. considering I'm a guy.. and I don't have the best of luck with females :P
Oh no, totally lucky because of you liking me  and you're cool and female.. so maybe you're just an exception
Sorry.. didn't mean to.. but maybe that's a good thing?
Yeah, that's true :P So basically.. you're saying you can't argue that I think you're super pretty and amazing?
Well me either.. so in comparison, you are all that cool :D
That was my favorite show as a kid :D
I remember a lot of it.. and then there was Kenan and Kel :D
Kenan and Kel came out after All That :P And that's so true, much better than the ones out now
I know.. especially with the dancing lobsters and Totally Kyle :P I miss shows like that.. Drake and Josh was the last survivor.. but it's gone too :'(
Yeah, that's what I meant.. I've seen all of those episodes.. but I probably don't remember All That and Kenan and Kel enough that I couldn't rewatch the episodes over again :P
Yeah.. I might just have to find the episodes.. or Good Burger I still haven't seen that, unfortunately
Good Burger was the movie that All That made.. Kenan and Kel were the stars.. I just wish I watched it :P
That would be really awesome, I'd really like that. I've only seen the Good Burger skits.. so yeah. That would be really cool (:
I know what you mean.. where does the time go?
That is a crazy theory.. but I accept it 100%
Yeah, totally! Who needs those laws anyway?
Me either.. which just proves how much you don't need them all the more :D
Wait... we aren't made up of the 5 natural elements?!?  Everything I've been told is a lie!! :'(
Yeah.. but it looks like I was wrong all these years :/
Yeah.. it must've hit them hard I bet they cried so much once they found out.. Kinda like I did :P
I don't know.. there's so much love in this heart of mine that I think there is a blazing fire inside (:
Totally! I do that all the time.. I also use it to keep warm.. I just hope it doesn't go out any time soon :P
I know! I can't let down the charmanders; they're counting on me!!
Yeah, if I were to chose a Pokemon.. it'd be a charmander :D
Don't worry.. I'll keep pressing the b button :P
That might be it.. I haven't played pokemon in a while.. so I forgot :P
Well.. why don't I just grab my gameboy and play it right now? That way it won't be so bad if you just remember
I wish I had a pokewalker :P It'd be like.. so cool to be training just by walking around
Haha it's cool that he does that :P I feel like.. I should just set off on a journey with my best friend and some random girl that I bump into at the beginning of it
Yeah! I can't wait  I just need some girl that really likes me.. so that she just follows me around the Cantoe (sp?) region
Haha, yeah.. It might be Kanto.. but I don't know And that was a pretty nice movie (:
Yeah.. I got worried.. because he's just another dog.. but I realized, he's not.. he's a dog that loves Penny! And super powers or not, that made him super :P
Yeah.. it's probably the most powerful thing you could have.. and if used correctly love can save the world (:
They were pretty amazing.. (:
It's not like I'm a witch :P It's really okay (: and I really liked seeing you today!. Well.. I hope your day was as good as mine.. because that would mean your day was pretty amazing (: Anyway.. good night and sleep well
That's good to know that I'd be a good witch :P But yeah.. you made my day the best day that I've lived so far (: I was even thinking of that song 'Must Have Done Something Right' on the way home :P You're so amazing :D
Because you're amazing; that's how you could make such an impact.. but I seriously must have done something right, because you're so amazing and it's really nice having you in my life. And I don't care that I got soaked on the way home.. it was all worth it
Me too. I was kind of scared to send the message :P But I'd say it's worth it, because it made you smile; which is super awesome (: You're.. you're just really really awesome.. I'm really glad I met you. (: See you then!
Haha.. my smile isn't that great :P But yeah, I feel the same way (: but about you :P And that was pretty funny stuff.. I liked the facebook song one :P
Well.. if you find it amazing and it makes you happy.. then I should be pretty darn happy that I've got a smile like that :P I still have to say that I like yours more (: And yeah, it's a lot like autotuning the news.. if you don't know what that is; the guys autotuned Antoine Dodson and the double rainbow guy :P (: Goodnight and sweet dreams. My dad decided no all together for walking.. so I couldn't drop by :/
Yeah, it's cool stuff And don't apologize, I feel the same way.. but about you. You're just so amazing (:
Well you should believe it, because it's true (: And yeah.. I'm going to try to be :P
"Seeing is believing" is nice I suppose.. I guess I haven't been able to give much proof, so I'm sorry for that. And isn't Bootstrap one of the good guys?
Right, well that stuffs pretty believable..  And yeah.. he did look creepy like that; it's nice he had a happy ending though (:
I would say you're crazy.. there couldn't be anything called the "United Nations," however, I completely agree about the green creeps I like happy endings, but they don't happy that often for me :P
Haha, I know what you mean :P And everyone? Even me?
Whoa.. crazy.. I didn't think I deserved a happy ending :P
Haha, alright.. Well, goodnight! My day was okay, and I hope the same for yours (: I hope that the snowboarding was fun!
I probably couldn't be much better :P And that it does.. it's crazy how that works out :P. See you then :D
Whoa.. when did you see me?. Like.. in context I wouldn't like.. know.. did you see me at school-stuffs? Or like.. randomly after?
Oh, okay :P How was your lock-in experience?
I wasn't at school during the lock-in.. so I can't really tell you about my lock-in experience :P And awesome, I bet you're super awesome at it by now :P Anyways.. have a great time! I'll talk to you later
Well you're still probably better than me You looked very cute either way and I couldn't tell But I'd be willing to do that :D I wanted to ask you if you'd go to that Faraday Cage concert with me earlier.. but then I found out you were going snowboarding, but it's okay, I'll find someone else to go :P Anyways.. Have a great day and have a load of fun! (:
Haha, well I wouldn't say I'm amazing at anything And maybe! :D But it was a good time. The opening band was loud.. but Faraday Cage was pretty good and don't worry.. a bunch of cameras were there to capture the moment.
I'm pretty terrible with just about everything I do :P And that'd be cool! Oh.. would you happen to be going to practice tomorrow? [Sorry, random]
It is at the weight club.. I'm not sure if I should because of my knee.. and maybe you could sit it out because of the falling? And maybe.. just maybe.. we could do something amazing together?
I may possibly be suggesting that.. but it's alright if you find that to be a dumb idea :P
See? You have an excuse!! :D And my "excuse" is that we're doing lower body and my knee still isn't working :P
It's probably fine.. it just tightens up when I run :P And I saw, it was nice-ish :P
Yeah, it's not that great, but the rain was :D
Maybe a Gap full of cucumbers?
I don't see why he wouldn't :P
Haha.. I suppose that is pretty awesome :D. I hope you didn't get in trouble for anything.. because I could'v easily walked home :P I also regret not saying what I wanted to say.. but anyway Goodnight an' stuffs (:
Okay, that's a relief.. I was kind of worried an' stuff But yeah, same here.. I felt really weak in the knees.. I almost thought I was going to fall right over :P And I really would like to tell you what I wanted to say.. but I'm uncertain if I'd be able to manage the words off my tongue :P Sorry.. Maybe I can say it to you some other time we meet up? G'night and sweet dreams (:
It's pretty important in my opinion :P You too! (:
I think you're absolutely right! About Demetri Martin :P It could probably wait.. but I'm not sure if I want it to :P
I miss that show.. even though I'd only watch it occasionally.. and maybe it could help :P
Haha.. I gotcha :P That's one crazy song..
Why would my presence change the craziness to that song?. of* that song?
I'm not sure if I do know why :P Anyway.. looks like I gotta go to that movie thingy..  If you'd like to show up randomly it's at 1543 Mt. Tabor Road (Slusser's Chapel) at 6:15.. but you don't have to :P Either way, bye and have a good afternoon! (:
I am pretty sure.. it's held in the youth room, and I'm part of the "youth".. it's also a family thing and we were told to invite some people.. it's also a "bring your own snack thing" but I can bring plenty :P It'd be really cool to see you there.. but again.. you don't have to show up Anyway.. I gotta go set up :P Bye
Hmm.. I'm not certain as to how I'm going to respond.. Umm.. the movie was pretty good.. but it was pretty much exactly like The Family Man.. maybe with some Scrooged and It's A Wonderful Life thrown in there :P I hope your day was super! (:
It is pretty far away.. it's cool that you got to do that though :D But tomorrow (technically later today) should be cool (: I hope at least.. yeah goodnight! Sweet dreams (:. I may have gotten pretty bruised up on that walk home of mine.. not that you'd care or anything :P Anyway.. I hope your day went well.
Nope.. My knee didn't bend all the way when I walked up this hill.. so long story short.. I fell... But I'm okay. I think. Anyway.. good night I suppose?
It wasn't safe.. at all.. I just.. needed it :P Walking with someone would have been safer though.. but why would anybody walk nowadays? but yeah, see you tomorrow.. tomorrow is club day, right?
I heard there are two this month :P  One tomorrow and another as a "make-up" But I don't know.. maybe my agenda was lying to me, such a lyre :P
You're even better! (: Sorry.. yeah, I wish I could play too :P
You're not sure what I'm better than?  I'm glad you finally see it, because I'm not better than anything :P
Nah.. I feel pretty far from awesome...
I think you've got that covered :P
It was alright.. I'm scheduled for an MRI now; to check if I tore my miniscus or not.. I also got a haircut, afterwards.. which I didn't want.. but oh well :P How was the ab work?
I hope my knee is alright too.. I'm really hoping that, if they have to do anything, the surgery isn't too bad  And it'd be cool if you saw me and my haircut pretty soon :P Or not.. seeing me isn't that important. You might just have to wait :P
Well.. if that something can't wait.. I'll run to the ends of the earth (counterintuitive, I know) but if not.. you can always tell me tomorrow? And I feel like there's a high probability  getting surgery.. but there are two possibilities; one is minor and the other will cause me to need crutches for a while :P. I saw this video.. and it made me think of you :P Anyways.. I hope your day was fantastic.. good night and sweet dreams :D
Yeah, but it's fine.  And I hope your day was and still will be amazing :D  Aw.. looks like I'm going to my church to help with that banner I designed :P So I'll talk to you later (:. Oh, and I hope the whole orthodontist thing went well
Haha, they are so cute!! :D So are you :3  I mean, it's okay you don't have to tell me tomorrow :P  Unless somehow you manage to get alone with me :P But it's fine if not.. anyways.. yeah.. I didn't really help much, I designed it, but I tried to learn how to juggle the entire time. I got the hang of it, but I'm still no good.  And your teeth must be pretty nice then :P Goodnight and see you tomorrow :D
You shouldn't disagree, it's true (: And I'd say it's fine if you don't tell me, I guess. Also.. juggling is pretty tough.. so I'm still no good.. but I've got the mechanics down :P. Hey, I hope that your day was and still is fantastic! :D and I don't know who is going.. but I suppose I'll be off to One Acts.. I hope it's good :P Anyways, you're super cool (:
Or.. not I think they just left :P. Yup, they are gone.. well.. darn :P Now I don't have anything to do :P
'They' as in my dad and sister.. my mom's not home..  and yet? Maybe you could find something to do :P. Haha, reminds me of the hellogoodbye song :P
That's just a silly thing to waste your friday on :P You should go out somewhere and do something cool :D
There are probably plenty of cool places to go to.. I unfortunately have no place to go because my friends are either seeing a movie or at One Acts.. Oh well.. maybe I could just make a sculpture out of electronics :P
I know what you mean, haha Movies and the SAT are overrated.. I'm going to have to sign up for the other one, because I forgot to sign up for the one for tomorrow :P
Don't be sorry, you're super amazing and.. I don't want to sound really creepy by repeating being obsessed, even though I may possibly be.. so I won't say it :P But like.. *dreamy sigh* :3 Oh, I wrote this.. about you.. kinda just now.. it's bad  You're so pretty And I'm so me I can't believe That this is happening  You're so funny And oh so cute I never know what to do Or what to say  When you come my way When you come my way Oh, all I could say Please don't walk away  You have my heart You've had from the start And it's not easy To let you in like this  But you're so pretty And I'm so me I can hardly breath Whenever I see  You're eyes They take me by surprise I love you in my life Thoughts of you lie/ in my head as I rest  Really corny I know.. I'm sorry :P. So like.. I think I forgot to say goodnight an' stuff..  So.. Goodnight!.. sweet dreams (:
You're really awesome in general (: I really really like you too! :D you're amazing!
It's fine.. I think it's cute :3 And I'll try to have fun tomorrow, but most likely I'll fall and get hurt :P anyways, I hope you have fun too :D
Yeah, not accident prone today.. I was just lucky; tomorrow might be a different story :P And the MRI is coming up, so only time will tell.. bye! bestest friend (:. So.. I hope you had a nice day today (:
It was really nice out today, but I spent it indoors :/ But it was still fun (: Didn't fall, so that's good :P The poem could probably be better though.. it just doesn't do you justice..
Like.. spent it inside the dark Adventure World.. I did go downtown for a lil' while :P Well.. it came from the heart.. I literally wrote it on the way home from your house. Sorry about that.. I feel sorta bad now
I'm in a large amount of trouble.. But I'm sorry about wanting a hug I suppose.. But yeah.. when it's warmer (:. Oops! sorry Meant to add a "jk" after "I'm in a large amount of trouble.."
Yeah, my bad.. it would've been worth the trouble though :D And I'm assuming that they aren't that nice.. Because you didn't want one and the ones from Tommy aren't nice... No offense to Tommy of course :P
I'm certain that you are amazing at them.. I fell asleep at 7:40 last night :P. Good Morning!
Nah.. I have a problem :P But I mostly forgot stuff in this room here.. and I figured that, since I have a major problem, that I'd turn on the computer to finish the homework I had.. and since I was already on.. why not go on facebook?
Obsessed with? Like Darren Criss? :P But I know what you mean.. I'm mostly on facebook for one reason :P But yeah! I can't wait :D. Hey!  sorry.. just wanted to say goodnight and sweet dreams (:
You're amazing too! (: But like.. I didn't say anything all that amazing that could give you butterflies.. I hope track is fun! (sorry about.. that thing) :P. Sorry again.. I hope track was nice and I hope you had a super amazing day! So.. goodnight and sweet dreams and I hope your day tomorrow is just as amazing or even better! (:
Well.. you're pretty amazing yourself :D and that's fantastic! My day is pretty chill so far.. oh and it's nice out (:
The very same :P  It's pretty nice here.. About to go to the concert, should be fun. I hope your day was nice!! And if I don't get the time to say it later then goodnight and sweet dreams! :)  Oh.. I'm in Fredericksburg, if you cared to know :P. The very same :P  It's pretty nice here.. About to go to the concert, should be fun. I hope your day was nice!!

I hope your day was nice!! And if I don't get the time to say it later then goodnight and sweet dreams!   . Sorry.. Super lag on my Zune   Must be annoying
Hasn't rained  here..  It's crazy though :P www.vasyc.com and you can see  it live o.O  Anyways, have a nice day  I get '' free time'' soon :P. Oh my goodness.. You're really cool! (:  . (I think it was The Day After Tomorrow..)  Sorry, I'll wait until Monday to talk again.. (or Sunday at Rita's if you're out that late)   :D. Not that it's very important or that you care at all.. but I had a safe trip home :P
(: it's fine I wanted to say that stuffs too, because you're like.. incredible and amazing.. and all this stuff. Awesome that you were out that late (: sorry though.. about all that stuff :P
Please see it? because it's true.. extremely true And you could've had that yo-yo if you wanted :P. I'm glad you got to too! It was nice seeing you (:. I doubt you were serious about Ben & Jerry's.. but it would've been cool :P
I really like the fact you wanted me to accompany you on the journey :D Another day is great (even if it's not sunny :P), I hope you have fun with the homework and have a really cool latter of the day (:
I kinda don't know why people hate Mondays so much.. this one was awesome.. School wasn't so bad, running was easy (for me at least), I got to walk with this super amazing girl who I extremely like, and I got to relax.. All in all, it was a pretty awesome day, I hope yours was even better though :D If the opportunity to talk to you any more today doesn't exist, I'd like to leave off with: goodnight, sweet dreams, and you're amazing (:. Sorry, but umm.. it was really nice being with you today (: I hope your day was fantastic and have a goodnight an' some sweet dreams (:. I.. umm.. hope your day is going well.. and I hope practice wasn't too difficult and I hope everything is super nice
Are you going to celebrate purple cupcake day?. Well like.. I hope everything for you is just.. amazing
Hi (: My day is going pretty well.. haven't done much though :P How is your day going?
That sounds pretty awesome (:
haha.. everything's better with nutella :D
Well.. seeing me can be arranged if you'd like (:
Well.. I'd like to see you again (:.. and I don't see why "being too soon" would be a bad thing.. but if you have better things to do then you know.. :P
It's just a relationship that won't last to long.. unless you have weird taste buds. ... sorry. This is random.. but I sort of just remembered.. I'm being drugged up because of my knee and that's why I was so drowsy.. sorry :P
Sorry.. for wanting a hug? but I mean.. it sounds familiar.. but like.. it's just not something a guy did way back when.. :P And I really liked seeing you too. You handed me like.. scissors.. I could have just stabbed myself with them
Yeah.. now that you mention it.. that sounds pretty awful.. so.. yeah, my bad :P
That's what I thought.. that it was a girls game.. but who knows? You're a much cooler person (:. So.. I'm hoping that your day is going really well (:
Well if amazing means like.. super regular.. than it is :D
haha, thank you for forgiving me.. I don't know what I would do if I hadn't been. Umm.. I hope you had like.. an amazing day! (: And like.. super fun stuff happened Goodnight and sweet dreams an' all :D
I can imagine they are :P
Oh dear, that coiuldn't have been good.. I hope you're not emotionally scarred or anything
I'm sorry to hear about that..  It's.. really nice out.. ish I think.. maybe :P okay.. last time I checked.. it was nice :D sorry :P
That sounds like a fantastic idea! You should do it! :P as for myself, I may just have to go climb a tree or something.. maybe... or I could break something! Or I could do both! :D
Well.. unfortunately I didn't break any bones.. but I did land on my foot sort of oddly.. and it's kinda in pain :D
It's nothing to worry about.. I fell a long time ago.. I can barely even tell now :P Anyways.. I hope your day was good. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and see you tomorrow (:. I hope track was nice.. I know it was nasty-ish outside :P
I know what you mean..  You're really cool (: sorry.... So.. were you serious?
I am pretty serious.. you're the only person I'd like to dance with (well.. attempt to anyways) And.. yeah it's for couples, that's why I asked you (:
sorry... Sorry about that sorry too..  Don't worry.. I'm no good at dancing either..  You're cooler (:
Maybe? I don't think so :P  But.. it might be easy to figure out? Oh.. this is random.. but guess who is the proud owner of an extra ticket to Ben Folds.. :P
I'm rather excited.. sorry It may just be me :P It may also be me who is the owner of that extra ticket :P
Well.. It is rather difficult to believe that you'd be excited about going to prom with me :P And yes, I'm going to le concierto.. with like.. an open seat next to me XD
Well you did a fine job of making it pirate-y.. and I'll try to believe you, but it's hard to because you're so amazing. But.. umm.. sitting next to Drew? For an entire concert? Maybe I should give him both of my tickets.. :P To be honest I really wouldn't know anyone I'd like to see it with.. other than people already going... sorry.. umm.. Goodnight, sweet dreams an' stuff  See you tomorrow (:
It's more like.. he goes crazy at concerts.. and the art show was in the Montgomery Museum in Christiansburg.. it was kinda boring, but not so bad :P I hope stuff for you went really well n' all (:
Don't be sorry that you didn't go.. it's not like there wasn't a poster telling you where it was like.. everywhere.. sorry, just kidding And it was easy to get in that museum because it was dedicated to the artists of the school.. Leyla got 2nd place in it, which I don't know her.. but you being friends with her I thought you might find that cool/exciting
I gotcha... And it is pretty exciting.. I mean, I'd assume it would be :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams. Oh, forgot.. Have fun at that track meet (if you're still going) (:
Oh, thanks? I'm not sure if I remember what it was exactly :P. The street fair was sorta nice.. but nothing missed :P Anyways I hope you have a nice day and that maybe our paths could cross at one point :P
Was it that one thing? Like.. sorry.. But yeah, the food was alright, but it was really crowded :P
oh, sorry about that one thing :P Yeah, I didn't even buy any food.. and somehow I just know it was good :D
If you say so..  I didn't buy any.. but I mooched off of Gap :D It was kinda fun.. how was the meet?
Haha, yeah.. :P Was it really a lot? Like... unfortunately a lot? Because.. then that'd be unfortunate.. :P. Ah.. sorry.. didn't see that :P Well, that's awesome.. I'm sorry I missed it
Yeah, I gotcha.. that sort of stuff always makes things difficult. Well, your day seemed very eventful an' all.. goodnight and sweet dreams. You're awesome n' stuff... sorry :P
Oh, I figured.. it's all good. For some reason I was too, but I stayed up to talk to you :P But yeah, we should, it's pretty outside (:. I'd find it to be really cool :P I'd just have to know when you'd be available :P
I could probably be free after 4 ish o'clock :P
Oh, I'm sorry.. I got stuck at church But no, not too soon.. if I were home I would've been all like "Awesome let's do this!" But.. how about now? Is now too late?
Thank you, I pride myself in my hypothetical situations :P And you're even cooler (:. I'm sorry.. and I hope I didn't get you into any trouble with tha law. umm.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:
Oh.. well.. if you say so.. I kinda feel bad now though
I'm.. okay... How are you doing? (:. Oh, I was a little off on the rain thing.. haha :P But it happened right?
Okay.. a lot off.. but yeah, I suppose only okay. I have art pieces that need to be made by tomorrow..  And.. that's weird.. :P
Oh, it's fine.. I can find something I already made.. it needs to go into that art show at the school, but thanks? :P And I wish I knew.. kinda.. sorry Goodnight, sweet dreams and see ya (:
Nah.. you shouldn't do that :P And maybe I was as school.. o.O Just kidding, I wasn't
Oh yeah, of course.. I'd be deliberately avoiding you an entire day.. that's an extremely likely thing for me to do..
The second thing is more probable than the first.. because the smart thing to do is to spend as much time I can with you [sorry] Nah, I went home sick :P
Well I think you're awesome.. but maybe I'm not the best person to ask And thank you, that.. means a lot even though I don't know what it all means :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams n' all that jazz :P
Well.. maybe you should trust me more?.. sorry :P I'm sorry that I didn't feel amazing in the morning and that I just woke up.. so I hope it's not that much of a disappointment, because it really shouldn't be disappointing at all.. and I miss you too, but I feel like I only have that effect on you :P sorry..
Maybe someday :P I'm sorry it's disappointing.. I'll try to never get sick again. (That's just Drew :P )  I wouldn't know if it were nice or not.. I haven't been outside recently, but I'm sure it is.. and I'm sure that ice cream is fantastic for sore throats :P
Whoa. crazy
Maybe I was just.. a figment though
I don't know. Maybe
On paper. My self portrait was there
It was cute that the boy was voting for me?. That's.. cool. I'm sorry?. Well.. I was actually there. And I would have said hi.. but I didn't want to bother you
The "variety show"?
Oh, right
Yeah.. I was there for the whole thing
Crazy. I even walked by you
I was in the Library. But I left to go get some water
Yeah, that probably happened. Just off by a few seconds
I suppose so. I think I'll be at school tomorrow. That.. frowny face looks super sad
I don't know why it'd be so sad :P. But yeah, I even walked by you.. I would have said hi, but it looked like you were busy
Well.. I'm sorry that I didn't. but I didn't want to bother you
Well I saw you several times. So.. I don't know. But.. my voice sounds pretty terrible. so.. yeah . I mean.. why would you want to talk to a guy who can barely talk back?
Oh.. I can talk perfectly.. there's this other "very awesome" guy in your life?. I'm not going to lie.. that makes me sort of jealous
Oh, yeah.. I was just kidding. My voice get's pretty bad at times. sorry
It's not that bad. It just.. get's bad. at times. My appearance at the festival however, was last minute. So don't feel bad that you didn't see me there
Well.. I don't think so. I'm just me in my opinion
I suppose you have a point there
Haha. We're all intitled to our opinions though :P. Even if they may be a bit.. false :P
Psh, no... My opinions are usually always true
That's your opinion. just kidding, sorry
Only sometimes?. That.. that hurts
It's not negative when you wear a smile at the same time :D
I always do. :D. Negative but happy about it :P
sorry. It doesn't make much sense to me either
haha. Yeah. I need to be right back. I have drugs I need to smoke
And by that.. I mean. I have medication I need to take
sorry
I've gotten pretty pro at it. I don't even need water anymore :P. Except.. I do. Because my throat hurts.. and.. yeah.. almost died yesterday :P
Yeah.. I almost choked on my medication. But yeah.. I like the gummy vitamins. They're pretty fun. But sometimes I fear that I may overdose
yeah, it's terrible. They can't just do that. The temptation is so high for those thigns. things*
Yeah. Those are the kinds that I usually take. But.. that's because I'm boring. Yeah, sorry
Haha.. I should have entered the talent show because of that skill
Or I'd get tackled by an officer... taking pills in school isn't.. technically legal
Maybe. I sure hope so :P. never mind.. anyways.. would it be bad if I didn't go to school tomorrow?
What if it was just to skip out on school and take advantage on the fact that people already knew I was previously sick?
Yeah, I was just kidding ish. :P. Plus, I wouldn't want to spend another day without getting the chance to talk to you
Oh, I'm sorry about that... I didn't even think about the cheesiness of that. Because I honestly.. . never mind. I'll shut up
It's fine, I was about to say the same thing.. but about you
Haha, sure :P. But seriously.. I failed at getting the chance at talking to you today.. so like.. missing another day won't be fun
Nah, it's probably my fault. I kept my head down. So, I'm sorry
I kept my head down because I was.. not feeling so great. you know?. Walking felt really weird :p
Kind of.. being like.. weak in the knees. Sort of when you give me butterflies.. but I don't have the butterflies I just have the weird knee feeling
Oh, well that's cool. sorry. wow.. I just said sorry for something I didn't say :P. I feel.. lame now
I said sorry for thinking it... But I was wondering if you made those Charlie brownies yet :P
Yeah, I was thinking of doing it with all the extra time I had. but then I remembered I was sick.. and then they'd be like.. infected brownies
Haha. Wouldn't want that. I'm pretty sure I just.. saved everyones life by not baking any brownies
Whoa!
Exactly!. Through a technicality I'm the greatest person on Earth. But since it's just a technicality.. and we're in reality.. I'm just a normal guy
that's.. a super nice thing to say
Whoa.. another super nice thing to say. I can't believe it
Haha. sorry. I just.. literally "lol'd". It hurt to laugh.. but thank you
I don't know. the comment was just.. the right amount of random. And the right amount of .. yeah. so.. it made me laugh
Ah. Well.. okay. Well.. you're amazing . Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. sorry... bye :D
See you tomorrow, I hope
bye. haha. Sorry, but like.. I don't know what the "weird" is.. :P Kind of left confused  But.. okay, I hope you had a nice day (:
Hello :D. How's it going?
Oh, I just didn't eat any brownies :P. But.. I'm pretty alright ish kinda. So weird :P Like.. weirder than me.. that's how weird it is..
yeah.. ish kinda :P. sorry. So.. what's up?. Sorry.. if you're like busy.. I can go..
That's awesome. I'm doing nothing.. and I'll continue doing that until the night is through. to do that*
well I'd really like to do something with you, but I feel like I'd just.. be boring. :P. sorry..
If you say so. I'm pretty sure I crushed the hopes and dreams of someone today because I was "boring"
Well it happened. But still.. if you'd really like to waste your time with me.. I'm all for it
Really?. Well.. I'm sorry. It's whatever though
Oh, neat :P
I know . It's.. weird
I know, it scared me
Yeah, too rainy to do *anything
I like the idea. Like.. if you like it. I don't know. sorry
Well.. if you think.. you know. that's not really "knowing". :P. So it's cool if you don't want to. I hope that doesn't change your mind.. sorry
Like a messy room is going to deter me :P
Yup
That's how I've always wanted to.. just kidding. But that sounds cool :D. Plus.. I don't bruise easily.. so it'll be worth it
I'd like it. It'd be better than "He died as he lived"
I like it. I would love that on my tomb stone
Exactly :D
I could always trip over a toy Godzilla at your house?
Alright, well I'll be willing to brave the storm
okay :P
Oh?. This can only mean one thing :P. Or two :P
Either she said yes.. or no :P
Oh... .... Neat :D
Me too. It sounds so.. nice and tranquil.. even though it's pretty violent
So.. are you sure about me being over?
Alright, awesome. Well.. I'll try to be there as soon as I can 
I sure hope. If I don't get struck by lightning. Well, bye . See you really soon (:. hi
I know, I like.. just came in from that
Well like.. I've been trying to contact Drew because he told me to go to squires. And after no one would pick up their phone I walked over there. And then he wasn't there. so I walked back. Yeah :P
I doubt he was. I showed up late.. so I understand that he got tired of waiting. You know.. I'm not worth the wait an' everything :P
Maybe it's good you think that and he doesn't :P
I don't know.. . It means that like.. you like me more?. I don't know, sorry :P
You hear it too?. Oh, and I'm pretty sure you do
Haha. awesome
That's awesome. I like rain, but I like being able to go outside too
You could be happy, I hope you are You've made me happier than I have been by far
Sorry.. that was the first time I've heard of that song. sorry to mislead you. But yeah, it was a nice song, good enough to quote part of it :P
You Could Be Happy by Snow Patrol
Yeah, I liked it. sorry. The song is sorta sad though..
The lyrics are sad. But I think there's a violin too
Haha, yeah. Double sad. but it sounded.. pretty (:
Yeah, me too
I did not
Well, I'll watch it now
It's.. so cute but sad.. it's quite the contradiction
I.. could cry
Now I could cry even more. :'(
Well it's sad to think that you'd be crying
Oh, well.. sorry. I was.. kinda worried. sorry
I'm listening to random music. But that's about it
Yeah :D. You?
Are you reminiscing about your faked suicide?
Oh, well I listen to that song to.. never midn :P. I liked the acoustic version :D. mind*
I have not. Unfortunately. Wait.. I might have. actually
Oh, haha. I don't think I'll ever understand it :P. sorry. just kidding
It's okay. And I got it
Yeah. sorta. Do you need to be somewhere?
Ah, yeah. I gotcha. That's actually.. kinda crazy now that you mention it. I haven't done anything all day
Nah. It's quite boring
I like.. ate and watched movies... and I'd have to agree.. I'm quite boring
Jack.. and I am, you said so yourself
Nah, it's cool. I'm pretty boring
I don't think it works that way. I'm pretty sure I'm so boring I'm just lame
Totally
I don't have anything planned at all. And yeah, totally unnegative :D. You're even more awesome. bye. sorry
I won't, but you should. bye. No, you're still way more awesome
Nothing to do and it's just.. nothin' :P
Fun doing what?
I don't do that well. sorry. Talking to you is always fun, but I'd hate to take away the time you could be using for fun :P
I think the combination together is the best
Picking favorites could hurt the other colors
You could have just hurt their feelings by saying that
So?
Oh. Green, blue, red, orange, indigo, purple, yellow. Well.. maybe blue first :P
See. See what you made me do. I picked favorites and all this emotion is coming up
It's okay. I think the colors can forgive you
Whether I can forgive you or not is another question though
You don't need to change... I like you just the way you are. sorry
Well.. they have to be cliche.. or else it'd be hard to learn
Aw, okay. I'll try.. ish.. probably not... sorry. bye. Have fun :P. I'm.. still sorry...
Oh, okay. you too. Everything
Sorry :P
I don't know.. for talking to you?
sorry about that too. sorry.. kidding ish that time. I really really like talking to you, but I don't understand how you're not bored with me
Possibly..
Well, you're just amazing like that I suppose
It's amazing that you think that I'm not boring. sorry.. but I'm about to. I just made brownies. ish
You could say that. You introduced me to that whole "stumbleupon" thing
So like.. I found a recipe for 3 minute brownies
3 minutes in the microwave
It took maybe 3 to prepare it
It's a great idea
haha, okay. have fun
I wouldn't judge you if you did
Really. I accept you in every way (:. sorry..
(: smiles
You're my world.. and you smile a lot which makes me happy . sorry
Well, thank you for making me happy an' stuff
You don't need to do much. I just.. really like you.. and I really like you smiling. You make me happy (:
(:. That's good. You make me smile a lot too.. but I don't smile all that often unfortunately
Frowning uses more muscles 
And like.. I don't like my smile. !!!?
Oh, well.. my smile must be pretty cool if you like it :P
Oh, haha
I feel like a lucky guy having you in my life. sorry. Oh!. I found nutella.. and put it on my 3 minute brownie. :P
Not going to lie.. it wasn't.. that good... The brownie... the nutella was alright
Me either. the nutella made the brownie better though.. it was pretty cool. sorry, I'm being random
Haha. Now I'm a believer
haha. You've converted me into an entirely different lifestyle . Except.. I'm probably not going to eat it all that much
Haha. I'm glad that you can believe that now. You're.. super amazing. sorry. (:
I'm sorry. :/
Sure?
Awww. That's no fun. I'm sorry about that
I feel like it just won't be the same
Well a world without me could go on.. but without nutella?. I don't think it could last. sorry :P
You feel the same way? haha. I knew it.. . Oh, and that's cool . :D. Sorry, I'm probably interrupting your guitar playing..
Oh, well, take your time
Hmm.. I thought it would have sounded even better
I know. You told me :P
Sorry for not specifying. I feel.. like a pretty lousy person
I feel lousy for different reasons. sorry... I feel like a "loser"
Nah. I just think about "what if I died tonight?". Like.. I know it's morbid
But I don't know if people would care or not :P
Yeah, I just feel like.. I'm a little impact though :P. But like.. I'm not sad or anything.. if like.. you're thinking "OMG he's like.. sad n' stuff"
Just.. recent things have brought that up to mind
Oh, I'm like.. talking to someone. And they're depressed. So I'm trying to help them out. But now I'm just wondering about the same things that got them depressed :P. http://www.humorsharing.com/public/files/posts/images/1005/statistics-021.jpg
I thought you'd like it. Like.. I saw the pic.. and immediately thought of you. sorry. That's.. a little sad
haha, sorry. I really wish I was as amazing as you thought I am
Well.. it's hard to believe that someone as amazing as you would think so highly of me :P
No way, no how
Nah, if anything you're out of my league. Like.. you're major league. and I'm still playing catch with myself
Nah. You're so super amazing. Like.. even without a dog :P. Sorry. But.. I suppose I'm just lucky (:
I'm really lucky because I've got you. sorry
Alright, goodnight if you don't. sweet dreams too
Nope. I had a Gameboy, a Gameboy Color and a Gameboy Advance SP. Kinda skipped the regular one
Yeah
Me too
Yeah. Probably
It was so cool looking. You're so amazing, I don't know why I keep on saying it though
No it doesn't. It's so true. I think the world of you. sorry. But.. I really really really like you
Sorry for what?. It was awesome yesterday. You didn't do anything wrong
Nah, it's fine. I didn't like it all that much anyways. I really like you, and it's cool that you do that (:
Don't be. It's fun. (:
I was going to say and fine. Like.. it's fun just being around you and watch you smile
Oh, I felt kinda weird doing that when it got all quiet
It's cool. It's just.. like.. . You got all quiet. And It was weird hearing my awful voice in the silence
Oh. Okay. I thought you were just like "Oh goodness, be quiet please"
I would have. I don't like my singing voice. :P. But I'm glad you like it
Kind of like.. it's hard not to like you (:
I'm sorry then
What is it?
sorry
I won't. I'm pretty sure you're just amazing.. all the time. And I couldn't judge you in a bad way ever
haha. Oh, I'm still sorry.. about stuffs
You shouldn't be. Like.. I don't even know why you would be
That's how I feel about you. Like.. I'm sorry about yesterday
You shouldn't be sorry either... You're just like.. perfect 
Really now?
Cool :d
:D. Try me
i haven't heard of any of that
Oh, don't they like.. do that with Aerosmith?. Like.. if not. Like.. then still no idea. but I vaguely remember a rap group with Aerosmith
Wow?
So far I'm thinking of a song that goes "It's tricky" and it repeats several times
It finally loaded. If it's what I'm thinking of. That's old school rap. And I highly approve. OH. Yeah!!!!. I've heard of that song. I approve..
It was.. in a lot of movies
Yeah
Haha, that's cool too. I think it was in White Chicks. Maybe. I don't know
Haha. it's cool stuff. I like the old school rap
It's really old
Nah.. it's like.. 20 ish years old
I don't know. :P. sorry
Me either
Haha. yeah. :P
Haha. I'm.. still sorry.. and I'm sorry for saying it again and again
It's fine. (:. It's just.. surprising
it's surprising that you think I am. and that you'd like to be so close to me
Oh, right. that explains everything then
Like.. you're right. Who said? :P. sorry. Just like.. why would you want to be?
The last part is probably the most important
Yeah.. why not chloroform? 
That's what I thought. I didn't catch the "2nd" part so like.. cool. sorry
I didn't catch it then >:O. sorry. But yeah. I love music. as I.. never mind :P. sorry. But yeah.. you're super amazing. sorry
I think accidentally. :P
maybe. I don't know. sorry.. like.. I should probably go.. and you're probably tired of me anyway.. so.. I don't know
Explain what?
Oh.. umm.. well like. I suppose I've just been you know.. I don't know. Isn't everything a guy does with a guy friend a bromance nowadays? 
Right.. well.. I don't know. I can't categorize my self in a bromance as of yet 
I suppose?. I don't know. Right now.. so far.. I've been spending all my time with you.. so as far as bromances go.. I've been pretty out of it
Nah
?
By?
Really now?. That's crazy
haha. I'm sort of surprised
Nah, I'm surprised you didn't know. Well.. actually I'm not. But.. you know. sorry. If you didn't know I'm a Queen fan as well
Yeah, of course. I used to listen to them all the time
That's a good comment. I need to thumbs up it
Oh, that got stuck in my head when you started talking about Queen :P
Yeah, you just reminded me that you are my best friend. sorry
(:. I was hoping you'd catch that
nothing. sorry
haha. It's just like.. an explosion of realization 
haha. I wouldn't want to keep you from that... I'm pretty sure it's more exciting than I could be
Like.. a tart?
sorry.. um.. what do you mean?
oh, okay
They're American..
Nah, I'm just kidding
Yeah. I mean.. I'm from America. Just not as good, ya know?
Sure.. . sorry. I'm just kidding. Mostly because I was born in Germany
haha. You've got a point though
Yeah, American stuff just isn't as good :P
Yeah, but he wanted to be British
Chuck Norris
Haha, yeah. but mostly actors :P
Glee did a cover... I thought you'd know :P
Ah
Yeah, maybe you know better. about everything else
Haha. Maybe you'll know that I'm not so cool :P
Or just enough amazing for you?. And that you do deserve me?
I feel like you deserve me.. like.. I'm not much.. but at least
Like.. at the least you deserve me. Because you deserve more
I think you're perfect (:. Like.. and you deserve.. the best
If I'm the best.. then you deserve me (:. And I think so
Well.. I don't know.. you were asking "What if you are the best?". I was just answering that question
Well.. I think you do.. be it me or not. Because you're amazing and awesome and everything
Totally. I'm sorry :P. but yeah :D
If you say so. It was worth staying up though (:
Well.. just to talk to you. (:
Alright, Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. You're super super amazing (:
Really?. Haha. that's cool. Now that you bring it up.. it is kind of a nice smell :P. sorry. :P. And sorry.. for a lot of other things. Bye (:
slumber is a scary word. sorry :P
I don't know. Like when I think of slumber I think of a creepy voice saying "enjoy thy slumber"
See
I'm sorry
Well.. I'm sorry to make you think of it. That was a terrible thing for me to do. Sorry. But.. yeah.. goodnight n' stuff
Haha, I will. And it's probably because I'm boring you to sleep. sorry, night/moring. morning*
I doubt that. That would scare me awake :P
Haha, that'd be pretty cool. Really cool, I can't remember the last time I played. OH!. I know. :P
I've got like.. my sega genesis upstairs. With an old Mortal Combat and some other games in it. well.. with it
Oh.. sorry to like.. kill your "oldschool-ness"
I used to play it on this really tiny tv. :P
haha, totally
(:. I like you too
Is it a good or bad weird feeling?
Ah.. so that's why it's weird?
Why?
Haha. Yeah, it is kinda silly. But I would really like to continue talking to you
Well, regardless of time. If like.. we left now though.. then you could be like.. fully rested tomorrow and we could talk then too, maybe even meet up? I don't know
I don't think I have one.. and if I did.. it's not as important as you
Well.. you're my friend too. (:
It's really nice talking to you and like.. being with you too. and everything. you're so.. amazing
That's silly talk. But, nice too (:
Goodnight even more amazing person and sweet dreams

Yeah
Why?
Oh, yeah. That's a good point I suppose
Yeah, and everyone are ants
Yeah :D
What?
haha. I've done like.. 2 projects on Ben & Jerry's
It was.. statistics. But like... The foundation of it. What they do. that sort of stuff
Like.. I don't know. It's been a while. But like.. they both met in school. Up in Vermont. And they entered a contest to create a new ice cream flavor
They were like.. buds ever since
Yeah. I also did stuff about pricing and flavors and history. but.. it's been a while
Sounds like fun, I wish I chose it. :P
haha. He should.. :D. But.. you know. I think he's fine where he is
Yeah. I think his time is being used well as just spanish teacher
I haven't heard her do so
haha. will do
Not really.. you?
Sounds like fun
Pretty positive. I mean.. I could plan on something.. so far.. I've got nothing
Well.. if you wanted to do something maybe.. . I don't know, sorry
I mean.. if that's what you think. You know.. I can just stop. I like spending time with you, but if you're bored with me.. I can find something else to do
I see them all the time. They're not deprived :P
Nah, he's hanging out with people right now
Not much to miss. But I hang out with him like.. all the time. so.. you know
I don't know.. I think it could be pretty easy. Anyway.. if you don't want to do something, I can find something else to do 
Okay? so like.. you don't want to?
What could be better than spending time with my girlfriend?
No way is that better. sorry. I'll let this die..
Right. Well.. yeah. There's better stuff you could do with your day too.. so I don't know. Maybe I'll just stay inside
Haha. Well.. I'll do it anyway :D
You could if you wanted
Nah. Sorry. slow responce. But it wouldn't be
Really really (: . You're cooler
I'm not sure what we could do.. or if I'd do anything cool. but you know . It could be fun (:
Sounds like fun. the first part. the second is debatable . Is that a question? because if so.. I wouldn't say I am :P But you're like.. a super duper amazing person who is awesome n' stuff (:. sorry. But if you'd really want to. Like.. it'd be awesome n' stuff
Nah. Plus.. wikipedia isn't that reliable
I'm pretty sure, sorry
Well, I'll try to accept that.. I'm not sure how well I can though. I feel like you could have made that up :P. Sorry
It's okay, it's nice of you to think I'm "awesome". sorry. :P
Well, sure I suppose. It's just.. it's cool that someone like you would think that. sorry
You sure about spending your time with me? I can do something else if you want. sorry
Of course I still want to (:. Is there a time that works best for you, or like.. a place that is also something.. or other?
Okay, I'll see if that's possible real quick
I may.. be stuck here for a little longer than asap. sorry
I'll try and be able to as soon as possible though
The more time I take the less time I'll get with you. so I'll try and be really quick. :P
I'll try not to. I'm sorry. Like.. I'm really sorry
Sure?
Okay, good. Because I may take like.. a lil' longer. but after that I'll be good
Just bear with me :P
A penguin is close?

It's cool. That's still plenty of time
If like.. I could get finished. Alright.. so are you still able to?
Well, that's good enough. (:
Yes. Any time with you.... sorry. I won't even finish that
Yes, I'll be right out there. (:. see you soon
Bye
(:. You're even more awesome 
And it was super fun. It's true (:
Why only then?
Oh, is it really?
I don't think I'm ready for that day. Like.. I could accidentally offend someone
Yeah. I feel like it's the only day I could say "I don't like you" though
Oh.. well I don't like them either
Any day :P
It's fine. I like you so so so so so much too (:
Yeah, I'm sorry. like.. there's even a 'so' in sorry
I think you've mentioned it. You're.. so amazing (:
It makes sense every day. (:. And I didn't think you did
It's good. :P
It is. Just another homework assignment
You should :D
I'm sorry. I mean, you could totally do it. If I've lasted as long as I have.. you'll have no problem
Awesome
ha :P
Aw, really?. Man. shoot. I've been like.. living a lie 
haha. maybe (:
You too. Goodnight and sweet dreams. You're.. super amazing (:. I.. really like you too, sorry.. bye (:
(:. bye :D. Hey, I'm sorry
Ha :P. It's fine. You're so amazing n' stuff. (:
Oh, right.. not everyone else is done either. so yeah. We've got time though. I kind of left a little bit ago and went on a walk. so if you called.. I missed it
Haha, that must have been awkward
Haha, well. That's cool. I'm sorry I wasn't there
Alright :P
Well... I'm doing pretty well.. it's really nice outside. you?
Awesome :D. Still going to that dodgeball thing?
It's Friday?. jk :P
It's the Ben Folds concert that you and I are going to?
Opposite day>. :P
WHOA. :D. That sounds awesome
Well.. cones are nice either way :D
Yeah. That's still awesome :D
Me too (:. I'm.. kinda disappointed about not being able to see you later . Sorry
Well, it'd be cool. But you're probably busy
None that's due any time soon
Whoa :D
I know . It's pretty cool :P
Yay . sorry
haha. fantastic
I don't know how hard that is
Haha. Now that you mention it... I may have a problem with that
haha. I'm proud of you. I.. kinda.. want some ice cream.. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. But ever since you brought up Ben & Jerry's. I haven't been the same
Nah, it's cool. I might just have to go out and get some though. Along with some cookies
That's just a free cone :P. Plus.. Rita's is better :P. I might go there instead
I like.. regular flavors :P. I suppose I care about them equally
Haha. That's.. still okay
I mean.. I still like you
Yeah, of course (:
You sure?. sorry . It's.. probably bad that I want to see you later.. but yeah.. sorry. I can wait until tomorrow :P. sorry
Tomorrow never comes?
A day is a really long time
Exactly. Forever is a long long time since you've lost your ways. Sorry.. quoting Phoenix
Lasso?
Oh.. I was about to mention that one too
Yeah, that one. It's still good :D
I really like you (:
i've never had that.. so I wouldn't know. I doubt that it. is weird though. :D
Yeah, totally. Even people like me.. who had no idea that it existed. Maybe you should totally go get some?
That's.. a good point. Well.. I'd go get soem for you . some*. I'm not sure.. if I could like.. get it to you without it melting though
I would do it though
Nah, that was my idea. He invited me over.. but I asked you first. So I compromised. sorry.. it was probably lame of me to do that
If you say so. I could do it again..
... that's just.. even sillier
How/. ?*
I already walked further than that today. It really wouldn't be a problem :D
I walked like.. to the hand and hand. and the dark isn't bad :P
We have. But like.. tigers and jabberwockies are cool with me. We're best buds :D
haha. You got me there.. 
Alright, cool. Have fun (:
haha. :v
haha. That's.. a funny.. but morbid thought of him. Well.. alright. Talk to you later?. sorry... You're.. really really amazing (:. bye
haha. :P. You're so cool (:. sorry..
Haha, alright, goodnight then. Have a nice evening (:
Bye, you're so awesome

haha. cool. Sorry.. but.. goodnight and sweet dreams n' stuff (:
Nope. :P. Does this mean you did?
Yeah, I know what you mean... Drunk people scare me
Nah, it was fine. I popped my knee on the way home (:
Like.. when I said my knee kinda felt weird?. Well.. I like.. fell on it. And it feels better (:
Haha, I'll try to be. But it was awesome, I really enjoyed it. And I really liked being with you n' stuff
Haha. Definitely. Just have a light show in your bedroom
Haha. I bet. If Ben Folds ends up at your house.. I may need to know :P
Do you really?. Because I find that hard to believe :P
Gotcha. :P. I wouldn't mind 
I'll vouch for you
Haha, if you say so
Haha. Good point
Yeah
Sorta like me >:O
Nah, not really
I don't know.. I'm not sure I could say the same. I'm pretty sure I was pretty lame
Fine.. . Well... You're amazing (:. sorry..
Right when I was going to say.. . never mind. Alright. Goodnight then
I'm not kidding.. but you have a point. Homework comes first
Oh.. when I left?
Like.. over into the darkness?
Oh.. I said "I'm going to go get lost over here.. maybe even die"
Yeah
Nah.. I really said "I kinda wanted a hug, but I'm just going to walk backwards". Just kidding.. the first statement was the real thing 
Nah... Well... maybe. a little
Nah.. I think you need to keep it in there to keep it believeable :D. And you're cooler (:
Because.. you're so cool you don't need shades (:
And.. maybe you're cool because like.. I really like you.. . wait... never mind. that doesn't work
I'm not sure if being my girlfriend makes you cooler . sorry..
You sure?. Because I'm not sure it does. and..... sorry. I'm keeping you up
Oh.. okay. And neat (:. sorry
Haha, yeah. It's cool if it attacks you tonight... I'll totally.. not understand. jk. sorry. I should let you go, I'm probably boring you to death
You're so so so amazing, good night and sweet dreams (:
haha.. golden :P. sorry. G'night Leandra, stay awesome. I wish it were raining still. sorry. bye
Exactly. (:. It's so nice
haha (:
Kinda?
Haha, I knew before :P
I'm sorry. Like.. I didn't hear you at first.. but then like.. I did
It's not. I'm sorry. I'm an awful person
Yeah.. I'm sorry. I'm honest about everything else
Alright. I hope that like.. you don't think everything I've told you is a lie
I'm sorry?
I was questioning if like.. I had anything to do with it
Ah, well.. okay then. sorry. you first :P
Really?
What am I supposed to say?
Umm.. just that you're super amazing and a bunch of other stuff. what were you going to say?
Well.. I suppose I understand?. sorry
Well.. maybe I should go before you say something you don't want to?
Sorry.. right.. well.. love makes you feel weird things :P. Goodnight (;. (: *. sorry
I'm right? that's a first.. see you then :D
You were fantastic at the meet! I hope your day went well, goodnight and sweet dreams (:
Hello (:
oh.. okay . My 200m was alright I suppose.. but that relay was pretty sad to be honest :P But.. wait.. did you like.. walk by?. I'm sorry if like.. you're busy
If you say so
That's very unfortunate
I got first in my heat.. but that's not the point :P Well maybe it's best you didn't.. I probably would have ruined your night
That's a good idea
Nah. I think you could pull it off :D. I suppose maybe? But like.. I don't know.. I'm lame n' stuff.. I could probably ruin it easily :/
Nah, I don't think that's possible. But okay. Have fun. I hope you had a nice day (:. Stay amazing n' stuff, g'night n' all. sorry
I dream a little bit about the chance of seeing you . sorry, bye. I don't know.. seeing me is just a waste of your time.. :P
My bad... sorry
I wrote an unfamiliar song.. but I shouldn't keep you
But like.. I don't want to waste your time more than I have to
Well.. my heart know's exactly what it wants, but my head gets in the way and makes everything change. It says we will never be, but I know it's just me. I don't know what to say, but I love you in everyway. And I don't know what to do when my heart loves only you.
Really?
Well I'm starting to think my head's wrong and I should have followed my heart all along
Well.. kinda/sorta.. I don't know..
Well like... I don't know. My head just doesn't think I deserve you. n' stuff
Yeah, I suppose :P I don't know.. I'm sorry. Like.. I don't know. i'm sorry
Which one?. Sometimes I just don't know what to think
Ah. That's what I thought, sorry
Talk You Down by the Script is the opposite :P. Kinda
Yeah. I'm gonna use my heart and not of my head
Possibly
I'm sorry for keeping you. I'm sorry that like.. sorry 
I'm sorry for being yours?. I don't know. sorry
Well like.. you deserve better.. and you wouldn't have those weird feelings and stuff. But seriously.. I should just stop talking. and let you go
I don't know.. the ones that you said you had?. I honestly don't know much about it
But like.. if I weren't in the picture.. you'd be fine. sorry.. I'm just listening to my head :P
Nothing more?
oh.. sorry
I don't know how I deserve you.. you're so amazing.. and all I do is waste your time when you've repeatedly said you had to go
Alright, later. just three words that seem to be a curse. See you tomorrow hopefully
Will I not see you tomorrow?
Oh, my bad. Nah.. not those. Really close to "I like you" and.. I probably shouldn't send this..                                                Yup.. buh bye. :P
Not really.. I don't know
sorry. :/
sorry, I'm dumb :P. Anyways. Have a fantastic night
You're an amazing.. girlfriend (:. sorry
That was funny :P. And thanks... I really pride myself in that. Bye :D
Being a good girlfriend >:O. sorry
.... thank you. may be crushing my spirits.. but thank you
... Not a man like Jackson. come on... way to misquote me entirely
fine... sure..
yeah. sorry.. still
.. okay? maybe :P. Sweet dreams (:
Teehee?
Yup. How'd you know?
Yeah.. I know :P
Really?. Well.. funny thing... I've gotta go replace mine right now :P
So I'll be right back
back
Very much so. :D
haha. I know what you mean. :D. I heard the track meet is cancelled 
Yeah, that's always nice
Not really.. I was in and I was out. It was really quick. But I've got like.. strong teeth. so the dentist had a rough time. Oh.. be right back again.. I'm going to go get a lighter
Yeah, haha. you know.. a lighter.. I don't have a hot plate. I might need to do this outside... But yeah.. so I can actually read whatever you wrote
haha. Yeah.. the note I gave you was like.. blank-ish
Yeah, sorry. I got the lighter just to make sure I wasn't dumb and wrote something completely unrelated
Right, gotcha. well.. If it wasn't as pink as it was.. I probably would have dismissed it as a regular scrap of paper
Whoa.. I'm starting to gain a little bit of feeling in my face. random, sorry. but yeah.. I <3 u 2 . sorry..
But your fingers can o.O
haha, yeah. :P
What was going on?
cool. I.. wanted to ask if you were available later today.. however due to recent events.. I'm not sure if it'd be alright
I have not.. . but mostly because I'm still bleeding. and soft foods are hard to come by
that.. sounds amazing. Okay.. gotta go get more gauze . be right back
Well thank you for filling me in on that. I may just have to do it too :D
haha. I'll leave those uncrushed. :P
(:. I like you too
you think?
That.. made sense.. and I completely understood it.. yet I'm still confused. sorry
ah. I haven't a clue of what that is
I assume this is another one of those commercials I've never seen 
That's really cool
Yeah.. so like.. I really really like you and yeah. sorry..
Well, I don't think so. I think the word you meant to say was average
I mean.. it's only me you know. so I'd say it was
Haha, alright
Just to show you.. I'm going to also eat a doughnut
Yeah. Well.. have fun with that doughnut. I heard that I could like.. eat ice cream.. which is a crazy thought
Both :P. So yeah.. if I had ice cream.. that'd be really cool :P
Haha, yeah . :D. I think.. the blood has stopped :P
I didn't get it. And yeah, like to celebrate with me?. jk :P
Oh.. the Charlie Chaplin thing?
Ah, that's nice :D
Whoa.. that could be it
haha. Well.. I feel bad for keeping you away from that doughnut
Haha, alright... Maybe.. we could hang out later?. I don't know... never mind. bye
Alright, neat. bye (:. for now :P
Happy eating of doughnut. HED for short :P
Well.. that's usually never included, but good point. :D
Good point. also. And in this case it totally makes it awesome-er
Haha
Alright, cool. (:
Haha. I like it
Oh yeah.. the one who plans to kill everyone
Just wait until Psychology
Rorschach?
Yeah, that may be one of the only reasons I remember the name
Right, yeah.. I bet a lot of people are
I think so
Oh.. I like that one better
Alright, hopefully I'll see you later maybe
Bye. hiya
haha, thank you. Well, there's always tomorrow.. maybe.. probably not
Nah, I was just suggesting that we could do something cool. But like.. you're probably busy
Ah. Well, cool then :D
Neat (:. I had an uneven amount of gauze :'(. Now only one hole isn't oozing
sorry. It is. Mostly because I can taste the blood. sorry. that is.. really gross. I'll shut up now
Yeah.. unfortunately I don't box... or sparkle
Yeah. Too bad I can't though... It's just.. I'm exactly what girls don't look for... you know.. human
sorry.. it was just a joke. I mean, I would hope that human is at the top of the list of "Guys I would date". You know?. Plus I know the jokes not true.. because I've got you. well.. I think anyway
It's good you think :P. sorry. umm.. yeah, I think. :P
Because it could happen o.O
Exactly, . it's scary :P. But the wind is calm where I am. so I wouldn't know what you're talking about :P
Maybe you have your own personal tornado
I wouldn't be surprised... considering there's a tornado outside your house
Not wind chimes!
Well, I think you'll be completely safe
It's kinda crazy.. I heard sirens too. But those words of encouragement were partly to make me think you'd be safe.. because if anything were to happen to you.. I don't know what I'd do
Maybe.. more than friends with you?
yes?
That... never mind... sorry
boyfriend & girlfriend? . sorry. Never mind
I'm sorry
Well, that's good. I think
sorry. I just.. want to say.. I'm yours and only yours.. if that's like.. not lame at all
Really?. I find it to be a fantastic decision
Because I really like you.. and every day I see you I fall a little more for you. You're just too good to be true. And you're so amazing, and funny. And I love spending time with you. I'm pretty sure there's no place I'd rather be. .. sorry
No. Why?
No, not at all. If anything you deserve better. Because you're the best out there
Just adequate?. You're a lot better than I am. I'm just some guy that happened to pass by
Maybe you just like me.. and that's what makes me special
I find it pretty special that a girl as amazing as you would like me. But I'm just ordinary and nothing special here
I was just about to say
I say you would
I'm fine with silly. But being silly isn't being special. I'm sorry, but I think you're perfect
This is completely not in the context that you want it in.. but I also think you and I go together
I don't know.. I assumed you were referring me as perfect . but you were saying you and perfect don't go well together, you might come close though. see?
Kev?
oooooh. sorry
Well I see it now... So I feel stupid
Yeah, maybe. I still don't see why you don't understand how I like you.. to be honest.. I feel bad when you say that.. sorry
I really wouldn't know what to say that could convince you that I like you
I'll try and find a way. Because I really like you, and I want you to know that
Haha.. that means it's completely possible :P
Well, I'll try. I don't trust my ability though
Awww. man
It's fine.. maybe I should just be heartbroken.. it's a lot easier
?
And?
It's cool. And yeah.. but it'd still be easier
You say I deserve better.. but do you really think you could stand seeing me with someone else? because I can't see myself with anyone but you and if I weren't with you I'd be heartbroken
You're already the bestest for me. you don't have to change
Well I wouldn't know of them
Aw?
You're the only girl for me because you're the one I need I wish I could say everything I could think because then you'd know how much you mean. sorry.. that was really bad. but.. it sorta gives a clear statement. ish. sorry
I don't know how to put it to words. The wind picked up over here. which is weird
maybe. But, I don't know. You mean a lot to me
What?
Trust me, there's no one better. You're the only girl in my eyes . You're perfect and I'm really lucky that you like me. I really don't think I could like anyone else like I like you. You know the reason I say sorry all the time is because I feel like I'm not good enough.. like I'm a disappointment
If you say so.. but I just feel like I'm an ordinary guy. And I don't deserve to be in the same light as you. But you know what?. I don't care any more... I'm proud that I'm yours and I'm not listening to my head any more
I don't care. You're worth it
It's so sad that you don't see yourself the way I do. Like.. you really should. Except.. you shouldn't. because you're even better than how I see you
well okay. I'm free whenever
but I don't know.. am I just a guy that you like but it's impossible for me to like you back so that because of that we.. never mind.. I'm not finished that thought                              Please.. ignore the white space. But yeah, free whenever. so if you want to talk. you know :P
It's just.. I don't know what I'm saying
I don't know. You deserve me at the least.. . bare minimum 
Please don't love somebody else. sorry... But yeah, negative.. but that happens. I was negative for the past few days
Possibly. Like.. I'm pretty bad at it. I just get this feeling where I feel like I'm not good enough and that I should just leave you alone
Well I feel the same about you. So like.. I feel like.. we're thinking too much
Crazy, Stupid Love
I don't understand it much either
I don't think it should be. It's something unexplainable and you can't understand it.. but when it happens there's something about it that just makes you think "Hey, I must be in love". But at the same time you still don't understand it.. and it confuses you
But like.. in the end.. you just.. sort of know
It may be a completely wrong definition. but it's sort of just how I feel
Well thank you
I don't know where those words came from though. I'm pretty sure I couldn't like.. just come up with that definition
I think so. I think with my heart and you're always in my heart.. so I always think of you
Well I mean it
Well that's good. Has something got you down?
I assume that's something, but I won't pry. I.. just found the song "Enchanted" by Owl City. and I think I like it. sorry, random
Oh.. Taylor Swift made a version first. Then Adam Young made his own
She wrote the song about Adam, then he made his own version about her
Yeah. Well Adam Young made his and it's really happy n' stuff
I suppose?. Do you doubt?
I didn't hear about it. I sort of wish I could write a cute song for you
Nah
A lot of what I write is about you
Why is that a bad thing?
How?. Because all my lyrics are bad?
Well I'm sorry
Some depressed girl named Debbie. :P. I don't know. But.. I'm sorry. You really shouldn't be down on yourself though. You're awesome. I feel like it's my fault. One of these days.. I will write a song that actually works together and isn't so blatantly obvious
I mean.. I get depressed at times.. so like.. I know how it's like to be a "Debbie Downer". Or.. Danny Downer. just to make it masculine 
I do... :{
:P *
Mustache is like.. must ache. so.. people who have mustaches must hurt all the time
I haven't a clue
Yes.. I do. just kidding
go ahead. :D
There's the wind again. Wind and again.. are technically an approximate rhyme
And I hear it too
The wind >:O
Haha. I'm so glad I know your reference... If I didn't I could just go.. . I don't know. something bad
And die?. Sure
And get hurt?. Great ide
idea*
Nah. I feel like I could break something
Wow.. my bee sting itches :P. sorry.. random
Remember how you freaked over that one bee?. Well.. bees sense fear. so.. yeah.. I recently got stung
Like I said.. remember how you were scared?
It's whatever.. it didn't hurt
what?
Am I supposed to?. Because I will..
I'm not sure if I should lie though
Yeah.. kinda. I was walking away and it got swollen
Nah, it stung the right person :D
Just.. rub some gasoline on it >:O
Nah..
If you got stung that would be sad n' stuff. Oh, really?. I have..
I got stung by a ground bee. And I fell down a hill because of it
I've been stung several times
those are pretty violent ones. and it's hard to see their nest. making it easy to get stung
It's easy. A bee get's angry and it stings someone
My brother got stung in the mouth once. Wasps are the worst though. I hate them so much :P
Yeah. it was a while ago. Bee stings are whatever now. I get one and it's just like ouch
Just gotta walk it off. It's nothing, don't be sorry
In fact.. thank you :D
swelling went down.. but no. Thank you for being with me. Because everything prior to the sting still makes everything better
Nah, it's cool. seriously. Don't blame yourself. I just stood there. Mostly because I know they won't mess with you if you don't move/care
I had a wasp that stung me once... And it just hung onto my back for a minute
And like.. the spot on my back was bigger than a quarter
yeah. actually
Yeah, a long time ago though
haha. Yeah.. that bee just didn't want to let go. I don't think I've ever met anything else that was like that
With spiders too?. Oh and I meant no other clingy anything
You choose to let go :p. sorry, just kidding
Why would you melt?. I mean.. that's silly
I mean.. you can't just sublimate like that
darn.. did I get the word wrong?
I don't know if that's good or bad. but I'll stop the world and melt with you. (sorry). But I really know what you mean. I can really feel the sublimation, you know?
I can't tell just what you know, but you've known it the whole time
Yeah, or something, that really can't be it. :P
I was honestly quoting a song. except.. I quoted it wrong
I can tell just what you want. You don't want to be alone you don't want to be alone. But I can't say it's what you know, but you've known it the whole time, yeah you've known it the whole time. But yeah, I didn't think that's what you knew in the first place :P
It's by Two Door Cinema Club. What You Know
I know :D. I kinda wish I knew what you know. :P
That's why I can't say it's what you know. But again.. you've known it the whole time
I don't know. Let me listen to the whole song. In a few weeks I will get time to realize it's right before my eyes and I can take it if it's what I want to do and I am leaving this is starting to feel like it's right before my eyes and I can taste it it's my sweet beginning. Nope.. I don't think it actually says anything to help out
Maybe. :D
I know. What makes you bring it up though?
Nope
From what I gather.. it's about a girl who is.. just kinda there
I don't know. Maybe?
Yeah, I don't know what I'm saying. But you're right.. love is silly. But maybe not necessarily a bad thing. sorry.. it's morning. so like.. I'm going to assume you fell asleep.. so I'm going to go and wish a farewell. Goodnight and sweet dreams
Oh, sorry.. I wasn't near by.. and I hope yours is going nicely too
I doubt that could be it :P It's probably my fault for just staying online :P
I don't think I'm doing anything special.. That could always be a possibility though :P I was kinda hoping to hang out with you today, but seeing how it's the 16th and a Saturday.. you probably have Important Things
Hi. Well, cool then.. me neither :P
How are you?
I'm alright also.. I suppose. :P
I suppose so
It's been going normally. I ate a sandwich and some cereal earlier. and a bunch of m&m's. Just the normal kinds of food
I use my teeth.. and I chew. You know.. like usual
Yup
sorry
I'm amazing?. I'm pretty sure that's how
haha, totally
Behind my canines
Just 2
I don't know.. I miss it. :P
Nope
Yeah, I know what you mean
Haha, I have some googly eyes. I can at least try
I think they threw mine away
Well.. I'm just garbage anyway
Which Train song?
Ah. That makes sense
Yeah. Well, thank you for enlightening me
It was. Thank you. So.. there's probably not a chance of me being able to see you tonight, is there?. sorry, stupid question 
It's not that late. but you know.. you probably wouldn't want to anyway
Oh well.. it's still kinda late. kinda though. so who knows. I mean, there's some light out n' stuff
Well, if you wanted to.. . we could?. maybe..
Not really.. I just thought we could talk and walk and do whatever comes to mind
Well, it could be. For however long it is
Yeah, it's always a good thing. I think. maybe
I don't know :P. I suppose it makes things a lil' easier
Whoa is it a full moon tonight?!?. sorry. go on?
It's pretty silly. and I don't know.. it looks really pretty though
What does an Ace look like anyways?
I have seen it
The movies more important than me though.. so like.. maybe we could do something some other time. It's alright. I suppose
I don't think that's what I meant
Like.. your time would be better spent watching it. I know.. I kinda like walking.. however I suppose it's dark and would be boring. Boring for you of course
I don't know.. I would have thought you wouldn't have wanted to do anything. So I didn't plan that far ahead
And I bet she'd use that power
Like.. instantly
Well, good luck
Umm.. hmm.. a good place that would get a possible good outcome.. hmm... We could always stay near by. Like.. your house
Still iffy though :P
So.. I take that as a no?. sorry
Well I can't wait for tomorrow then (:
I heart you too
Yeah. Have you heard that song "DJ's Got Us Fallin' In Love Again"?
Well.. I just spent all day making a beat for it on Garage band
Yeah.. unfortunately I feel like I did it wrong
Yes. However.. not at this moment
I mean.. never mind. It was on. I just.. didn't know :P
That's unfortunate. I don't even know what the problem is. so.. I'm not sure how I could help
Ah. Well.. like.. is there like an alternative to anything?
Good Luck
Oh yeah, looks pretty amazing :D. I find it crazy how you can somehow send me a chat message even though I log out prior to it :P
It's weird.. because like.. I wake up and I see that I've missed 3 chat things..
Yes, they were.. it's weird though because I went offline :P but I'm sorry about your computer and I hope your wish comes true :P
Nah. No chance at all. Maybe :P I believe in the WishBear too :D. kidding, of course
That must be it... The music video to For The First Time is pretty neat. :P
Maybe it's been a while
Or that :P. So.... You didn't want to do anything today, did you?
Well if it's not. It's cool :P
Yes :P
Awesome :D
Oh, well.. I don't think you've shown me it. But thank you. It seems nice (:
Have I made you crazy? :P. And yeah, they're nice lyrics :D
I want to spend my time with you. sorry.. umm. I don't know. What do you wanna do?
That sounds really cool
pshh.. not that cool :P
That's cool. That just means we should meet up as soon as possible :P
Awesome (:. So.. whenever is best for you
That's best for you?
Oh, alright. Where's the dentist place?. Oh.. never mind. Sorry. Thinking of two places. Alright. Sounds good :P. :D
Yeah, sorry. I was.. off on a tangent . But I should have been on a cosine all along :P. Alright, well.. I'll see you then. :D
Thanks :P. I bet Boling would like it :P
Haha. Neat :P. Well.. see ya soon
Alright, cool 
I happen to be here :D. Good night and sweet dreams. (:. You're amazing. Sorry.. see you tomorrow (:
Especially the imitation crab . There are three words  Trapped on my tongue I would like to say them But I feel like I'm the only one. sorry, but you're like.. so amazing. Words cannot describe
It did. I wrote more..
I think :P
I was thinking of stuff.. and only wrote down those 4 lines of what I thought
Yeah. The wandering question kept me up; 2am who do you love?. Well.. it's 11pm.. but the song said differently :P
Yeah. I'll spend forever, wondering if you knew. sorry. I'll stop quoting that :P
I wish I knew how to say it like they do
Why, thank you. I don't want to write just another love song, I want to write yours. Sorry.. I was trying to be creative there.. and I failed
Nah, I totally came up with it. Unless it is in another song. Then I'm just.. uncreative
I just noticed that the song "When We First Kissed" like.. doesn't even say anything about it. Like.. not really
Well like.. it does. But like... Hmm. It just has him asking "If you would". And it doesn't say the words "When We First Kissed" in it. sorry.. random stuff
Maybe. Who knows
Sounds like fun :D. I gotta do some chemistry stuff. so.. I think I might go do that. Anyways. Good night :D
I've never had it before. But I assume it's bad because you put it into relation with me
Well.. you may have a point there
Which made my wish come true (:
Mine was for your wish to come true :P. Mostly because your wish benefitted me as well. But.. that sounds sort of selfish of me
Yeah, sure :D. I really liked seeing you today (:
Nah. Don't be. I was completely fine with it (:
Yeah, of course. Why would I dislike you hugging me?
Why in 5 minutes?
I don't think I could regret spending time with you or hugging you
I'm excited too (:. You're amazing
Well you're up there with me (:
Nah, I'm pretty sure you're always amazing (:
(:. See you tomorrow. saying "girlfriend" at the end of that would sound like a cliche moment when this really valley girl is talking to a friend
Well, either way.. you're an amazing girlfriend (:. Good night and sweet dreams :D
(:. Bye :D
Alright home slice
I made it kinda rhyme there :P
Yeah. :P. I heard no one likes a rhymer.. so I may have to stop
Yeah.. . But I may just have to give up on songs n' stuff
Sure she is
I'm.. . yeah.... how are you?
umm.. sure?
Maybe it is :P
umm.. possibly. are you?
Just.. inadequacy . It's really whatever
Just.. everything. I don't feel good enough. For anyone. Sorry. I don't want to bring you down with my problems
nah.... I couldn't be
Possibly. And I may have like.. killed myself if you hadn't stopped me.. jk
That's the worst jk ever in the history of anything, sorry. I don't know.. . Like.. never mind. sorry
Nah.. I wasn't going to finish the thought in the first place
Sorry. It's kind of hard not to though
Sorry.. I don't know.. I'm just sort of bummed today
I just need a hug I think. jk. I already got one. :P
That I got a hug? Yeah.. totally. Hugs just trouble me so much
Well.. thank you for thinking that
I don't know.. I say a lot of things that I find are true yet you still have trouble believing it. Plus.. I've got your WishBear thing. So like... what can you wish on?
Well I'll put it to good use
Well.. I may agree on pretty.. but perfect?. haha, just kidding. I don't agree on either :P
(:. Way to make me have a better mood. :P
Well.. it's just.. really cool hearing it from you
I'm pretty sure it counts. You're amazing and everything
(:. I think you'd be special regardless. But I can count it
Because I'm yours?. (:
:/. Oh.. and I did when you named their songs. Like.. the name was unfamiliar. but the songs reminded me
Well.. like.. you're super special. And I'm really lucky to be yours. n' stuff
Well I will.. you're the best thing to ever happen to me. sorry.. that was really.. cheesy
Because you're so unbelievably amazing. Like.. I could be dreaming or something
I really really like you too (:. And if it were a nightmare than it's a really really amazing one
Yeah. Because you're there
Aw, alright. You're so amazing. Have a good night and sleep sweet dreams. :D
Nah.. I'm not. It's the other way around. Bye (:
It's cool . Just reminded me sooner. :D. See you (:. And if so.. then I don't care about "leagues"
Because of you . sorry, bye
Well.. I'm pretty sure you help
Night, if that didn't send
Me too. :D. Sorry.. I just got back
Epic. I got a Misto. from Ritas
Yeah. I've never had it before. I got swedish fish with chocolate custard
Yeah :D. haha. It's so weird of a flavor. :P
haha. Awesome
It's alright. I'm still drinking it. I.. kinda wanted to write that poetry with you :P. sorry
Oh.. good point. Well if only
haha. That's crazy
Yeah, it's pretty cool. :D
What?. Okay?
What is it?. Or.. do you not want me to know :P
Haha, that's awesome. :D
haha, that's.. pretty sweet
It equals rainbows, right?
Oh yeah. That's even better. I'm going to be alone at that meet :P. Oh well :P. Don't you have some poems to write?
Yeah, alone.. Gap, Drew, and you won't be there. But yeah.. I feel like I shouldn't waste your time.. seeing how you've got some important things to do
Umm.. I put bread on bread. and crackers. Maybe some like.. a bicycle 
Yeah :D. matchsticks and lighters
Where's the fun in that?. Is this to help your poem?
Oh.. . I thought you said out of the ordinary things.. so I don't know. Thought you became Dr. Seuss 
Oh, that sounds extremely normal :P
I put like.. honey smacks, honey, gram crackers, and granola bars on a sandwich once. Oh.. and peanut butter. If that's normal :P
It even goes well with me :D
.... o.O
glue.. glue could work
Good point. Well.. I don't think I'd want to get eaten. so... ya know :P
Most people eat things based off of like.. the visual appeal, right?. So.. that could explain cannibalism . sorry... random
sorry... I'm just going to go now
sorry,,
I feel stupid for saying that
What?
haha. That's neat
Haha, alright
Aw... alright. sorry. Bye. Have fun n' stuff
Nah.. sorry :/. :P. Bye. Have some nice poem writing skills n' stuff
Is my what?. Which line?
Did I say that?. *sigh**. Because if I did.. go ahead and take it
I don't know.. you said "Is your line open"
OH. sorry. I'm slow
Yeah.. sure
I thought that like.. never mind. I'm dumb :P. But yeah.. if you find the need to call, go ahead
It's cool
Good luck
Nah. Well.. maybe
Plenty of people. But I suppose I'm pretty lucky.. because I've got the girl of my dreams (sorry for cliche-ness). And on that note.. I may have to leave too.. on sheer stupidity 
sorry.. but umm.. goodnight n' sweet dreams and stuff (:. I hope that whole dentist thing went well today and I hope you had an overall good day (:
I know what you mean.. that stuff has happened to me too :P And if you don't mind me asking.. but why would my pillows be gone?. Hey :D. How's it going?
Hear what correctly?
Oh.. that would be correct. But like.. "great" probably shouldn't be there
I don't find it so crazy :P
OH. This is completely random. But I saw a guy playing the banjo when I walked home. He was like.. downtown. It was so cool :D. I gave him 2 dollars and walked away
College
haha. I respect the banjo. So I walked back to him and you know.. was impulsive. Oh.. I wrote a song on my walk home too :P. Random.. I know. But I somehow remembered it :P
I just finished writing it down :P. But it's long.. and bad. so I wouldn't want to bore you. Yeah.. it's crazy stuff.. and I suppose you're right.. I should always be prepared.
Nah, that rap was awesome. :D. But do you really want to read it?. It's pretty bad. :p
Nah.. I'm pretty sure I'm a complete waste of your time. But.. if you insist. Here it is:. All I know Is I walk alone But I am fine I have for quite some time It's okay The skys not grey At least not today Not anyway  I think I Could Waste your time But it'd be no use of mine But it's okay I'll do it anyway But not today  Because You say I have lost my mind I say That I've found it this time  You say I'm insane That I've lost my brain But I say That I've stayed the same  You think That I Would give up so soon But I  Would never give up you  And all the things I think to say And all my fears seem to fade away But not today Not anyway
I think you're my muse :P. sorry 
Not much of a talent, but thank you
Nothing. You?
Well.. apparently I just got a phone call. I have to go to a childrens chior at my church until 7:30. However.. I didn't have anything else in mind and I kinda wanted to hang out with you. (You could go to the chior thing?). jk. It's like.. far away.. and it'd be maybe boring for you
Well.. actually. by childrens chior I mean *childrens* chior
Orphans are coming to my church to sing
I don't know the exact details
I really kinda wanted to hang out with you though
Oh.. another thing came up. I cant go to the chior thing. So like.. we could do it whenever now :P
Nah. I now have a job that gets in the way of the choir thing. So when I get done with that... you know
I'm free for the rest of the night
Nope. You're the only one. I will have to run to the middle school (the old one) real fast though. So like.. if I catch you online later.. then yeah. :P. Or.. I could call you?. sorry.. but I gotta run :P
Alright. Okay, talk to you later (:. Yeah, sorry.. running was a lot of work :P
Aw. alright... :/. Oh well. My job was to run over to the middle school grab stuff my dad forgot and then run back. And it was the only way I could spend time with you tonight... But.. oh well. :P. Well.. I'm off to get my instructions for the weekend.. I really wish I could see you, but oh well.. I suppose some other time.
I always seem to miss you. I can't explain how or why
Oh, yeah. Sorry. But like.. whenever I check facebook you're like.. there but not there
But like.. I miss you too
Nah. It's your amazing awesomeness that makes me miss you. (:
I mean like.. when you're away... And like.. when I'm not around. I think about you all day. And.. I could continue the meter.. but you know. That would make it cliche
Down, town, clown, bound. sound. Found. a lot of stuff rhymes with it
Yeah. :P
I'm not gonna lie.. I'm feeling crushed about not seeing you tonight. But.. I'll get over it. :P. I mean like.. you're not missing much though.. so maybe it's best :P
Nah.. you're amazing (:. You would have made my night awesome!. But like.. you still are now (:. Just like.. I can't see you :P
The reason? Do I really need one?. You're funny, fun to be around and it's really awesome to talk to you
I really wish you would. But I can keep reminding you if you don't. I think I heard somewhere that's what a boyfriends supposed to do..
Looks like an inordinate amount of fun
Alright, have fun then?
Ah.. yogurt and berries help :P. Yeah :P
Oh.. I thought you meant to send that :P
Amazing!
haha, sounds even better. Well.. I hope you have fun with that.. along with that bowling thing
But it says you and your closest friends
Ah. well... Sorry then?
And..  I'm just another guy Who's in your life There's no way I could take your time  Because you're talking about A smoothie with yogurt And I'll just bring you down And get you hurt. Well.. not really that last part.. but it's all I could think of to make it rhyme. But that's a good point.. sleep is awesome
This may be a very dumb question.. but why?
Hmm.. well it is the weekend. So.. I could always ask
Oh well.. the max I could probably stay out would be around 12 ish
Yeah.. but you know... Why waste your time?
You sure?
.. that's cool (:
You're cool :D
I like you too (:
Of course (:. I would love to be your boyfriend
Sorry?. For what?
It's fine. You weren't weird. You're amazing (:
Well, I think you're pretty amazing.. and being your boyfriend is amazing too. sorry
Well.. I think improv would be cool. And.. you can expect your doorbell to ring at some point :P. maybe
Yeah. I asked my dad, he didn't care
Even with that. Like.. it doesn't matter how long or how late
Haha.. totally. Well... maybe. He's really just lenient
haha. If you say so. You don't really have to live with him though :P. But yeah.. If you want.. I'll stop bye and say hi n' stuff. *cough** kiss you goodnight. What?. Who said that?. :P. jk of course :P
Sorry . But I'd have to agree.. I'm pretty creepy :P
haha.. I'd hope so
haha. Alright... I just need to know one thing... Would you seriously want me there?. Someone's knocking at my door.. and it's scaring me
.... I'd love to see you in the process :D. Alright.. I'll see what i can do. If your doorbell rings at some point... Then it might be me. if it's not.. duck for cover. (:. Alright, maybe seeing you later. But.. I gotta go and.. get there first :P
Oh.. the scariest. bye (:
Hi. Well.. what your hand wrote was pretty amazing.. but I bet your heart was all like "I didn't tell you to write that.." But I suppose it'll always be a mystery.. unless you wanted to tell me :P oh, and.. it was really really scary walking back... but completely safe (: I hope you had a good night, and I wish you sweet dreams n' stuff (: (The thought of you kept me smiling the entire way home). sorry.. goodnight (:
It's okay (:. I like you lots too . you're amazing (:
Sweet dreams
that's what the note told me
Or it'll kill me. It'll be way too awesome
Oh.. so you only like me with flesh?. Is that it?
Yeah.. but it was okay.. I chose to take the scariest places :P I had a bunch of fun with you too.. you're amazing and the hugs were amazing (:
Being unhuggable.. would be the worst :P
Nah.. I'm like.. so awake o.. o.O. Yeah. Sorry
But like.. really.. unhuggable..
crazy
Yeah :P. It's.. like.. a disorder or something
Exactly. It's all my fault
Thanks. Nah, don't be.. because like.. it was bearable because I thought of you (: (sorry..) Goodnight :D
Aw :/. Shoot. I just.. ruined everything :P
I think so
Because you'll resist hugs more :P. And.. I'm prone to ruining things. I don't know.. you just make me really happy (:
Nah.. it's probably best. I'm pretty bad at hugs too
One of these days.. :P. sorry . I like where we are (:
I don't know
the "perfect hug". Well good, because you make me really really happy (: And like.. I really like you and.. yeah (:
Really?. Oh.. and you are the one that lays close to me
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
:D. sorry :P. You're so.. amazing :3. sorry again... I should probably let you go
All the more reason to leave. I like you too :D
<3. sorry. Yeah..
I thought that was a jelly bean. Oh..that makes sense
I <3 Leandra . (:
Or keep the same name... Because I'm pretty sure I only jellybean you (:
Well you're special all the time. But.. you shouldn't feel that way just being of me. because* maybe. I don't know. sorry... Goodnight (:. You're super amazing
Haha. I'm sorry that you thought too much of me. sweet dreams
most of the time.. the rest of the time it's just lame :P. Bye, talk to you.. whenever I'm lucky to talk to you next
Too bad I gave it away
And yyou're even more awesome. Me neither (:. you're*. sorry..
It'd be crazy if that's how it worked. But it would make me pretty lucky. :P. Anyway.. bye (:
Oh, it's really no problem. I don't think I could be anyone else. Thanks for being you and you're amazing-ness. sorry
What would happen if I were someone else?
nah.. I don't know. Like.. if I weren't me. :P
Ah. oh :P
It's fine. I'm glad you're not anyone else either
Well.. you're definitely nicer. You're like.. the nicest person I know
Nah. You're super nice (:. And I really like you for that
Good (:. Because you're just perfect
(:
It's fine. but you really are (:. No need to waste a wish on that. Because you're just.. so amazing
Me? Bias?. Saying that is like.. saying your opinion is also biased :P
Hmm. I'm not just going to accept that
yes (:
Haha.. I don't know why :P. But if you did.. then thank you . I could probably live in it like Spongebob does
I was just.. assuming that since it'd be like.. prehistoric.. it'd also be larger. However.. that was a dumb assumption. But still... cool (:. Like you. Sorry... I'm going to go before I fall even further for you
sorry . Goodnight (:. Have fun sleeping n' stuff
It get's pretty darn exciting. And.. with enough of it. it'll make someone fully rested for a new day :D. A new day for dog sitting and.. stuff inbetween dog sitting
Are you that loopy right now?. sorry. Yeah.. I don't know what I'm going to do other than dog sit... I can always walk the dog. But like.. I'm kinda scared >:O. anyway.. goodnight again (sorry)
You're cool (:. Umm.. I'll ask later, because it's late.. so.. sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite
What's keeping me?. Sorry. Nothing's really keeping me
Nah, I want to stay up for you. Like.. you're not keeping me. I was going to ask "Maybe we could do something when I'm not dog sitting?". sorry. You're super amazing, bye bye. (:
Oh it's fine (: Yeah, I wish it was warmer too.. but with my sisters BFA show and the dog sitting.. my day will be pretty full until around 8 ish :P Warm days are more fun anyway :P
That does sound like some good news :D And it was alright, some pretty cool art was there. I can't wait for summer either and I'm not sure if I can believe you on the whole "not drinking coffee/oj" thing.. anyway.. I'm off to those dogs again.. and I needa hurry because I over slept :P - Peter :D. Sorry.. but yeah.. it's so nice right now, temperature wise.. it's a little gloomy though :P
Thank you for that :D You're just amazing and the clouds couldn't contain it any longer :P sorry.. Happy Saturday (: I hope it's really nice for you :D. Hi
How are you?
I've been alright
Well.. you know.. getting barked at was alright. I might grow on them eventually
nah. I doubt that
The dog was growling too. I'm pretty sure it wanted to kill me
Who could love me?. I am out of my mind
haha. Clever
Nah.. I was totally quoting a song though :P. But the dogs calm down.. . I'm pretty sure I'm just a face they see and a hand that feeds
Oh, it was like.. graphics, sculpture, jewelery and a bunch of stuff.. like, every artist had their own style; it was pretty neat. And they hadn't been let out.. so that gave me some stuff to do :P Thank you as well, it's going slowly.. but I'm thinking around 7 it'll pick up :D
Well.. so far.. I'm just a face and a hand :P
haha.. yeah. It's enough for anyone to love me by >:O
Yeah, good thing :P
haha, that's a nice prospect on it. Whoa.. there is a song called "Walking the Dog" and I have it o.O And 7 is when Doctor Who is on :P I'm not certain on what the "thingy" is
Wait.. so is there really something happening at 7?. Hmm.. "when the night is dead" sounds.. like it might be morning :P And okay... sorry
It is. so trippy. and I wasn't aware of that stuff going on :P
I was aware :D It's kinda trippy though Rocky road ice cream is awesome.. it's got marshmallows in it which makes it super fun n' stuff :D
Well that's interesting. And to think I was excited for Doctor Who
Haha. Yeah. It's like.. older than the Super Bowl. sorry.. there was a lag with my internet
Yeah. I may be wrong about the super bowl thing though. No, I was right
Doctor who was in 1963 and the first Super Bowl was in 1967
totally
whoa. that's even crazier
I wouldn't doubt it
Okay. I'll just take them out then. jk :P
See.. that's how that joke made no sense :P. hmmm.. the sun looks like it's come to stay. Looks really nice outside :P
Yeah, me too . I wouldn't know what to do though... so I'll probably stay inside
They are with people :P. Or at least 2 people :P. But solo, not so much
I'm pretty sure a majority of the people I know are off and gone. I'm no fun to be with anyway.. so staying indoors will be fine by me
If you say so :P
haha, okay?
sorry for what?
It's fine. You have nothing to be sorry about. You're awesome (:
With David Tennant in it?. If so.. yes. And it's cute :3. haha. And I think you fall into the same category :D
Yeah.. I was kinda lost by it too. But he chased love and in the end he got it. :P
haha. yeah. Did they kiss in the fountain? or am I recalling it wrong?
Oh, so I recalled it right :P. If that was the first time they met.. that would be kinda weird
Wait.. what's real?. I'm so lost
oh. neat
Yeah
You're cool
Nah.. sorry.. I'm rubber. and you're glue :P
I know.. I'm sorry . but that's how it turned out
Glue with a rubber coating. which defeats the purpose of the glue entirely
Yeah, kinda
Oh?. From that telephone commercial?
Ah... and the second one?
Oh, yeah. I was like.. thinking of that song like.. two days ago :P. But I don't recall the title
Haha, it looks so cool. I should show it to my graphics class
haha. It's pretty sweet
Totally. It's rap that's just about being fun.. instead of the lame stuff I hear a majority of the time
Yeah.. I like Kid Cudi though.. he's alright. And B.o.B is pretty cool too
haha. That's.. pretty snazzy
haha. that's good. :P
If there were a will I would get my way And I'd try until. I saw you today . sorry. :P. ..
yeah, sorry
Alright, have fun. I'll stay inside :P
Alright, I hope you have like.. an amazing day
That would be really cool.. I wish I could watch it with you. sorry. Bye I suppose
I would really want to.. and no there isn't. but I wouldn't want to take up your spring break
That's silly talk. Like.. right now.. I'm taking up the time you could be using to be outside
Ah. yeah.. can't have that. :P. Well.. I'll leave you to it. Have a good day and I won't waste any more of your valuable time
Exactly... I'm not worth your time. I'm glad we agree
Nah.. I'm in no way being facetious 
I'm sorry to have caused all this . Oh.. but you're happy about it?
It's probably a nice change of things.. because you're like.. super smart n' stuff
Oh well.. I get that a lot too. I'm not the smartest cookie in the bunch :P. Like.. yesterday I thought it was taste good to put humus on a sugar cookie. or that 401k meant 401,000 instead of the retirement plan. would* taste good :P. see.. right there. messed up
I would believe you
nothing. I'm just an awful person
Still.. me of all people. I should know these things
See. I'm just going to go cry in a corner now
You shouldn't be... just.. leave me. everyone does in the end
It's okay.. I was the person who didn't know... so like.. I should just wither away
Well.. either way.. I don't deserve to know you
I was joking with certain bits of it :P
Yeah :P
Yeah
Like.. I don't deserve you still 
Thanks, but you really don't have to try
To catch them all is my real test
Pokemon, haha
yeah
haha. Yeah. it got stuck in my head too
To be honest.. I was watching something involving pokemon earlier. haha. But thank you (:. You're so amazing. sorry..
It was by Smosh... and yeah. I better like.. . stop wasting your time. :P
You can keep saying that :P. but it won't register
Even then . I'm sorry
haha. that's... a very good point
possibly :P. I still feel bad for wasting your time though.. even if you say I don't. Like.. yeah.. sorry
haha, I don't see how. I'm just an average guy :P. And you're super amazing . so.. yeah
Kinda, yeah (:
Nah, you don't have to do that. Like.. you could probably do something better with your schedule
Again.. you could do something better with your day
Well.. not going to lie.. but that made me smile
haha, thank you. Your smile is pretty amazing 
Alright, that would be cool
Bye (:
oh.. even better :D. :P. have fun (:
Oh.. i'm sorry. my bad. Like.. extremely sorry. Talk about poor timing huh?
Oh.. well if you like.. left to do important things.. then you know. I wouldn't want to keep you
Eh, talking to me isn't important. but cool :D. I was sorta like.. dog sitting.. . And when I got home I had like.. a snack :P
Yeah, but I'm back now :P
A bowl of cereal, some granola bars and 2 sandwiches
Nah.. I ate them separately . but it would have been good :P
haha, I wouldn't recommend it, but cool
haha. I have a feeling you'd be the only survivor 
Is that like.. your power source?
ah well.. just as good. I'd say that I'd want some mushrooms.. but that could be interpreted wrong
haha, yeah. Oh.. 1 hour :p. sorry
Ei, it be a wee bit excitin'. sorry.. :P. I'll shut up now
Yeah. sorry :P
I'm sorry for more than that.. but cool
For being awesome?. just kidding... :P. Umm.. for wasting your time still. I feel like.. you're busy :P
That's not denying that you're busy... So if you are.. I can leave you to it
Says you :P
oh. well.. okay :P. sorry. I should probably go like.. to the dogs again.. you know.. if I want to be able to see you tonight. which might not happen anyways. but.. yeah. anyway*
Kinda. but if your schedule got filled up. I can watch it alone
If you don't want to that's also fine
There's BBCA over here.. or like.. we could do something else
It's cool what?. And I would imagine that they would do that
Well.. I feel like I'd prefer to spend time with you than watch it... but... I suppose I wouldn't be listening to myself if that is what happens
What?
What kind of illegal activities?
Oh.. well.. that's acceptable. except.. not at all
You're a cereal killer?. it's cool if you are. I killed off a bowl this morning
Most people are
You can trust me. your secret is safe with me
Yeah.. me too
Oh.. seems serious. some.. serious cereal . sorry :P
haha. It's alright with me. Everyone has that habit :P. I assume this isn't the "illegal activity" you were mentioning though
Ah.. true
aww. I'm sorry for your computer. I'm probably just.. making things worse. I'll disappear forever if you need me to
Well.. I'll just have to do my best to not disappear then. because I'd hate for you to be sad
I may just have to be closer.. just to make sure
Can never be too safe. Anyway.. am I going to miss Doctor Who for you or what?
No, I'm asking you. Can I please miss Doctor Who to spend time with you?. :P
You're right.... You're more important than Doctor Who. and I'd just be.. wasting your time. I'm sorry for not taking you into consideration
Makes perfect sense.. I think. at least. maybe. Either way.. I was going to miss Doctor Who tonight... So I wanted a better excuse to do so. :P
Those dogs.. . I have to check on them while Doctor Who is on. and if I miss a little.. I won't care about the rest :P. And to be honest.. I would rather spend my time with you. however.. . I'm a boring guy.. who probably smells like dog. And who would want to spend time with that?
Nah. I could go check on them before
Not really.. considering Doctor Who starts now. Already missed the first minute. Which is probably super important to the story line
Oh? Does it?
I thought it started at 7
Nah. I think I'll check on those dogs though. I would really like to spend time with you, but you don't seem like you want to. so.. I suppose I'll just talk to you later
Oh.. it does premier at 9. :P
I really don't care about Doctor Who. so like.. it's fine if I miss it
I do want to. I'm just not sure if I'd be "everything"
If you'd want me to be there. Because I'd love to
Ah.. yeah. I've got shorts on right now :P. Right.. well.. is it really that cold now?. It was warm last I checked
Haha, alright. cool. Well.. I suppose this means I should check on those dogs and then.. meet you at some time?
Nah.. it takes like.. 4 minutes to get to the house. by walking. Then like.. yeah. I think I can manage it. maybe
Last time I checked. I do indeed have legs. Oh wait their gone. holy cow!!. o.O. No.. wait. false alarm, they were just under the desk
Oo! Fun :D
Yeah.. me too. kidding.. of course
I'm pretty sure you'd look fantastic in either one
Thank you
I do, why?
oh. exciting :D. Right well.. okay.. hmm.. 10 do the derivative of 2. hmmm..
Alright.. well.. around 20-30 minutes.. . that would be how long my traveling would be by foot :P. maybe less. but I don't know
Wear for what?
I don't know who that is
and I'm pretty sure you'd look gorgeous in whatever you choose to wear
When would you like me to be over?. If you do at all :P
alright, that gives me plenty of time
I have
Like.. I'm a bottomless pit of course.. so you know >:O. Yeah, see you soon (:
Bye, catchalater
I'll either ring the doorbell.. or karate chop the door down. But most likely just ringing the bell. sorry, bye
It's okay. You're more awesome. sorry. I am still frightened.. so I'm probably going to keep awake for a while. whereas you're probably going to crash :P
It was so scary outside. Like.. I didn't realize it until just then
No, it was just the shadows. and it's fine. I'm willing to accept it :P. You're so amazing (:. Like.. I'm sorry for gazing. and.. sorry for saying that. I'm just.. sorry for everything
Well I don't know... You seem pretty amazing to me. like.. I wouldn't even know why you'd be sorry
You being you is the best thing you could do. I really really like you the way you are n' stuff. And.. you don't really. like.. it's just.. I'm dumb and I over think things
Well, I'll try to keep it in mind.. but it's hard to imagine that someone as amazing as you would like me. And.. I could imagine. but it's all to make your insides clean right?
Haha. exactly. And I like you a whole bunch too. Like.. yeah... umm (:. Eye luv yew. sorry..
You had cookies and didn't tell me?. And.. possible.. that one song. With olives
It's alright.. cookies aren't that great in comparison. and yeah.. i'm sorry
sorry for what? you're amazing (:. And in comparison to you.. like.. I couldn't keep my eyes off you, you're so.. so.. I'm sorry
I don't know.. you seemed to do everything perfectly (:. And nah.... cookies aren't that great . and neither am I
If you weren't so diseased... jk. Sorry. I kinda wanted to hug you and never let go.. because you're amazing and I wanted you to know
I really really really like you too (:. <3. sorry
Yeah... I'm still terrified from outside though. I'll try not to have nightmares. As long as I just think of you a lot. Then I think I should be good
It wasn't so scary. it was more like.. I was going to fall. that sort of feeling. Which scared me
It was like.. it was so dark. I thought I would trip over something. Anyways... I suppose I should let you go . Goodnight and sweet dreams *:. (: *
You too :D. I <3 you (:
sorry. You're so amazing (:. I hope you get better. And become germ free :D. Because.. I really missed that..
missed the kissing >:O sorry.. just kidding :P. You're so much more amazing 
haha.. well.. that must have been a good moment then
Thought so. :p
anyway.. good night, Leandra (:. yay? how good was this moment?
sorry.. I'm confused. but okay (:. Sweet dreams :D
Yeah.. probably. If only I knew :P. you're even more awesome. And I'm really glad you're my girlfriend (:. sorry, bye :D
I'll take your word on it . And that means a bunch too. :3
Night (:
Have like.. amazing dreams an' what not
(:. *sigh** three words :P                     I had an amazing day too, you're so amazing (:. sorry. bye
I'm sorry. I didn't really say anything . but like..
you probably shouldn't anyway
No, it's the best ever (:. You're the best ever. And I really really like you (:
Aw ):. (: *. sorry. no.. it's a good "ew". aw*. wow.. I'm a failure. Goodnight, sleep tight
Word. home slice. ow.. . sorry. bye. (:
(:. I love your existance 
"gootness"?
wow.. sorry. Didn't even notice. wow.. I'm.. sorry
I'm just going to go then
You're so so so so cute n' cool  and sweet and everything neat.. and I'm a dork. sorry, I'll walk away with shame
you are too (:. bye (:
Happy Easter (: It's very sunny and warm.. good day to be the Easter Bunny, bad day to be wearing what I'm wearing :P haha, I hope you have a fantastic day :D. Yeah, I hope your day was amazing, although.. it doesn't end for a few hours.. I still hope it was great (:
Nah.. I was just wearing really warm clothing.. and it was warm out :P I don't think I've ever had a Cadbury Cream Egg before :P Anyways, goodnight and sweet dreams (: I hope tomorrow is nice :P. Not sure if you'd like this.. but I thought it was kinda neat and the lyrics are kinda nice too :P. Hi. Oh.. sorry. Well.. I hope you have a nice day (:. And I may talk to you later if I get the chance :P
Haha, I sort of thought of you.. be that as corny as it sounds :P And you say you have bad timing? I feel like mine is a lot worse
I'm uncertain whether I am or not.. are you? Pictures sound like fun :D
I don't have any excuses either.. but I kinda don't want to go.. but since you'd be there I may reconsider.. And yeah.. sorry :P
You're the only reason to go :P. And no.. I'm not doing anything special 
Nope
I suppose :P
Get over where?
Oh
Ah. well. See you at practice then
I mean.. if you don't want me there... you know. I don't have to be 
Yeah, really cool :P. And maybe.. just maybe I could even see you after practice... or not. you know
Alright. have fun being early
Alright, see you later. I can't wait. (:
Bye
See you soon
Well.. depends really. Probably soon
I suppose :P. I can't wait, haha. I hope it's a fun day
Yeah, just you and me :D. sorry. I doubt it, but it'd be kinda nice
oh, I could pick you up if you needed
Oh, okay, bye. Have fun
Be safe
You're even cooler (:. And..  I took a shower.. because you kept pestering on about that :P
Don't I always?
Just kidding of course. But not touching my hair is probably for the best :P
sorry, but are you typing?
ah. I'm lost by that "aw (:". Like.. because I saw typing. Like.. I thought there was something after it :P
Oh.. it's a secret huh?
Ah. clever. Well.. I suppose since I don't know it's a secret than I don't really need to know :P
(;. (: *. Same with you. but.. I don't think that I'm that amazing . But you are for sure (:
Yeah.. I feel like you can pull through. I was going to say something.. but that'd just waste your time. so I suppose I have my own secret now :P. bye (:
I might..
Maybe
Yup. sorry
... that's a valid point. but it could be a secret because I keep it to myself
I'm 3 people?
Oh. haha. never thought of that :P. sorry. I feel like I'm wasting more of your time not telling you
Oh.. just umm.. I really really like you (:. and I wrote something. but it's not important. so.. you know. bye :P
It's just a song I wrote down. nothing special. It's actually.. super lame. and doesn't even apply to my life
oh well like.. I wish it did :P. but it's still really lame. and corny. and.. not good
Well.. I think you're amazing (:. And in comparison to you.. everything I write just isn't as amazing. sorry..
One of these days. I will be able to verbalize how I think of you. But for now.. I'll just put a little <3. sorry.. but if you really wanted to read the song.. that I thought about.. then.. you know
really?. me too (:. And I wish I could tell you stuff too.. 
A nice mustache nonetheless. And yeah, I like rainy days . Sunny days are cool too though. And then Something Happened Unexpectedly when Your lips met mine  My eyes Aligned With yours My nose  Bumped first But you didn't mind  I don't know if we did it right As our lips were intertwined As our mouths spoke of love I couldn't get enough  I wasn't sure of what to do But somehow I already knew And this was magic When we first kissed. It's.. really bad. by the way. so.. I'm just going to hold my breath until I pass out
sorry. it's.. still not good. And that title was by accident . I don't know why I wrote it... Just thought of it.. randomly
I'm going to attempt to pass out again. At the time I didn't want it to be unrelated. so.. I'll hold my breath
sorry... Anyway.. you should probably get started on that homework
Kinda.. not much of a secret though
Well.. I suppose I should go to jail then. :P
Nah.. I should stay there forever
Why would you want to be in jail?
Well.. just to be with me is no reason to miss out on nutella
The prison probably won't be coed. But if it were. I'd try to sneak in some nutella
Oh I bet. I bet nutella is like.. the currency there
haha. that would be something
Nah, I'm pretty much nothing. Oh, it's fine :P. You're pretty amazing yourself (:
Maybe everything to you :P
Not as much. Not to be corny.. but I think you're my everything
I think it should be true (:. Because you're amazing. That may be like.. a bad reason for it to be true... but either way. You are amazing (:. and you being my everything makes me feel amazing 
Oh. aww. Sorry. My internet died for a while... I tried to say "It's okay, I think you're so amazing and awesome.. and the fact that you find me cool to be around is awesome because that means you'd like to spend time with me n' stuff". sorry
Me too . You're so amazing and spending time with you is super fun. But like.. smelling sweaty and stuff may be like.. a deterrent. for you... Like.. my bad smelling body :P. sorry. I feel like I left out key words in my statement which made it sound bad. And.. I just stubbed my toe.. and it feels.. so great
Yeah.. haha. Like.. I had to stand on my foot just to like.. get rid of the pain. Not sure how that works.. but yeah
I think it was to balance off the pain. like.. add more pain to make it hurt less. :p. I ought to be so prepared. sorry
oh.. nothing :P
just.. quoting a song.. a song of which.. you know
I'm not exactly sure
Ah.. so you know what I'm quoting?
Well.. either way.. the thought terrifies me kinda
Well that song like.. relates in no way :P. but still. Like.. I get this weird feeling when thinking about it.. so I probably should stop
Kinda, yeah. That's a really good way of putting it actually
Yeah.. 
Really?. Well.. it sounds pretty accurate. I keep thinking that feeling with subside.. but.. it kinda doesn't. Sorry.. it probably all sounds lame from me 
Wait.. what if we're not talking about the same thing?. What are you talking about, just to make sure?
somewhat the same thing. however.. I feel like I may be thinking something else. like... in relation to that Hellogoodbye song
Ah.. well.. as long as we're on the same boat. Either way.. it's.. a scary thought. like.. not scary.. but. hmm. I don't know. I'm sorry. Dumb thing to bring up
Intimidating?
ah. well.. I really wouldn't know how to describe it. but like.. it's weird
Yeah.. I like that term. The thought makes me super nervous. But I don't really think about it all that much
You too?
I'm just going to have to throw it out of my music library :P
Well.. not that terrible :P
Yeah. And like.. I know how you are with the whole thing :P
Nah, it's fine. I was just stating that
It's cool, I like hugging you too (:. But being with you is the best
I'll be cool with being awesome for that. because it's a cool game. but I won't accept "being awesome" for much else :P
nah. But thanks for thinking so
I really really really like you too (:. And it's fine. You don't have to say you're sorry. Because I like you too and it's nice to let you now. and to hear :D
I don't want to seem that way either... but you don't
Maybe we're just.. both so clingy that we can't even tell :P
Yeah, we'd be completely unaffected. So.. good for us :D. :P
On that note, goodnight. and sweet dreams (:
You're so amazing. Oh.. nah.. I don't think you'll see me tomorrow
kidding of course
I wouldn't want to miss out on a chance to see you 
They don't affect my day like you do (: 
Well.. it's basically the obvious. Which sets you apart by a lot
I have one. I think we made sure it wouldn't do that though. I think it kept waking people up
Yeah. anyway.. . Sweet dreams (:
Peace homeslice 
If I am ever so lucky. I hope you had a really nice day (: Goodnight n' sweet dreams
Oh whoa? . What?
Oh>. ?*. Really?
Yeah, I'm still confused :P
Oh.. it better be good
Or.. I'll just hate that show forever
Aww. Alright. Well, have fun with that. I hate it so far :P. Bye. I made a comment on that fact to Drew.. Like.. at least one every day for the past week... it's still sad that no one will take them :/
It's just sad because I'd like for once that someone would like one.. I mean.. I know it's not impressive that I find one every so often.. but you know.. I would like to give away the gift.. and today even though I was trying to purposefully not find one.. I found 3 anyway.. I just hate myself... Well.. goodnight, farewell.. sweet dreams and stuff along those lines.. and sorry, for everything.
I hate myself for a completely different reason.. and I think I missed the lightning n' all by crashing too early :P I think I did dream about marshmallows.. if they were magic or not.. who knows... all I know is I should try to get some homework done that I failed to do last night..... Oh goodie.. I get to walk to "Ghetto Playground" for the modeling.. not that you care of course.. not even sure why I'm telling you.. but.. I hope you have an amazing rest of your day and I hope the wedding thing goes over well (: And if I am so lucky, talk to you later.. if not see you tomorrow. I just noticed.. that technically i<3 works mathmatically.. but i<3u really depends on the variable.. sorry.. random/stupid. wow.. it made a heart.. :P. Hiya
How are you?
Ah.. gotcha. well.. I wouldn't want to waste your time then. so.. I am sorry
for being a bother n' such. sorry... Goodnight then
Well.. sometimes I feel like I am. Anyway.. have fun watching the wedding. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I didn't hear about that at track.. I heard that on the radio last night.. and the Ghetto Playground is on Owens Street.. the one by your house is pretty cool in my opinion (:  The photography thing went pretty well I suppose.. took a lot of time though.. I'm not ready for tomorrow.  If only it made a heart.. then I'd be saying what I mean...
nah
Sounds nice so far. I'm yours tonight. Anyway.. I'm still sorry. so.. I shouldn't keep you from anything
I'm sorry for apologizing... I <3 you           . sorry. wow. bye. umm.. see you tomorrow .     Sweet dreams
sorry about that.. even though I meant it to be a heart.. see ya. If you're like.. a zombie tomorrow. you'll still be amazing and awesome to be around
No doubt you'll pull it off. Because you're "cute to boot"
sorry.. no, I didn't, but it's a quote anyway and it completely applies.. anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams until you experience that once in a life time moment
I mean like.. you're cute also (:. but yeah.. bye. Oh.. and you're boots are cute too :P
Me too :P. I would agree though.. even though it might not mean much from me. farewell
I'm just another guy.. so I don't know why
Oh no.. I got it.. but just.. never mind. see you tomorrow. I hope the royal wedding is awesome. I could find out myself... but... you know. I don't even know where to find it :P. sorry... Anyway.. I hope you have a really good rest of the day and that it involves really awesome stuff :P I kinda, honestly, wanted to do something.. but I can tell you're busy.. so anyway.. I hope everything is amazing (:
Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting anything. I hope it does.. and I don't know of the movie that you speak of :P either way.. I wouldn't want to take up your time :P
Oh, just checking. I wouldn't want to bother you
You wouldn't want to bother yourself?. :P. I really don't think you could bother me. Oh, well you wouldn't be taking up my time :P And I doubt that.. you with nothing important to do? That's just crazy, whereas me on the other hand.. I never have anything important :P
Tend to do what often?. I'm slow. sorry
gotcha. I couldn't tell. my bad. Well.. you probably have something more important to do than talking to me.. so.. yeah..
It's just the internet.. so.. I wouldn't blame that. I could've caught it easier in person. maybe
Well.. maybe we just need to be talking in person. that way you'll know. sorry.. I doubt you'd want that :P
Yeah.. and maybe so that I could see you :P. sorry
Well.. I doubt today works for you :P. So.. I don't know if I'll even ask
I mean like.. you know.. if you'd be up to seeing me today :P. But I doubt it
Whoa.. May the 4th be with you. Well.. that's super important.. so.. if you're working on it now, then I'll leave you to it
I'm not distracted... I'm just not doing anything. I wish.. never mind. I'm a terrible person.. bye
Nah. I wish that I could see you later.. but you know.. I'm a terrible person . Sorry
Well yeah.. I figured that I wouldn't be able to see you later.. I just.. wanted to :P. And I can see you run amazingly. I still think I am though :/
Well.. wanting to see you isn't that crazy is it?. And I'm a terrible person.. because I'm not good enough.. and I do everything wrong
It's kind of hard to mess of cereal... And nah.. I'm not cool.. and everything I do is the wrong way
Nah.. I'm lame. And no where good enough for you
Don't be using your spanish skills on me
For all I know you're disagreeing with me
sorry. Ah gotcha.. I really need to stop doing my homework at school.. it leaves me with nothing to do at home.. haha, I could always brush up on Tony Hawk :P
Me too.. just.. I always feel the need to be sorry for something. Because I always feel like I'm messing everything up
I don't know why I should. Okay.. I have like.. an idea of one thing.. but still
Still, I don't feel awesome
I feel average.. at best
I was thinking you are a reason to feel awesome. sorry.. again.. I'm lame
Well thank you for being amazing then. And I'm sorry for being a corny dork
Well like.. I don't know. This is why I'm a terrible person. Sorry.. just.. my heart races when I think of you.. and I feel bad that like.. I don't know
I just don't feel good enough.. I feel terrible that you'd be wasting your time. sorry. I shouldn't feel that way
Well.. if you say so. I suppose it's hard to believe some times. But.. I'll try and hold to your words
Why not the left hand?
Oh.. well I'll take your word
I'll try to. You're awesome too (:. And amazing... and everything. sorry
Wait.. . umm.. never mind. bye
goodnight n' sweet dreams
I can't make you wait.. because like.. you said you needed to go
It's not that important.. . So I'm sorry for wasting your time
Fine.. well like. You said "bye friend" and like.. sometimes that's exactly how I feel.. just a friend you know.. even though like.. I love.. talking to you and spending time with you.. I just think you're really amazing and that I really like you.. but sometimes I just.. I don't know.. like I said it's not important.. in fact if I hit enter I'm completely surprised because I kinda wanna send this but I kinda don't at the same time.. sorry a billion times
Sorry. Like I said.. it wasn't important
But that's it right?
yeah. Confuses me even more. but okay. I won't hold you any further
I don't even know what it means.. which may be bad. I don't know. But.. my heart is all.. twisted.. it kinda hurts. But you know.. you said you had to go
I don't know.. I'm so confused
Maybe you could. but you also could have added boy.. but I don't think that would have changed it much
I don't know. Like.. I just feel like another guy sometimes
Well thank you 
sorry for what?
Haha. nah it's cool. My self doubt gets the best of me and it leaves me like this
And?. Being silly is cute :P
Yes.. very glitchy.. I'm uncertain of which kind you speak.. but I have to say you're super cute.. sorry.. and thanks for clearing that up, but I feel like another one because I sorta am kinda in a way.. anyway, see you at that track meet, goodnight and sweet dreams. Yes.. very glitchy.. I'm uncertain of which kind you speak.. but I have to say you're super cute.. sorry.. and thanks for clearing that up, but I feel like another one because I sorta am kinda in a way.. anyway, see you at that track meet, goodnight and sweet dreams. so glitchy it sent that twice :P
nah.. I walked home.. and it was scary. Oh, hey. :P
Guess who just got back! :D
Me :P. And to think.. I thought I had extra time to do stuff
Well.. I ran a little bit
if I walked the entire way I probably would have gotten home later. and I got lost
so that was a problem
Well didn't you say your mom was busy?. I wouldn't want to get in the way of anything. My legs are noodles
well.. oh well. Too late now :P. I didn't even get to swing on any swings :/
A phone for what?. I was pretty much stuck either way
It's fine. it's all in the past now :P
What?
Umm.. okay
I wish I'd have one..
what's with all the sad faces?
I only got lost for like.. a mile or so. it's no big deal. I wanted to spend the rest of my Saturday with you.. however... thinking back on it you already spent a lot of time with me.. so boredom probably commenced 
sorry.. anyway. I hope the rest of your night is fun n' stuff
Nah.. . It probably won't be. I'm still catching my breath. You would not believe what I had to do to actually find my way home
Umm no... I just guessed
so I got lost several times
And I had to hop over a lot of stuff
and I think I was illegally trespassing at several times
Yeah... So I'd understand if you never wanted to see me again
I thought I could get home faster by cutting through.. turns out. It didn't work that way. Good thing I have Tony Hawk and brownies here.. or else I would just be dead on the floor
Exactly. However, Tony Hawk is boring if you don't have someone to play with. so.. I basically just have brownies to aid me. but that is just as good I suppose
Nah. I'm actually pretty much alone :P
Like.. without you on facebook.. I'd be alone in a dark house
Which is fine, seeing how you said you needed to go get water. so I'm alright :P
I'm sorry. I'm just a terrible person. I don't mean to be sad inducing
Nah. It was my choice. however stupid it might have been. I mean.. my brother is still working and my parents have yet to return home. So.. I didn't have one and I knew it. and mooching off you for a ride is silly
Well.. like.. I don't want to be a hassle for your mother. And seeing me isn't that great
Well.. you said that just by talking to me you were getting sad. so.. yeah. that's what i was going to say
I should just stop bothering you and let youeat that water
you eat*
no problem. I'm.. still tired >:O
as you should.. you had an awesome meet. My sunburn however.. really kinda hurts
so.. I'm going to wait out sleeping for a while :P
I don't think I have any. In fact.. pretty sure I don't
If only I were there. Too bad I'm here :P 
I don't think you'd want me there :P
I thought you were . I was hoping you weren't... but I thought you were
nah. Not really. I kinda meant like.. I'm still smelly and sweaty. really really sweaty. so like.. you wouldn't want me there because of that
I essentially ran from the middle school to my house with my backpack and a lunchbox 
I'm not so much sweaty any more
but.. very stinky :P. Nah.. it kinda felt like a 5k
yeah
I can tough out the pain though. I wouldn't want to bother you any further :P. even if you say I don't
Well.. I'm not really sad. I'm just sort of in pain. and stuck at home
Well.. if I had some.. you know. totally would
sounds like a great idea. You probably just have to put some in the cd tray. and download the attachment and send it through email
I was thinking that. also
as an alternative
haha sweet. it's like.. a fire on my arm. like.. it's not really painful it's just.. burning. oh well. since you have to eat some water and go to bed. I'll just have to bear through it
I wouldn't want to keep you. I'm not as important
that and sleeping
A little bit. I would like to test this theory. but if it was true. then it'd make me sad :/. so far I've been like.. sick for most 2 days
so you know how it is :P
I'll try not to. I was sick for 5 days straight. but that was a long time ago. Anyway. being "me-deprived" can't be a bad thing. and even though I'd really like to see you and get some aloe vera... I'm pretty sure I'm just going to have to deal with the pain. It's better than emotional pain :D. Did you know you can't experience more than one form of pain at one time?
maybe. if it's bad enough. But it was like.. in elementary school. and I think so.. the cutting thing :P
I did have a brownie.. so you may be on to something
Spending time with you always makes things better. No matter how corny that sounds
Well.. It makes me want to see you too. (:
so it's settled.. tonight 10 o'clock. just kidding. :P 
Me too :P
Sleepover?!?. jk again
Well.. if only, if only :P
haha. that. And if only you were serious :P. oh.. and if the park were as soft as the clouds in the sky. :P
I kinda doubt that :P. And I honestly don't know the rest . unfortunately
ah yes thank you. it's still really amazing. like you (:
Sad face?
I think you're super amazing
Like.. you shouldn't think you're not
Aw. Well.. if you don't want to say it, then don't. I'm curious, no doubt. but I don't want to force words out of your hands
Yeah. had to do it. I mean.. I wish we were talking instead :P. because that would imply being with you. (or on the phone, but I'd still get to hear your voice)
Yeah.. I'm kinda of.. sad that you're sad.. but I don't want to pry
Ah, well. I hope not. It's sad when you're sad. so I'll try whatever in my power to keep a smile on your face
Totally. I really care about you n' stuff. so.. yeah (:
Well.. you aren't. I feel the same way sometimes. Wait.. you are 1 person out of a bunch. one person that sticks out
one that caught my eye and enterred my life
I'll take that as a compliment. I wish it weren't so late... I kinda want to see you know. now*
Well.. I'm completely available. but I'm not sure if it was completely possible
Yeah, if only. There's always tomorrow if your not too busy. But tonight if you really want to . Kinda doubtful though
Aw . well.. . Maybe you'll just have to wait then. Because a "study date" wouldn't be that beneficial :P
I mean.. we're studying two different things
I wouldn't be able to help all that much. I mean.. I could try. but I'd just be a distraction. I really wish that it were possible. but I'm just trying to be sensible and I feel like.. I know for a fact that if you were to ask your mother would decline
Well either tonight or tomorrow. and yeah.. it's too late tonight and tomorrow you're too busy. Anyway.. I suppose you're busy now too. so I'll just let you go. and be on my way. goodnight and sweet dreams
I don't really have to. I just don't feel like I should be consuming your time. and I doubt it could be that silly. plus.. having a conversation with me can't be that great.. so. yeah 
ah.. my burn :/. oh.. and.. nah :P. not fun :P. sorry.. I seriously feel like I should go. Because this really silly thing doesn't seem so silly in my perspective. so.. yeah.. love you, goodnight and sweet dreams
"Really silly thing". I really wouldn't know... the one you mention
that's interesting
And I'll trust you
yeah. kinda :P. There's a streak of white skin where my watch used to be :P
probably not. I'll try my best though
haha. good point. I can't wait for next week. end*. you know.. ap exams will be over and it's like.. a 3 day weekend right?. I may be mistaken of course. but the first bit makes it fantastic anyway. I kinda want to go take a really really really cold shower. :P. you didn't need to know that, sorry. anyway.. I feel like I've wasted enough of your time.. so. I guess I'll bid you adue or however they spell it :P. adieu*. not even close. on that fail.. goodnight (:
haha, maybe. Have a fantastic night full of amazing dreams and have a fantastic day tomorrow. If time is allowed... who am I kidding.. see you on Monday. bye
haha.. I'll just dream of you then... not to sound like a creeper or anything. nah.. totally creepy.. sorry. I'll just shut up and go now and try to keep hope. :P
nah.. dreaming of the girl of my dreams is just the thing to do :P. sorry. But yeah, you're amazing. And thinking about you makes my heart flutter :P
Keep thinking that. but I think you're really amazing
Very inspirational. And I really believe you are.. but I suppose you're not going to trust me
no it really is
But it's not the same in English. Well.. that's depressing
The spanish version rhymes. Nah.. it's sad that you don't see what I see. Unless this is revenge for all those times that I said that I wasn't amazing n' stuff related to that sort
Good point. And maybe that's why I can't believe I'm amazing :P. Because then I wouldn't be
Well.. you believe what you believe, I'll believe what I believe. I think it's a fair trade off
what?
I somehow.. find that hard to believe. kinda
Yeah?
Yes, so much (:. I don't even know why you'd need to ask
Do you like.. not care about me?
Because.. you know. I don't know
Well.. saying "I wish you didn't". that's.. depressing
Would you like to talk about it?
How did it get bad?
I'm sorry. I kinda want an explanation.. but. you know. I don't want to be bothersome . I'm just.. an awful boyfriend.. so.. I suppose I understand
You haven't done anything to be an awful girlfriend. I'm sorry if it's something I said.. . I just feel like I'm to blame
Don't tell me it's that "You're too good for me" thing. You can tell me the thingy. I'm really confused. I'm sorry
No no no. none of that
Well.. trust me.. you are the best.. and if I know anything about my "depressisodes" then I may have an idea of how you feel
You may have.. but I rarely catch hints
Really?
Which is?. Like.. if I knew more.. I don't know. I keep thinking I hear you say things.. but I don't want to respond because I don't know for sure
I'm completely lost. were any hints dropped today?
I don't know either. I'm pretty sure you're writing a book in my mind but you're skipping chapters
Awesome
Yes. because without those chapters I don't get the whole story. and I become confused
And it tends to cause "depressisodes"
Well.. for starters. sometimes I think you don't like me all that much. and then you know.. makes me feel like you're just done with me. And like.. that's sort of what I kind of conclude when I'm not like.. filled in
Well I don't feel like it
Is this the like.. entire thing.. or is this a bypass?
Well.. like.. I don't feel like an awesome person, you know.. I've never thought that. but when I'm around you.. I feel amazing
I mean like.. heart wise. Like.. you make me so happy and it's really hard to describe. Like.. I'd say you're the greatest girlfriend any guy could possibly ask for.. because you just make peoples days brighter, including mine. And that makes me the luckiest guy ever
Well.. I wish you'd just.. I don't know think about that
No like.. you make me strive to be a better person.. just so I could be in your league.. and you just make me happy because you're there for me and I can tell you care. You're the greatest girlfriend ever, that's what you need to hold on to
It's fine.. does that actually mean something. the whole "left hand" thing?
Just checking. sometimes it seems like it's an inside joke
ah. just checking. Anyway.. I hope that cleared things up at least a little
Do you question if I like you or not? because I really do.. but I heard that you just need to look in their eyes or that their smile tells you
Well like.. it's probably really hard to tell on guys. Because guys are supposed to be "tough". But no one makes me smile like you do
Like.. I'm sorry if I don't clearly show you... I deserve you (:
Well there's no one quite as special as you. You're perfect. But I'm really sorry that I don't show it enough
I keep getting told that
Well.. maybe. I can't just say it is. I feel like that'd be bad and narcissistic . But whether I am or not.. I'm yours no matter what. If that's what you want of course
You're not taking me from anyone else. I'm giving you myself and my heart
I feel like you've had it for a while. I just hid it in your coat pocket. and you're now just finding it
haha, sure. (:. To quote Enchanted.. "I never loved nobody else I never had anyone waiting on me" "It was enchanting to meet you"
Oh, I hear it. I should go check it out!
oh nevermind
Yeah :D
oh, I'm so sorry that I kept you this long. I hope you're better now n' happy
Nah, people came home. And I'm pretty happy. I'm still kinda worried about you though
(I was told that jealousy is something that shows that someone likes you.. but I suppose anyone could be jealous). Well.. I'll trust you on that. and bid you farewell. (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams
I hope tomorrow goes well for you (:. And please believe me . sorry, bye (:
(:. Talk to you later-ish. oh, and I trust you a lot too 
Well.. I'm just going to trust that it won't be. But.. trusting me is pretty bad if you couldn't tell from that "trust fall". If you can't trust me to catch you.. I really don't know what you could. :P
I do trust you. And you could. But again.. I trust you. I'm unsure if it sent the first time. And eating that sandwich didn't take much trust seeing how I had to eat one too :P. But yeah.. just trust me on that. and sorry... Goodnight again. Oh.. sorry, but like I wasn't covered.. but it's okay :P And I was just checkin' n' all.. (Meant to send that last night :P) sorry for.. stuff
Well that's good. I suppose :P
I'm glad you trust me that much :D
Well, I'm glad. Anywho.. how has your day been?. Oh yeah.. it was so crazy.. It was quite the adventure.. although.. I was terrified because I thought I was lost.. but it was neat to know that I could get home the way I went :P
Doing what else? Homework? :P . And mine has been.. slow. And my sunburn still hurts. but it's alright
Haha.. I guess it's not homework, huh?
So what is it?. Sorry.. don't mean to pry. sorry.. I can go if you want
Oh?. Well.. I'd think that'd be fun too (:
Don't you have homework though?. Or anything else more important?. I wouldn't want to get in the way of that
I'd be honored to be your muse
Someone posted up a video of a person running for a Class office. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25R-1tOfRkM. If you're laptop still doesn't work.. then I'm sorry. but like.. that looked like a cool video. Wait.. that's to "entertain". so.. it might not work out
Ah... yeah, gotcha. Original stuff is always the best
Yeah
:d. :D *
Well.. anyway.. I wouldn't want to get in the way of anything, you know?
No like.. hmmm. I mean spending time with me isn't quite as important 
Well.. that's a good point. but wouldn't I be a distraction?. The sun finally came out (:
haha. Alright. Go :P
I know, exciting :D
haha, are you serious?
Ah... Gotcha. Well.. I didn't think you were serious, but awesome (:
haha, alright
Umm.. I unfortunately do not. I have like.. a purple one that has a bunch of glitter on it :P. And I have a red blanket . but no red cape
Haha.. are you trying to be superman (supergirl in your case) or something?
Ah. gotcha. did your mom say no?
So it's a no?
but she didn't say yes. :P
Well okay. I mean.. it's cool :P
haha, if you'd like. And alright.. I'll set off on my adventure now I suppose
Alright, see you then (:
It's both
Oh.. it's just a scratch.. and I fell in a creek
Oh.. that's a movie
which ironically was in my suggestion side on facebook
I know. So I had to like it. :D. And.. I hope you weren't too worried.. but I went the unknown path
you know.. because if I were to die.. it wouldn't have mattered :P. Aside from trespassing on multiple accounts.. it was pretty chill. I'm sorry.. for speaking.. and for distracting you and wanting a hug and everything else that there possibly be.. I'm sorry.. I feel kinda bad over the matter to be completely honest.. and I went the unsafe way
No where close to that smiley. more like O:)
Yup :P
:D
Ah.. well.. awesome :D. See you tomorrow n' such. I'm sort of sorry and stuff, but I'll let you go 
Wait? Why?
When was the first time?. I have this thought.. but it's silly. And I meant let you go eat n' stuff. because that's important
Hmm.. well I wouldn't want to make my assumption on what I think it is. but if I'm right.. then yeah.. it wasn't good letting go
Well.. I wouldn't say so. but you may think differently. I'm sorry for like.. keeping you out in the dark for so long. And.. asking for that hug thing
Yeah.. I thought so... sorry
So.. bad in public?. I thought you thought it was bad always :P. And.. nah.. I'm like.. a terrible person
Well like.. I like hugging you.. so that's a check on the "bad list". and I went the route you specifically told me not to go on
And I'm also pretty bad at showing how I feel.. so yeah.. I'm pretty terrible. but alright. Bye (:. You're fun to be with too :D
No I'm not, but you are. Goodnight and sweet dreams. and see you tomorrow hopefully
Well you should. Bye (sorry for keeping you for so long)
You're neat too. (:. bye
haha. okay :P
Nah. it's okay. It was nice talking to you again :D. My wish didn't come true.. but I think things are starting to make sense. and.. bye again.. I think
Like.. kinda.. I think anyway. and my wish was really stupid. and it was off one of those dandelion things. so it coming true was like.. doubtful
Apparently not.. . But still.. it's best that it didn't though. Like.. because things make more sense now. sorry
Nah.. it was gross :P
In both of ours :P. sorry
Because prior to the knowledge I have now.. I was like.. "It might be worth it"
sorry. but.. it may involve like.. kisses or something
Umm.. is it what you were thinking?
Umm.. I hope what you may have or may not have been thinking wasn't anything bad
So is that what you were thinking?
Alright.. phew :P. Yeah.. that's what I meant. sorry. I know better now though. I think
You watch way too much tv don't you?. Like.. a bunch of "teen drama" shows?
I thought you watched like.. Glee and DeGrassi and what not. Oh.. umm.. nothing :P
Well still. You used to
Random happy face?
Oh.. distrust of boys n' such may derive from shows such as that
haha. good point. very good point. but still
the shows can't help
Well.. he tends to be like.. a nerd. So.. I suppose I'd fit :P. I don't know.. I'm sort of coming up with a theory :P
Exactly. And since you already knew what I was coming up with.. . I assume you still do
Well ish.. still not good. Like.. kissing only leads to the worst things.. and I'm a boy.. so of course you're going to think I'm up to no good. So I don't blame you. Which that explains why you prefer "friend"
again with the ish. Meaning you doubt what you say
and mostly. a limiting word. And not up to no good is a double negative. meaning "I'm sure you'd be up to good". ah
Sorry. I just got it
But yeah.. the limiting words. Just means no good for me. But I think I understand things
Alright.. hmm. Alright.. since there are tv shows out there.. and guys just get a general bad rep. I start off with distrust. so like.. I think anyway. you're afraid that I'll just turn out to be another one of those guys out there.. one who's just there to "play" you and break your heart. or something along those lines. And although I try to reassure you I don't think you'll really ever believe me
And with that quote "They're only after one thing"
you know.. guys get a bad rep from that. Well.. no 
but like.. a bad thing. But I am (:
All I really want is your heart. and like.. if I get it piece by piece, then that's fine
See.. I kinda feel like I won't get it all. and that ":/" face makes me think that. Like.. I feel like no matter how much I try to tell you . You'll still like.. have that image of a guy in your head
Well I understand that too. so basically what I'm gathering is that you'll never completely trust/love me. so I'm left as just another guy
Not enough though.. not enough to convince you. Like.. most likely.. in your head I'm still just a guy. and "just a guy" in your head is that terrible kind of guy. the one that'll only hurt you. Not to lie.. but that kind of hurts me.. . but I'll live I suppose
Alright.. well.. before you I never really liked anyone. I don't know why. But then I saw you. and there was something about you. You were funny.. and really nice. It was kind of hard not to like you
I'm sorry. But it was more of a crush before.. . But I've really gotten to know you. and all the time spent with you 
But now.. I really really like you. Like.. you're just amazing . And I could tell.. ish
I've noticed.. you've gotten really good. Like.. I'm not going to lie.. but I didn't go to basketball games or football games until I knew you went :P
Like.. I heard that you and Twe would go, if I recall correctly. So I decided I would show up :P
Oh yeah. you mentioned it and I was like "I think I might go". :P. "It's like.. (:". Were you going to say something after that or was it the smile?. Because I feel like I could have interrupted you
Really?. Something good happen?. Sorry.. I should stop asking questions and just let you go. So.. bye (:
See you tomorrow
You too, sweet dreams (:. I hope I was informative in any way at all.. because if I was that means I also created clarity for myself. sorry, I'll shut up, it was great talking to you (:
Oh well.. that's good. Like.. being informative. And I'm kinda glad.. but some distrust is always good I think, maybe. sorry.. I really should shut up
Yeah.. but thank you. You're awesome too (:. I kinda can't wait for tomorrow.. bye :D
haha.. I think you'll get votes for the pokemon reference
Nah.. there are a bunch of poke-lovers
Aw.. I think I used to have one. Oh.. borrow Tim Grants. He won one during a XC meet. it's huge
Oh!.. and I think Gap has one!!
Nah.. he won it while we were at Kings Dominion. Gap's is smaller though
Gaps*. Anyway.. I love what you've got so far
Well.. I feel like it'll be great . Except for what I filmed today. Like.. because of my poor filming work. You were great of course
If only it could be entertaining. and edited well :P. Oh well
Anyway.. see you tomorrow
Yeah, I can't wait :D. and yeah, can't wait for tomorrow either
Especially since I'll see you again (:
G'night :D
No problem?. Thank you for the same 
haha. it sounds really cool. I can't wait to see it
Yeah, the best beat boxer I knew was Joey Kleiner.. and he graduated last year
He was on the track team. it was pretty neat. it was like I was listening to the radio
It was so crazy. the amounts of sounds and how many he could make at the same time. it was amazing. But yeah.. I hope your student teacher is there for you.. just so everything goes swimmingly
Same here
I can only do high hat
you could always get a group of people to create an orchestra behind you. and yeah!. Nerdy grabs the peoples attention
They could just be random people you find. And all these rules are lame :/. Crampin' yo style dawg
umm.. not really. And yeah, sorry for keeping you for so long
Well alright. regardless, it was great talking to you still :. (: *
See you tomorrow n' such. have fun :D
haha.. I thought of beard
Haha.. if you did it'd be like:  "Unlike Lincoln I don't have a beard But just like him I come prepared". And with like.. the approximate rhyme
it could work
haha. that's great too. I can't wait to hear what you come up with
I'm kind of inspired by you now :D
At the least a school, for sure
I think you deserve it as much as any body
Don't think so negatively . the school would be lucky to have you as secretary
and along with relationships.. I'm lucky to have you (:
Well.. you're the secretary.. not so much the president
Yeah, but important nonetheless
Exactly. Making you a great candidate
haha. get a lightbulb from that idea?
Oh it's fine
Sorry for rapping to myself. :P. And yeah, you're fun to talk to too (:
and I'm glad to motivate you. I did. I so wrote my own rhymes and everything. But like.. if I were you :P. What I wrote is really lame though :P
Yeah.. I wish I could inspire you though
haha.. I'll write them down then.. so I remember . So why don't you take a seat And mark on the ballet and vote for me Just stay right there, wait and see And I'll prove that I should be secretary. That's the only relative stuff I have though. Everything else is silly :P
Oh, sorry. my bad :/
I probably do the same. but I'm sorry
You shouldn't hear my rhymes then.. :P
Wow.. I wrote ballet >:O. Haha.. it's a real word so no help from spell check. :P. I'm a failure :P
anyway, bye :D
Have a fantastic night :D
Sweet dreams . an' stuff
Sorry.. I was away :/ talk about poor timing There was this one doorknob that looked cool :P And I have an elephant shaped jar in my room :D Anyway.. I hope you have a bunch of fun with the palmer and such, maybe other stuff too and I'll try and find cookies, if I don't have any I'll bake some
Haha, yeah.. being home alone is pretty eventful for that kid.. I normally just sleep :P And okay, goodnight, sweet dreams and I can't wait to see you tomorrow (:. Have fun editing and whatnot.. I hope I was helpful.. at least a little bit anyway :P Anywho.. I hope you had and will continue to have a good day :D. Oh.. and it's starting to storm :D Which is kinda cool :P
Yeah, it is.. I didn't see you at school today :/  it was kinda disappointing... but I hope your day was good nonetheless :D. Sorry.. but yeah I really hope the video turns out well, I'd like to see it :D  Even though I was there to see it, I just.. I need to see it in video form :P. I hope no elephants are troubling you :P sorry.. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams (:
Oh well.. I mostly just missed you n' all But yeah, I can't wait to see it :D I bet that it's amazing and everything (: And I hope your day has gone well. /is going well :P. Oh, and I almost forgot.. good luck on your ap exam!. Hey, I don't want to take up too much of your time.. but I just want to wish you good luck n' everything
Oh yeah.. I had some Salsa Verde to celebrate :P
I don't know... I would assume it's from like.. peppers or something
Yeah.. I am not going to do well on this exam. but I did alright on a few practice ones.. and I've studied. But yeah.. totally going to bomb it :P
What else is there? :P
Hitler should be like.. common knowledge :P. 3rd Reich, National Socialist Party. all that jazz. I feel like you'll do great :D
National Socialist Party=Nazi
3rd Reich was what he was the leader of. Which is Nazi Germany
Who needs luck?. When you've got the answers?!?. just kidding.. :P. I probably need it, good luck for you too :D. And just think.. when it's over.. just smiles everywhere
Yeah.. my art reception is tomorrow :P. not that that has any relevance . anyway.. good luck again
get some sleep, sleep is the most important. Oh.. the one downtown
Nah.. it's really bad
Oh dear..
It'd be silly to go there just to see it. Because it's really not that good. Anywho.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:. We should celebrate after the exam.. if you wanted.. :P
I had no idea about those until now (and painted is just looks worse). And I'll keep that in mind
I won't :/. :P. But yeah, I doubt the likelihood that I'll see you tomorrow.. so see you maybe. Bye (:
Just saying.. I have a morning exam, you have the one in the afternoon.. and you'd probably be busy after school
Is that a quote or are you very poetic and good with words?
Well.. sounds very nice. :D. My hearts a lame place and couldn't form words that way. :P
I gotcha. Well, that's nice of you to say. Althought magical marshmallow clouds have to be a lot better :P
Haha, thanks. good luck to you too and goodnight. And I will see you tomorrow if I am ever so lucky.. 
It'd be my misfortune if I missed out on you. sorry..
Well I've never had one before.. however.. oddly rings a bell. Too bad I have that art reception tomorrow :P. sorry.. goodnight :D
yeah.. you might just have to search downtown :P. At 5 ish
Yeah, you too :D. bye
Bye more awesome person :D
So true. See you later. or not.. my bad
I was planning on just disappearing for a while
If I reappear, just kidding :P. bye . sorry :P
fist bump?
Well.. I'll try to for however long that fist bump needs to be
then disappear again
you too. I've got a clover. and a rabbits foot. which.. is a little sad
Haha?
Oh, haha. sorry :P
Which thingy?
Went well, how'd yours go?
Just well :P and that's good :D
It's fine. :D. Well.. it sounds like quite the adventure
Yeah, but there was like.. a hole in the middle of mine. so it tore all funny. Oh.. gosh.. it's 5
I don't think I need to be there immediately. so.. I can wait a little bit. I'm drawing something anyway
Only could submit 1 piece . I'm drawing this for graphics
Possibly? Possibly?. Sorry :P
Would it be weird if I said I hated it?
Oh.. well.. I don't hate it :P. I actually find it to be quite the amazing substance
That's too bad
Hmm.. ritz crackers?. just kidding... that would be really soggy. I kinda.. don't want to go to this art reception
Well.. I kinda just want to continue doodling. And.. you won't be there :P. Bad.. reason to not want to go. but the last one I went to was.. well.. it was okay... but the one before wasn't that great
Oh.. it was just boring
I would be the only one there who'd want to play ;/. :/ *
Not really.. there are going to be kids from other schools.. that I won't know. And a lot of the people in my class are busy
Not that I'd want to :P. I might just drop by, look at everything.. and then disappear like I said I would
Aw.. okay
I suppose.. umm yeah.. it's fine. and never mind. Bye
I just.. possibly wanted to see you later.. but you're busy... so it looks like that one encounter in the hallway was my only opportunity.. sorry, anyway.. have fun n' stuff. later
Well.. I wouldn't want to ruin your day and rain on your parade
It had one of those?. Too bad I missed it. :P. any who.. I'm just wasting more of your time.. so I'll just go to that reception thing. Have a great rest of your day :D
You did.. 
I won't :p. I'll be there and I'll go 
I wish you could too.. . but my painting is really bad.. so I wouldn't want you to see it
nah.          Anyway.. have fun with.. I don't know what you're doing :P. but.. have fun with it anyway :D
It's like.. near the lyric. like.. past it
but before you get to Souvlakis. It's next to the vegetarian restaurant.. that's all I know
Me too.. but I lost my cards :P
Whoa.. . that's neat :D. And I finished my "doodle". ish... But for now.. finished (:
It's of Winnie the Pooh
Yeah.. it's not
That's why it's not good
No.. because of what I did..
Yeah.. they're..... zombified
Oh.. I suppose. They're actually all zombies.. like.. night of the living pooh
Probably :P
haha. I mean.. that's the first thing I would have thought about 
Sorry.. you said that you had to go a while ago... sorry
It's until 8. I think
Nah.. I feel like people leave early.. like I will :P. And.. I hope whatever you're doing is a real rager :P. sorry..
haha. totally. *sigh**. alright.. well.. I suppose I'll talk to you some other time.. a time I'm unaware of
yeah.. :/. fun :P. .... bye
sure.. let's go with that
umm.. I'm not going to answer that... sorry.. bye
umm.. possibly. but I'm just going to go.. so I don't trouble you
Sure I am... Oh.. and I still want to see that video :P. And.. I'm going to go.. so that I stop taking up your time
That's awesome :D. I suppose I can always wait to view it.. if it got approved n' everything
I.. can't wait that long.. but I'll try
I mean.. it's fine if you want to see it... It's just.. it's really bad. and.. I wouldn't want you to like.. use up your time to like.. see art. I mean.. it'd be worth it to see the other stuff. but.. sorry
Mine's just a blob. but if you choose to go.. that'd be cool
I have no idea. I'm going as is. so if there is one.. then you know. I'll just.. go back home :P
Haha.. that too
Yeah.. so.. see you.. maybe. unless you find something more important. which is pretty easy to do. Sorry.. I'm just going to.. go now :P
Bye. Have a great day regardless :D
I think I should bring a sketch book.. . and it all depends really
Yeah, haha. Talk to you later if I am ever so lucky
I feel like carrying a rabbits foot around would be creepy... but I feel like I'd be pretty lucky to talk to you (:
Well that'd be really cool
haha. oh really now?. Am I that special?. :P
haha. well.. I'll try and take your word on it. but.. I found myself a sketchbook..
so.. you know what that means..
I suppose so. To see him too
So.. bye for now. or.. always :P. just kidding :P
oh.. sorry. any who.. . I hope I didn't startle you too bad. but I should head off now... I suppose. reluctantly
sorry for leaving on such short notice
and I can't tell if the "aw" is in astonishment or disappointment
Or.. "aw.. finally" :P. bye 
A yes to what?
Well.. I wish I could see you later.. but I wouldn't want my wish to interfere with anything. Plus.. you'd get the short end of the stick.. so. yeah.. bye. and.. yes.. it was a yes?. :P
haha.. I don't know what the yes is for.. to be honest. :P. or what the "yay" is for. but bye. Oh.. have a nice day. bye bye
sorry.. stupid question... I kinda already figured the answer....
What question?
Oh.. when I asked about doing something... it was stupid because I figured you were busy
so.. yeah..
Are you like.. grounded or something?. Because I wouldn't think you would be... I don't know
What'd you do?. if you don't mind me asking
Umm okay?. sorry... I can leave you alone
I was..
but you didn't want it :P. sorry
well... I hate myself.. and.. I don't want to waste your time. .....                   Didn't mean to send that. ....
Doesn't matter. it's not important. I just.. feel like curling up into a ball
Umm.. maybe
I don't know
Well.. go for it. but I meant to delete it all. I accidentally hit return
yup
Mine says both
I suppose. sorry
Umm.. easy. I suppose. small words
yup
Eh.. not much to learn
Oh.. it was a project. not much of a unit
I actually.. don't think so
yeah. *sigh**. so.. how's it going?
yeah... Doesn't matter though
nah.. it's not that bad
yeah.. I know. just.. me being sad isn't that important
nah
Well it doesn't look like a slump.. so I can't take that as the honest truth
It might mean that. but it's whatever. really.... .. just need a hug... but.. not really.. ish kinda. but.. not really
Yeah? . It's fine though
I wouldn't want you to waste one on me... you should save it for someone important
Yeah.. I guess that means I'm not awesome..
not really :P. not in that context. I feel like.. I'm just going to bring you down also.. so.. I should probably go
Well.. either way...
That's just silly
Umm.. what I just said was silly?
That's.. pretty silly
ha, okay?
nice
alright.... sorry
Do you now?
Ah.. well that happens to a lot of people. I was kinda saying sorry for being.. never mind. sorry. I should just.. let you go.. and disappear like intended
Nope.. no place to be.. just need to find a place to die :P. curl up in a ball and die*. can't forget the crutial "curling up" stage in that
Yeah... exactly... Thank you for reminding me. So.. if you don't mind.. I'm going to curl up in a ball, wither and die
nope... fortunately not
me either..
Who knows..
I don't even know what you're referencing
It's no problem. 'Cause there's some extra space on you floor next to your bed and if you let me say so I'll be there. 'Cause in the night time when you're sleepin' I'll be there  to say that I loved you and I loved you anyway. :P
I don't even know. but it's nice. but doesn't help with being sad at all
I'm such a mess. so I don't even know...
I've always been a mess. but.. I don't know.. it's just been an awful week. and I still need that hug :/. But I'll live
Nah.. it's the overall week
Nah.. I'll live
I don't know. which means I'd prefer not to say. mainly because I don't know how to say it
of course... maybe. I don't know... I listened to this really depressing song.. and it made me think about stuffs
Yeah...
And you say: "I know that this will hurt, but if I don't break your heart things will just get worse.". sorry
yeah :/
I don't know..
:/ I suppose not. sorry
It's fine.. I suppose I don't need a hug. And I know you don't like them in the first place. so.. I'll live
Yeah.. but like.. just not from me...
I don't know why you shouldn't.. but don't worry. I'll do my best not to hug you
I wouldn't know why...
Well... you shouldn't.. . you probably shouldn't even like me.. because I'm not much to like
Well.. I'm not even sure that you should have met me.. because when I met you I had a day off of track and was accidentally at the bus stop at the same time. The likelihood that we would have met was low
I'm not great friends with Edwin?
Right.. well I was friends with him
But even thinking back on it.. thinking that me meeting you was a 1 in a million chance.. I can't imagine my life without you
I would say you're special... and I still don't know a lot of people at school
but I'd say I'm not special.. at all. sorry...
I don't see how
My tear filled eyes. just kidding..
I haven't gotten that sad yet
Well I have been
Remember that "journal" I kept with me?
the one before that
but like.. both at the same time
Well.. you wanted to read them several times..
and the reason I wouldn't let you was because of the stuff I wrote in it. Like.. back then I didn't know that you liked me... so I would write in the "journal" about it... which sounds very girly.. but I wrote about my entire day, taking notes and what not
Most of the time I'd write stuff like: "Wow.. I really like this girl"
Well.. I didn't want you to read it because I didn't know how you felt about the matter
I was glad of that too. like.. here I meet this girl and boom. somehow we had really close lockers
That too.. that's like.. even crazier. And believe me.. I didn't plan that
I don't want to sound corny or anything.. but with the low chances of all that happening.. it all happened, like.. maybe it was meant to?. yup.. sounded corny regardless
See.. just as I thought
But I kinda meant like.. we were at least supposed to meet each other
But as the song goes.. we're accidentally in love
which.. sounds more cheesy after what i just said..
Yeah.. sorry
But still.. I feel like you're supposed to be in my life.. . for what exactly.. who knows..
I was talking about you with a friend.. and they suggested that I call you. but I didn't know your number. and they just told me to check facebook... so... sorry. kinda.. creepy of me. And I understand if that.. changes things
Yeah.. sorry about that... I'm such a loser....
Ah, well.. I'm sorry. I went about things... poorly. Like.. I should have talked to you more.. but I was too shy and I didn't know what to say or if you'd want me there
If you say so.. . but I felt like I messed up quite frequently. And I still feel like I do
You're so.. unsupportive.. jeez. Like.. I try to put myself down.. and you don't support my claim. You just boost me up every day
because it's *quaker* oats for a reason..
Well.. a Quaker is kinda like a pilgrim in a way. I think they were separatists . "Don't play me as the fool, even though I'm just the fool for you"
if you say so.... I still feel like one..
Well.. you are really reassuring.. and you're really kind for saying all that stuff. but sometimes it's hard to believe it... But like.. it's really amazing that you think that
Ah... Well.. you're pretty unbelievable.. so I may have to listen to that. sorry. corny
Which one?
EMF?. sorry.. for not knowing what that stands for
Yeah... Or they could have been a band for 8 years . (sorry.. looked em up)
Epson Mad Funkers. Epsom*
And.. I still need to see the video.. although.. still can wait.. I think
It has you in it.. and that's what makes it amazing :D
Well it's still nice. I mean.. I liked it :D. You are the only person in this room and I can't take my eyes off you. I bet you wouldn't guess what I would do to kiss you in the middle of the room, and all this love between us grows but we're sittin' on our hands and turnin' up our nose. And I don't blame you anymore. I don't blame you.. :P. Sorry... I'll stop it with the songs. and I'll stop it with what I'm thinking about saying
Well.. I'm still sorry
Well.. if I said it then I wouldn't be thinking it
Exactly. And I wouldn't just.. tell you.. over the internet. But.. I will ask you.. is Afterprom something you'd be interested in?. It gets really late... so like.. you know
Yes. I just didn't know if you would be. but I got tickets anyway
I don't know what you mean
Is it kinda like.. the sub thing too?
well.. just don't worry about it
Got which one?
How would you feel if I said you didn't?
well.. umm.. hmmmmm. well.. the other day I found 5 dollars in my backpack. and.. well.. yeah. It's not there any more
yeah.. . I kinda distracted you.. with the whole sock monkey thing
Yeah... sorry
Well when you said "Sock Monkeys are cool". Immediately thought of you
Nope. But if I knew that.... I would have tried to find a better one to give you. I'll attempt to make one one of these days. and it'll be personally for you
I'll keep that in mind :P. Oh.. and would you believe me if I told you that I'm a robot sent here from the future?. [:|]. :|]
I was sent here.. to view human life :P. it's a science experiment. and the reason I'm so awesome is because I'm a robot
Exactly.. that's the experiment. and I'm not sure if I've succeeded yet. and I was given a specialized voice chip
I know... Who said I had one/. ?*
Well.. with that being said... I'll assume that my mission is complete. so it looks like I can go back to the future. :P
I'm not that kind of robot. Have you seen the movie Bicentennial man?
Umm.. Bicentennial Man is about a robot who seeks to be human. and after being alive for 200 years the Supreme Court finally rules him as the oldest man to live
Yeah. Oh darling, I love you so. If you ask for my heart there's no way I'll say no
Yup, is it working?. Just kidding.. it's a song.. but I found it to be really cute. and it.. says things perfectly
Well.. I'm just programmed that way
Aw? Why?
Well.. you just need to see Bicentennial Man. But.. I suppose you're right.. I can't love. just kidding of course... I'd say I really do 
He does. It's really.. cute ish
is that a bad aww?. Because if it is.. I'm sorry
oh, yeah. Well it's amazing. As are you. sorry
Nah. But.. thank you *(:. (: *
sorry
Oh yeah.. are you going to it?
Aw :/. okay... Well.. that's a bummer. I suppose I'll see you some other time then
I don't know.. you won't be there.. I may just have a different mindset
I couldn't ask that of you
They have before :P
Yeah. like.. yeah. :P. Like.. it's team support. n' all. But still.. I couldn't ask that of you. I mean.. it would take your entire saturday away from you. a saturday that you could do important stuff n' all
Cosmos was today. I.. don't know what you're saying
Oh, really?. That's crazy. I was unaware of that. Wait.. so are you going to cosmos?
Cosmos is in Salem though
I'll be all the way in Lynchburg
Yeah.. sorry about that
go for it. it's on your wall. and I still can't be responsible in taking away your saturday
Are you just saying that it's good sounding?. I thought you couldn't hear . Wait. Lexington. I get the two confused. Which.. looks further away
Ah.. well. Yeah.. it's a little far away. and.. not worth it at all
If you did.. you'd do something dumb like.. go all the way to Lexington to see just another guy
We must be talking about two different Peters then... Because I'm talking about myself :P
Yeah.. totally different. because I'm not awesome 
you must have the last names confused
see. we don't even have the same middle name
haha. well... You seem too good to me. I don't want to know what life would be.. if you wanted to go. sorry.. for.. . yeah. :P. Bye bye
You would want to?
I'm saying I don't want to know what life is without you
:'(
:/. Well... I still like you though. so.. I feel like I may appear awesome on my own. but without you I just won't be the same. Because I don't want to go to a place without your heart
Oh.. well
There are plenty fish in the sea.. and we could float if you wanted
And you seem too good to me
It's a song.. but coincidentally it says exactly what I want to say. sorry. I should be more creative
Yeah :/. I suppose so. Well.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:. And the song I was quoting is Better than Better Could Ever Be. Which.. is like.. you :D
Thank you
good luck to you too. Well.. I'd be lying if I said I was
n't*. sorry.. that was crutial
Yeah. You made things a lot better, a while ago
Well.. you gave me a reason to smile. and you gave me hope
Thank you for being you
Because I'm just so smile deprived normally?. But.. yeah.. thanks for being you, because if you were a different person.. I wouldn't feel what I feel in my heart the way I do
My smile isn't that grand
haha
Maybe that's how vague it could be too :P. I don't like my smile
Me too?. But I'm sorry if that was vague to begin with. (And I just don't like it)
I was just saying.. that.. I don't know. It's you and no one else. if.. that makes sense. (and it's not weird..)
Exactly.. and I like you and not someone else.. it's just you (:. Like.. my heart's fixed on you. (and.. I don't think so.. it's kinda lame.. n' stuff)
Yeah, you too. Goodnight and sweet dreams. And.. you're amazing *:. (: *
haha.. sure.. blame it on that :P. Goodnight (:. Have a good day tomorrow. In fact.. a great day because I won't be there :P. Bad day for me :/. Any who.. bye bye. and have like.. amazing dreams n' all that :D. sorry. bye. I hope your meet went well.. and that your overall day was fantastic :D I'm kind of dead right now.. so.. I may be typing stuff that doesn't even make sense.. but like.. goodnight and sweet dreams n' all (:
Well.. the sleep helped a little.. but I still feel like a zombie.. and yeah.. have an enjoyable Mothers Day with your mom n' stuff :P You're even cooler (:. Oh.. and you may just have to wait to tell me "stuff". Yeah, hope your day was amazing.. and I hope I feel better :P G'night n' sweet dreams :D
Yeah.. totally.. zombie state :P and I know how it feels to kill a lightbulb... Hi
Oh.. well.. okay
Umm.. okay. haha :/ bye. :P. I'm.. doing alright... ish :/ I hope you're doing well :D But have fun with the spanish n' stuff and if I don't get the opportunity.. then talk to you tomorrow, goodnight, and sweet dreams (:
Oh.. hey
I missed your video :/. Beat me to what?
I.. wasn't. So that's weird. I was actually like.. about to go in all honesty. But I'll stay now.. if you wanted..
you'd be surprised how slowly I'm typing :P. as to how*
Still zombie state :P. I still wish I could have seen that video 
I had commentary?. Because I feel like that would make the video worse
Pshh.. I bet it was so boring.. and informative. And I mean that in a good way. :D
I would have not stayed home just to see it. But I forgot.. so it looks like I missed out :/
I don't know.. I wouldn't have wanted to see you. purely because . like.. getting you sick. would be lame
Well.. exactly.. I have a cough. so it'd be bad
I don't think it'd be worth it. Seeing me even when I'm healthy isn't worth it :P
You sure that it's worth it when I'm my worst though?. at my*. Oh.. this is random.. but I watched Up today :P
It made me cry
I have. but.. it made me cry again
I cried then.. and at some point in the middle. I forgot where.. because I was "dead". and I was zoning out and falling asleep n' stuff
Nah.. . I haven't yawned surprisingly. But it's just.. really really sad in the beginning
and I was anticipating it. so that didn't help
Yeah :'(
Yeah. They were all happy. and then.. it was just sad. and it was sad when he mentioned her. because like.. he really loved her . Oh.. I remember. I cried again when he was looking at the photo album
haha. I'll have to check it out. But I think it was mostly because of Up and how it was.. I don't know. anyway... I don't want to be wasting your time or whatever
Yeah, it was just that one part
And it's not fine.. if you've got stuff to do.. then you should do it. and like.. not waste your time with me
I can barely smell any thing
But I bet it smells amazing. and nah.. just.. I can breathe. I can't think though :P. But like.. I can't smell at the moment. Weird.. I suppose :P
I don't know... Not sure if I can smell anything. Sure I'm not just wasting your time?
So you have to go?. Because I can't tell if that was rhetorical. Essentially I'm brain dead right now :P. I'm also super dizzy and everything is blue o.O
It's fine. I just.. . I'm not on the top of my game. so.. I'm easily confused :P 
haha. Totally what I meant
haha. You could be sitting on the unfolded board. but then again.. you could be sitting on some of the pieces in the end
Me too
so unfortunate :P. But I suppose Rebecca Black would have a seat to take
:P. Is it bad that I barely remember what happened to me today?
maybe?
I haven't a clue as to what that is
Umm.. that's.. crazy. I hope your okay. I hear crocodiles are dangerous. you're*
I read that as escapade. Because I'm dumb :P
that couldn't be it
Yeah.. I should stop bothering you. so perfect timing :P
I like how you can agree . Anyway.. can fun. have*. see.. I'm so stupid... Yeah.. have fun, bye. I'm going to go curl up in a ball soon :P
I'll do my best. not to. *. Wow.. I'm such a failure. I hate.. life :P. any who.. have fun and write some 'mazin' stuff. bye bye :D
haha. that'd be so silly
haha. well.. thanks for caring n' talk to you some other time
Oh.. I'm so dead... bye. You're amazing (:. ... sorry.. i'm going to go die again :P
Psh.. why not?
Okay. bye
I am aware. it's pretty cool. sorry..
Oh well. Don't let me keep you from that
Well.. that's perfect because I'm just "something to do". :P
Oh I meant that in the best of ways. :P
For what?
I don't know what I was referring to :P. sorry
Can't say it reminds me of the same
They remind me why I'm alive. just kidding :P
Well.. I don't know what keeps me alive . .... sorry. I sound a bit morbid don't I?
Or.. it sounds bad either way
Ah. Well.. I suppose I'm thinking in the wrong context. And maybe I have something to live for.. but I feel judged whenever I say it
haha.. if only you knew :P
Umm maybe?. Do you think you know?
Well maybe you should tell me what you know?
Hmm.. not... hmmm. okay. Nice observation :D
Well.. that's why you live it, huh?
Well.. to figure stuff out. you know?
Yeah.. see.. I was going for the cliche approach...
which I realize now.. would have been a bad idea :P
yeah.. thanks.. umm. are you sure I'm not just wasting your time?
nothing..
ummm.. oh I said nothing just because... it's really something. just nothing important/nothing you need to know
Well.. cliche approach.. what comes to mind when I say that?
Yeah. that
Well.. close. sorry. "Live life for the ones you love"
I wouldn't think so
Well.. I feel like.. I shouldn't talk because I'll just say something lame. so I'll just be like "Oh, haha.. yeah"
Most likely. But like.. it's from the heart and mind.. but the stuff my heart says is stuff you should already know . and I don't just want to repeat myself
Haven't heard that. but sounds nice. I would say "I'd like to be lonely with you" but being with you could never be lonely. sorry...
Haha. alright :P
Editing this video.. just reminded me. that I still want to see yours. no matter how bad you may say it is
Oh.. just re-editing something
Oh.. people complain about the synchronization of that Joker video I did. So.. I'm just putting it together again
Yeah.. well.. others did. So.. Just redoing it. not sure if I'll actually upload it though
Haha, I suppose. Would it be bad.. to be gone again? Do you think any one would miss me?
I doubt people missed me today.... Sounds very unlikely
It's silly for you to miss me.. it'd be weird for the team to miss me and I don't talk to my classmates.. so they wouldn't care :P
Nah.. I'm not important enough. Nah. that's more absurd . It's kinda like "Oh.. hey.. Peter's not here". and then they just forget about it
I wouldn't think the same . Or at least.. people shouldn't miss me if they do
I suppose. But I shouldn't be on peoples minds.. I just take up space
... just saying. I'm not important.. and there's no need to think about me.. ever
I am. I'm not worth any ones time
especially not yours
Not really
I'm not certain.. but why would you want to waste your time talking to me? I mean.. I'm just another guy you see. I don't think there's anything that sets me off as different. Except.. I'm a loser... With that being said.. I should just.. leave you alone. You probably have like.. some work to do.. or a tv show to watch
Yeah.. second isn't real sounding at all
I don't know.. I'm just a waste of space
The wall would give you a better conversation
I.. can't say I get it. ah. Got it. Well.. I'm just an idiot
umm.. I'd say.. it-oid
I don't know what it means. I'm afriad to say. Which proves my point even further
Doubtful
I honestly don't know. I don't know what makes me cool, or amazing.. or good at anything. To be honest.. I feel pretty worthless
I don't know if it's just because I'm sick
Who knows... All I know is I don't know how I am classified in that. And.. I don't know why anyone could like me... Or love me for that matter... I'm just a random person. Who should just be shunned 
Well.. if there's someone for everyone.. then I should wait for everyone else. And the someone for you should be perfect and amazing.. . Sorry..
I mean.. umm. Someone for everyone... you know?. And your someone has to be amazing.. unlike me
I don't know what I'm saying..
Well.. I don't think I deserve you
Well.. that person wouldn't be nearly as awesome as you. sorry
I'm saying you're the "awesomest person ever"
So.. are you saying that your awesomeness matches with mine?
And that.. we'd be amazing together?
Wait.. what?. Okay.. so teacher.. yeah you should be working on it.. it's more important than me any way. and I'm lost after that
It's near the end of the year. I doubt that she would. But trying would be good. And sorry for being "cliche" and lame before
Oh.. saying that we'd be amazing together :P
So.. the ish means that you agree :D. sorry... umm, you're cooler (:
Oh.. probably not.. I wish though. And.. you're way more amazingly cool
Yeah, I was about to say (:
Are you just randomly rawring at me?. Or is this "Dino-speak"?. :P
Mostly to what?. But I gotcha. maybe.. you should be more focused on it?
But.. umm. never mind
Ah.. okay. That's what I was asking :P. I've slept all day. :P
Yeah
The only reason I woke up the times I did was because the movie went to the credits. I somehow fell asleep to explosions :P. And then Gap called me
Oh.. he apparently called me once before. But I was asleep and didn't get the phone. then the second time he called to ask where I've been
He also explained as to why he called the first time
I don't know.. someone wanted to talk to me. But it looks like they never got their chance
Umm.. no
Oh?
Well.. he said he called just so that someone other than him could talk
oh.. yeah. of course. I kinda know who.. but you're acting so oblivious that I don't know any more. sorry
Well.. hmmm. He told me it was you :P
Yeah.. . I guess he was joking. But I'm pretty sure he wouldn't call normally :P
Basically
I guess. Oh well. haha. It would've been silly to want to talk to me any way
I suppose I'll never know why he called the first time :P
Oh.. well. That's silly. Even if it is just to write a letter
if you say so. But why would you want to see me?
Not at all
Why?
Was I talking about that?. And.. I mean.. I'd like to see you too (:. But I'm like.. not healthy.. I sound awful/look awful and I feel like there's a better use of your time
Yeah.. you made the analogy sad :/. but I still don't know why :P
maybe :P. Nonetheless.. I'd be up for it :P. but still
A little bit. oh wait what?
Oh.. the seeing you thing. Up for it.. 100%
Well.. yeah. Whole milk isn't even close
Yeah.. it'd be like drinking from the utter
Nah. It means they have to clean it and pastuerize n' stuff. Make it so you won't get sick. and eventually you get 2%
nah.. 2% milk I guess. I don't know. there's a process to it
maybe.. that's it. I don't know though. I'm stupid :P
haha.. alright. Well.. when were you planning on writing that letter?. :P
I mean.. I'm okay. I wouldn't say I'm the best. but if you needed me.. I could always try to help. If I'm like.. better :P
I am.. kinda. out of it completely. and if you are. then.. maybe you should go to bed
He'd be used to it
Maybe, haha
How so?
Cuddliness?. jk
haha, really?
Well.. I'd be fine with being cuddly (:. And why can't you wait?
Oh, well that's awesome :D. And I'd be honored to be like Winnie the Pooh :P
:/. :P
Isn't it Forest?
Haha. just so that his bad spelling would be excusable . :P
haha. yeah. too bad
what brings that up?
Are you saying I'm silly?. oh... Oh. well... I see how it is
haha?. Thanks?
When has silly ever been good?. Like.. Do I act silly? Or make you feel silly?
Oh.. makes sense. I was.. watching this scary video. I kinda.. need a hug now
Yeah.. I jumped out of my seat. My mom went to bed :/
So I'm stuck
No.. it was just scary
haha. I'd like to see that
Yeah. It.. was scary. Gap put it up on facebook. but don't watch it. I watched it in intervals
Please don't. I screamed so loud
it's not pretty
(:. Thanks?. You're prettier. sorry
Aren't you talking to me now?
Isn't it a little late?. :P
Well.. if only
I.. don't know about the "you know". Like.. exactly. I have an idea
ah. well.. I'm patient. I may have used the wrong word. but.. I don't care :P
I can't hear anything over my heart pounding. But yeah.. I can wait.. and you can tell me whenever :P
Yes. I need a hug... but no ones awake. and noises are happenin'
The room I'm next to is pitch black
I'm no where near anything that will help :'(
I kinda don't want to leave where I am. I'm scared
I wouldn't want you to stay just for that
But like.. sleep should be important. I mean.. is important. so.. you should like.. sleep
Well.. keeping you awake isn't good
I like you too (:. But I still wouldn't want to keep you awake when you didn't have to be
Well don't worry. We'll have plenty of time
so yeah.. you should get some sleep (:
Is that a question?
I suppose?
I can't say that I do
yeah, basically :P
haha.. I'd ask why. but I'm afraid :P
Possibly. I don't know
Anyway.. you should get some sleep. And I'll do my best to be unafraid of the dark
so.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I'll try. I'm still terrifid
terrified*
And you're very real too . :P. And yeah.. great talking to you :D
Thank you. haha, it's fine :D. Bye. And I hope to see you tomorrow
Haha.. it's very cute. bye. If I were to get a dog.. it'd be that one
haha. Thanks again. bye. G'night 
No doubt. Good morning too. forgot about that. :P
Happens to the best of us. like.. with me it was scary stories/ghost videos
No.. just can't stop. :P
I just got curious. like.. I watched some that weren't scary. but out of no where. one scared me to death
Well.. yeah. Anyway.. if I am ever so lucky.. then I will see you tomorrow.. if not.. then goodnight (morning) and sweet dreams. See you whenever I get the chance (:
Who knows? There could be one right next to you
Yeah :D. Hilary Duff was in one of em too :P. And.. sorry for proposing that there could be a ghost near you. At the very least it's a spider. Bye even more awesome person (:
Oh.. it's fine. Talking to you is always nice. See you.. whenever I see you :D
Hello there
I've been doing alright
but I somehow missed you the entire day. I suppose you could call it poor timing or something. But yeah.. how have you been doing?
I meant like.. I missed you in the hallway. :P. But.. sounds scary
Ah.. well I'm sorry you were excited
Well.. I slept mostly today :P. Didn't wake up until 1 :P. But.. I'm feeling a little better 
I can't remember any of my dreams. But I was so scared last night. I was holding on to dear life to this stuffed animal I found :P. Yeah.. pretty lame, I know 
I suppose it did a little 
Weird. I hope I didn't give Gap nightmares. I sent him the scary videos :P
Well I wouldn't think that it would have affected him the entire time..
I don't know :P. maybe
Ah, well bye then. You too
Oh, it's fine. and sounds like a lot of fun. So.. I'll talk to you whenever I get the chance :P bye bye
haha, sounds sweet. later. Hey, hope I'm not.. interrupting anything. If so.. I can leave.. n' yeah :P
"nah, it's fine" you sure?
I mean.. you sure?. You could be doing something super important
That depends on the color of the dress that you may have for that random thingy. :P. I'm thinking.. red?
haha, sweet :P. Sounds exciting :D
Yeah, that exciting! :P
I think that's when someone is so excited that rainbows start shooting from their stomachs 
I feel like the expression on her face would have been a little less happy
I wouldn't.. it's happened to me before. it's a lot less fun than it sounds
Rainbows don't like it when people are upset.. . so they'll attack you until you're happy again. That's why I stay indoors mostly
Oh.. I keep blinds down at all times. Because I know the rainbows will be able to see me upset
Not real rainbows. Real ones are only formed outside. I stay away from sprinklers too... because miniature ones can be formed then
Any light at all works. because the water refracts the light into the full color spectrum
And Vampires can't enter a house without permission
I don't think he did.. but if so.. I knew that prior
See.. you're just risky with that sort of stuff. And I do not
I have a mat.. but it doesn't welcome people
Imagine a person named Matt.. and that was his job :P
I could imagine that being a short film :P
ummm.. okay?. Bye...
Way to make me feel like an idiot and just leave.... anyway.. bye
I haven't a clue now.. 
It's fine... I suppose I'll talk to you later though
Well.. I suppose it wasn't too important. Because I do not remember what it was. or if I was typing anyway
If I can beat it?. I have no idea what your saying... not going to lie :P. Umm.. yeah. bye...
Ah. gotcha. It's fine. I honestly don't think I was typing something.. and if I was.. I doubt it was important
Ah, gotcha :P. I think the stuff you say is pretty important. usually :P
Maybe.. anyway.. I'll let you get to your important stuff
Well.. whatever you have to do
Either way.. whatever you gotta do.. 
Haha.. well you said you had to go.. . so.. bye :P
Ah. I've done that before
All the time
I usually don't want to awkwardly interrupt a conversation.. so I kinda avoid getting into the conversation all together. and I do so many stupid/embarrassing things.. that now I just don't even care
Yeah.. usually. But.. whenever I interrupt a conversation one party of the conversation tends to leave
Nah. Not is. it*. I feel like I should just stop talking to people. You know.. that way I wouldn't be such a bother. and I wouldn't interrupt things
It sounds like a great idea if you ask me. The only better idea would be if I just disappeared
Yup
Sorry.. Yes, I honestly believe it. Better?
Yours wasn't an answer
Response works
It happens to the best of us
Valid point.. but talking to me isn't necessary because there are so many others to talk to. And I'm not going to lie.. I feel like at this moment, I'm bothering you.. so to prevent myself from furthering that.. I think I should go
See.. I just feel like when I put myself down... it annoys you. so.. if I just stopped talking to you, then I couldn't annoy you. problem solved
I am sorry.. 
Yeah... But still.. I'm sorry...
alright
Oh, it's fine. And at a perfect time :P 
Just kidding. It's hard to think that, but thank you
Feeling.. sick and cooped up in my house..
Yeah... I'm probably acting the way I am purely because of that :P. Oh.. I just watched this weird.. but cute video. It's of this kids first kiss. And he's like.. 6 or something
Well like.. it's so cute.. that it's disturbing :P
I haven't seen that. But like.. I accidently found this video called "High Five for First Kiss". And the kid was like "Why did you kiss me?"
Okay.. lemme 'splain. No, there is too much. Lemme sum it up for you. So the girl kisses him on the cheek. And he asks "Why did you kiss me?". "Because I like you" and she gives him a big hug. And then she kisses him on the lips, and he wipes his mouth. But then starts cheering. I thought it was funny purely because of the way he acted :P
Oh.. I was quoting a movie you most likely haven't seen
Princess Bride?
haha. Impressive
I saw it in theatres
I liked that movie :D
Well.. the hero gets the girl. that's how it always ends
Very silly
And that's why that movie was sad
It's pretty good
You should. It would be a good use of your time
Last time I had one of those "cravings" things went poorly
Umm.. no. Just.. sugar rush. then nightmares. :P
Sugar before bed is said to give you nightmares
It's crazy what it does to your brain
Haha... I feel like any dream containing me... would be terrifying. See the rhyme I did there?. :P. But yeah.. that dream seems kind of silly to me. I've had some pretty terrifying ones
Yeah, and it's even better because it's true :D
Oh.. I said any dream containing me would be terrifying.. :P. But mine.. consists of ghosts/zombies and serial killers. The usual
No, haha. Parachute pants are just really really baggy pants
I kinda like those dreams where you free fall. And landing. that's kind of nice. A lot of my nightmares end up with me dying.. . it's only a nightmare because in the end I don't really die 
Well.. I usually get shot or something
And I sort of get a burning sensation in the place I got shot or stabbed
Or I tingle.. for a long time
haha
I fell asleep in the car once. And I had a dream where I was balancing on a ball.. and I fell off. So my foot spazzed out and I slapped myself in the face
I have no idea. but slapping myself kinda hurt. :P. *sigh** I don't like being home... Like.. being home tomorrow.. won't be fun
People have had so much fun without me... can't spoil it now
And you had a backflip incident?
ah.. makes sense. Hmm.. real reason?. I don't know. Why does it matter?
Good point... What happens if I exceed it?
Well.. I doubt many people will miss me that much if I miss just one more day
I'm sorry that you miss me honey, bunches. (of oats). :P
Well.. I suppose we'll see. Just don't be too disappointed if I'm not there. Actually.. try not to be disappointed at all
Oh.. it's.. going as usual :P
the same :P
Oh.. yeah.. same ol' same ol'
Well if it's the same as it started.. then why else would I be home if it weren't bad?
Well.. not bad bad.. but bad enough to stay home. But I'm not dying or anything :P
It was probably you. I mean.. all those days.. you coughing n' such. just kidding.. I'm not blaming you :P
Don't be sorry.. it's fine
Well.. you can only hope. We'll have to wait and see
Well.. it could happen
But if it doesn't.. . you know.. :P
Well.. hopefully
It's happened before
Well when I got strep one time :P. And when I got chicken pox
Tonsils n' all that jazz
I do have them still.. do you?. But you could have gotten the vaccination for chicken pox
Oh.. cool :D
Whoa.. me too :P
I got the chicken pox because of the vaccine
The vaccine is to prevent it
yeah.. but I had the worst case my doctor has ever seen
Maybe. It was pretty bad.. and I have scars from it. But it's all over now :P
It was 5th grade. good times. Oh.. and.. 7 with 10 being worst
then.. a 4.. maybe?
Oh, it's cool. I got 2 letters from colleges :P. Which is weird. I thought they stopped
I know
Good idea
I've gotten a few from ones I've heard of. Like Pratt
Weird. :P
Oh just.. reading the letters I got. Skimming actually :P
I didn't apply. they're just telling me why I should go to the school
Well I'm not yet a senior. so... I don't know what good it would do
haha, totally
Random smiley. Awesome
Oh? not so random?. What?
Very good. And good for you to mention it. And I like how it fits.. with your heart :P
You just have to keep opening up old wounds, don't you?
It's fine. I'm only kidding
I think so.. with you, right?
Hmm.. I suppose, it may sound bad.. but I haven't given it much though
Well.. umm.. after-afterprom plans?. Like.. that would be 4 in the morning :P
Well.. I haven't yet made plans.. is there anything you'd like to do?
Well both of those sound nice
Well.. someone did ask me if I was up for dinner before.. . But I'm sorry.. I suppose I forgot to think of those important details. unfortunately
Who is "that person". ?*
Ah.. well. I would, of course, be up for anything
I don't know
Still no clue... I just don't want to be insensitive either.. you know 
Just gotta do everything in one night?
Haha, well.. I can't wait
Just thinking that I'll be spending time with you is pretty exciting
I should've planned sooner :P. Just so I would know how to get everything in order :P. sorry. I really should have thought about this 
Oh well.. I'm fine with whatever. And I really wasn't thinking about what to do.. with those friends of mine :P
I think so, why?
haha.. . I don't think he was going to ask anyone. I think he's just going
crazy
Very. Anyway.. I don't know if it's just me.. but it's kinda late
.. it may look a little doubtful. but who knows. Bye. goodnight and sweet dreams
Bye (:. oh, you too.. with the amazing day thing :P
Nervous for what?. sorry..
Yeah.. so great.. (sarcasm) I'm soaked.. but I suppose it was worth it :P. Oh and.. sorry about stuffs.. also, if I don't get a chance to talk to you later.. I suppose goodnight, sweet dreams n' all that jazz :P
I meant.. hmm.. I liked watching the lightning.. it was pretty cool.. but getting soaked wasn't the best..  Yeah.. talk to you tomorrow.. and sorry, still :P. I liked that random typing.. and then.. going offline, pretty nice XD
Probably better wutg friends.. but it was nice anyway..  Sorry? well it's fine... :P And I bet it's amazing regardless :D See you tomorrow, good night (morning) and sweet dreams. have no idea how I made "with" into wutg.. but that's my fail for the day...
Oh and.. I may have just called.. but just to inform you that the bus does indeed leave at 8:15am, however, you can be there no later than 11:15am. So if you wanted to show up late, you always could (if you were given a ride there) and that way you could sleep in a little.. plus you wouldn't be stuck on a busride.. so that would be nice I suppose :D
I was just passing along the information I acquired from my father.. which was wrong as you can tell... I'm really sorry for wasting your day (among other things).. I know that you could have done something better with it. Whatever that is left of it.. I hope it's fantastic. Anyway, have a good night n' all.. sorry again. Hello there (:
It's fine. Thank you?. You're even cooler
I bet it'll be great either way . I mean, I've never made a cheesecake before.. so I guarantee that yours is better than one I could make
Well.. I doubt that. I feel like yours is just spectacular. :D
As you should. Just pounce on it
Well.. that's just essential. Just.. try not to hurt yourself in the process. I've been so bored today.. when I should have baked a cheesecake.. I bet it's very entertaining (:
I am bored ;P. :P *
Pretty open to it. but I'm not sure if my parents would approve. But.. I'm sure I can somehow solve my boredom. whereas you have more important things to do. The cheesecake is calling >:O. I'll just talk to you later. Maybe :P
I would be too
haha, I love cheesecake :P
I'll try to..
Have fun with that. buh bye. Have a good rest of your day n' all
I know.. . I could like... not go outside.. because I have nothing to do :P. Anyway, have fun :D
Bye. Hey, not too sure if this is too important.. but I saw this really shiny doorknob.. it was pretty breath taking :P Anyway.. just.. though I needed to tell someone about that, have a good rest of your day and a good night (:
Well, thanks for listening and everything; it was really nice of you. I really care about you too and you're amazing (: Thanks again (sorry for the whole.. tear business) :P But yeah, I hope today is going well for you and I hope you get some nice sleep in the mix of your plans :D. Oh, good luck on your SOL tomorrow! I bet you'll do great :D Anyway, good night n' sweet dreams (:
I don't know.. I feel like listening to me would get boring after a while.. :/ sorry... have a good day and all
I know, so were you
that would explain things :P
Yeah
Yeah, that happened too. Too bad you couldn't keep that up . If you say so.. sorry.... sorry. I'm sorry that you had to see that.. it's just.. my usual route was flooded.. 
Yeah.. so to prevent myself from drowning.. or getting my feet wet. Either way.. I had to go around. so.. unfortunately you had to see me
Really now?
Well I can understand. it's not the greatest idea. But I thought it was kinda nice. so.. yeah.. sorry. Where you like.. questioning: "Why is he so stupid?". Were*. Wow.. I just failed.. :/
Maybe I was.. but who cares?. And it was nice in the rain. it wasn't too cold. and I had doughnuts at my house.. so that's partly the reason I didn't want to take it
Might've been.. partly because of that. Hmm.. well William was like.. you should walk home! So I was like: okay... He was kidding of course.. but I did it any way. but I sort of planned on it any way.. because I didn't want to bother you in any way
Well.. I still feel like it.. because people keep saying it. I don't care if they were joking.. it's still bothersome. And I didn't want to interrupt your conversations.. with other people. so I just left.... Because I felt like they were more important
Well.. people were calling me a jerk today. And I mean.. the entire day you seemed busy with conversations.. so I didn't want to impose or bother you whilst that
Well.. okay. Just.. still, I didn't want to interrupt anything. Because I'm not important enough 
Well.. I was at my locker around that time... and I didn't want to interrupt then either. Well like.. who am I to take up your time?. Sorry..
Anyone? Because I'm not that special. -sorry to argue
I suppose so. But I still don't see how I fit all that much. sorry again... I should stop arguing
Like.. I know that you're only trying to help and that you care.. and all I'm doing is dismissing it all
Don't worry I know. It's just hard to believe sometimes. I mean, I don't deserve your time. But somehow.. . :P. sorry....
Yes. It's unbelievable how it works that way
(: I like you too 
Well.. that would have been nice.. but I'll pretend you didn't. and I'm sure. I've never been
Not even then
Crazy. Sounds like my kind of place though. I think my brother has been. Back when he went to New York
I should go to Richmond some time . Well.. maybe not. it's kinda silly to just go for Cheesecake
I feel like cheesecake can be cheesecake
and I've had that frozen cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory. so.. you know.. I feel like I've experienced it :P
Yeah :P. And you're pretty amazing. And I bet your cheesecake is better than any I could ever buy
but I kinda doubt it :P. Well.. Maybe I'll find out
What's the worst that could happen?. Food poisoning?. Please :P
Well. no.. not really. It's actually not pleasant at all. But I bet it'd be worth it
Oh well.. it's just a bunch of vomiting... From personal experience..
Yeah
But with 7up it's all natural?
Hmm.. that's an interesting question. i honestly don't know
Oh.. umm.. maybe. umm.. Before you go. Quick question. wristlet or corsage?
Any color preference?
Haha, well. thank you. I needed to know that :D. And.. I suppose you'll just have to go to bed wondering whether I am sad or not :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams . (:
It's not important
Well.. let's go with happy :D. So.. goodnight. See you tomorrow. maybe
Alright, sweet dreams (:
Buh bye
Random smiley. (:
Neat. And I like them too. especially from you :P
Goodnight and sweet dreams. See you when the sunlight beams. sorry :P
haha, awesome (:. We sure make up a great team :P. Okay.. I'll stop.... bye bye :D
Psh.. no way. I don't even think I belong to a league... :P. Sorry.. but you're super amazing and there's no possible way you could be out of my league if not above it. bye
nah.. :P . Bye though :D. I'm.. so sorry :/ I feel really bad now and I understand if you think I'm a jerk.. you'll just be another name on the list :/
You didn't make it worse.. I did.. because I'm an awful person.. I don't deserve anything to make me happier... I feel like everyone would be better off if I just dug a hole and stayed in it. :/ Have fun with that though And I'm still sorry.........
Nonetheless.. everything I did.. was wrong.. at least in my head... so yeah.. and it was kinda nice of you to invade my personal space?  -still sorry.. and it's fine. Hello there
Alright?
Yes?
I feel like that could work. Well it's fine.. it's just.. I could have gotten a ride, but I chose to walk.. so getting a ride from you made me feel bad because you didn't have to... and it was alright for you to be clingy/pushy.. I just didn't want you to get in trouble and I didn't want to impose
alright.. I'll find out as soon as possible. but you wouldn't have to worry about taking me there
Ah, alright. I was just saying. That you know.. I'm pretty much covered :P
Oh.. in.. transportation..... anyway.. I suppose I shouldn't keep you any longer
I will let you know, don't worry. And don't worry.. I'm impartial
Bye. You're cooler
Darn.. bye
Hi
How are you?
Well.. that can't be too bad, right?. And.. if that is the case. then maybe I should just wish you farewell and goodnight
Shucks.. :P. Well.. goodnight and sweet dreams
good/bad aw?. Well.. it was nice talking to you.. I wasn't as much sad, as I was trying not to bother you like I think I do.. what made me sad was seeing you leave.. because you looked upset... and I felt as if I shouldn't have let you go without a smile, but when I got back to you.. I didn't think you wanted me around, so I left again. sorry.. . I'll just let you go n' all. bye
Why sad?
Oh.. I thought it was something else. I got kinda worried. And I wish I could talk to you more, but if you have to get up earlier. I wouldn't want you to sleepwalk around the school. No harm in wasting my time.. but I really feel like I was wasting yours.. I assume I'm who got you "flustered" so I'm sorry for that
Unless I somehow miss you like I've been tending to do. But thank you. I've never been to districts, it's going to be a new feeling
Will do. Have a good nights rest n' all. Wish I could talk to you more. oh well.. as long as the world doesn't end Saturday. :P. Anyway.. goodnight. talk to you tomorrow if I'm lucky
Well.. sometimes I never get the chance. And have you heard?. Some guy said the world will end May 21, 2011
haha
I was about to say that. We just have to make that the best day of our lives. :D
Yup
It's not. Well.. kinda :P. I don't know
I won't get to bed. but goodnight to you (:. And sweet dreams too
Or.. sleep later. And get work done now. :P. But yeah, see you tomorrow hopefully :D
Homework :P. Bye :D
haha :P. Crazy, I know. sorry... Sweet dreams
Umm, alright.. didn't know we were on the first bus, but okay
Oh it's fine, it's just a good thing I told you now than later I hope your day was all good n' stuff :D Goodnight, sweet dreams, and see you in the morning (:
It's fantastic, plus.. don't have to see me for a whole 2 hours.. I mean.. before you would have had to do that
Haha, good point (: I can't wait :D. I know that you're probably tired of me by now and that you've seen me for a long continuous amount of time.. but I'd just like to say goodnight, sweet dreams, and see you tomorrow (unless I demonstrate my avoiding skills on you)
Kinda failed at it.. sorry... kind of a thankful sorry if that works? :P Anyway, good luck on the fried ice-cream and that project and whatever else you need to do :D Oh, you missed out on Klondike bars today, that's kinda unfortunate, but you're having ice cream anyway.. so ya know :D Sorry :P talk to you later or something. Hello
How are you?
Well.. if you need to go.. you know. You've probably talked to me enough anyway. That's awesome... I was kinda alone because Gap and Drew weren't there and my parents were busy, so for the first time in a long time when I actually wanted a ride.. I had to walk home. Not my lucky day :/
Well.. no... I told them. They're upset about how late I was out
No.. it's my fault. And I deserve my punishment
No.. it's all my fault, really. Because even though they "knew" I suppose that didn't matter
I'm completely the one to blame. So don't feel bad 
I feel like your mom might be upset at me too.. . But no.. It was my fault. so don't take the blame. or feel bad
not really. If you don't see me tomorrow.. then you'll know
Oh.. just that whole avoiding you thing. might try it out. Because I don't want to get you in any trouble. and I don't want to make you upset, or annoyed with me
Well.. I'm sorry. I hope you're not in trouble. But maybe it would be better if I disappeared?. Because I seem to lead people into trouble
Well if I read lips as well as I do... Then I don't know. Pretty sure you said "Enough of you" before I left on the bus
I didn't say anything. I just asked "what?". because I was unsure as to what you were "saying"
Totally. But in all honesty. if you said what I think you said. then I love you too
I'm sorry . but (:. I wish I had the chance to actually tell you back at school
Me too. You said it a good amount last morning though
I suppose so. You probably thought that I was just a dream. And who knows.. maybe I was
I wish you could know. sorry
For talking to you too much?
and cuddly :P. sorry
possibly. but I can pretend that you didn't
oh.. maybe it was "comfy"
Well.. I can forget about it. Not too important, eh?. Plus it's not even that true
Well.. you'll just have to make do. I'm not sure I'd be allowed to go over all the time
I mean.. It's understandable. you were pretty sleepy. But.. I would be there for you
If a stuffed animal ever isn't good enough :
I don't know what you're thanking me for. But it was awesome (:
Oh.. . Well if I disappeared then it would've just all been a dream. and I was half asleep too. and possibly asleep at one point. and some of the things you said were funny. No, everyone with driving abilities were busy.. so I had to venture home alone. It was okay though, I kept myself company :P
"tolerated you otherwise"? I don't need to tolerate you because I care about you regardless. And that was pretty funny. there were other things, that you might not want to be reminded of
Stuff about dancing.. and kissing. random stuff like that
Maybe it's telling me things that you wouldn't normally tell me?. Or maybe it's not all that important/true. Who knows? :P. sorry.. maybe I should go or something. Don't know whether it was the sugar coma or that you got tired of talking to me (I'm going with the latter of the two) but.. I suppose goodnight and sweet dreams.. maybe we can continue to talk later, or not.... Okay.. so this probably isn't important at all.. but Hellogoodbye is going to be on Disaster Date.. I got that in my news feed, so I thought I'd let you know :P anyway.. I'm going to assume that you're watching Glee right now, so have fun with that (I hope I'm not wrong :P) and I hope you had a good day and will continue to. If I don't get the chance, then goodnight and sweet dreams. Correction, they were on Disaster Date :P
It's pretty darn silly, but thank you (: I think the same about you.. and.. I just killed a bug :/ sorry.. random, but you're so much cooler than I am!  Have a great night and some sweet dreams [that are as sweet as you (:] sorry :P It's.. probably bad to say that I just got home.. like.. now.. but don't worry about that. Oh, I didn't kill the bug!! :D I saved it (: Sorry.. it may not be important to you.. but I feel like most things deserve to live [even spiders, no matter how much they scare you] I'm still sad that I killed the one that was at your house :/ Anyway.. "I'm so glad that I light up in your eyes" and you're perfect And I never thanked you for walking with me and keeping me on task with my homework, so thank you (thank you for the ice cream too, you really didn't have to do that, but thank you) and sorry.. for the really long responces. Again.. sorry :P But if I don't get the chance to talk to you again.. then good luck on the paper and have a good night and some sweet dreams (: sorry about your stuffed animals too (and sorry for that sorry too... kinda lame, but I'm a lame guy, so whatareyagonnado?) :P. Alright.. last time.. but I just really wanted to wish you good luck one more time :D And.. I'm going to miss you :/ I don't know if I'll get a chance to see you for the rest of this weekend, unless there's some miracle :P Anyway, goodnight, sweet dreams and I <3 you (: [sorry]
Thanks, I'm going to need all the luck I can get :P
Well.. I can always save you one.. and then you can recreate your opinion of me after that :P
You say that now :P Just wait until you have one
Well.. if I had baked them earlier.. and if I were in Martinsville.. I would give you one in a heartbeat
Seeing how I am not, however, I would like to give you one once you return.. if you'd still want one of course
And that something cool would be?
Oh! That something cool :P I heard that it might not be playing in America.. but I may have heard incorrectly.. who knows? It'd be neat if it did play though (:
Nothing that strays too much apart from the rest of the message :P And I hope so too, and I wish I could watch it with you :P (even though that's a doubtful occurance)
Ah well.. just saying that the rest of that message was pretty much the same, just saying "Hope it does" n' all And.. I really really like you too (:. Sorry, I'm bad at inferring as well :P
Haha, that sounds like fun, in a.. "I'm going to read these messages" sort of way :D Oh, did you get the chance to run?. So.. I hope you have a great day! And I hope you have fun with that graduation thing (or at least.. I think that's what you said you were doing.. my memory is poor) if it's not that, then have fun with anything else :)
Well, I like walking you home and stuff, because it means I get to spend more time with you (: Doctor Who did not play because of the holiday and the brownies are.. not that fantastic (I still saved some for you if you'd like them) And, I'm not too awesome, so I wouldn't want to ruin your weekend :P but if you did happen to want to see me (tomorrow maybe) then I'd be available :D Anyway, I hope your day was awesome, goodnight and sweet dreams (:. Alright.. this is a really corny song.. but umm.. (:
Hi
haha.. how's it going?
I just finished some cereal.. . :P
I do indeed
I suppose so
Frosted Flakes :P
haha, yeah :D
Oh.. darn. I was unaware. I'd.. have to walk to practice though. I wouldn't be against it.. I'm just not sure that you'd want me over there  And the brownies aren't.. at all
You wouldn't have to do that. Walking would be just alright
Yeah, walking would be like an adventure. :P
not really :P
haha why?
Well.. more than likely I'd be terrified
Yeah.. terrified. but if I survive.. it'd be a nice story
okay
Oh. Well.. are you going?
Oh, yeah.. same. I mostly just wanted to see you there
If you wanted
I don't know what we'd do though
I would want to. but again.. as I said before :P
Really now?
I'm not too great at swimming.. but I'd be up for it
Well.. I'll save you if you save me
Well.. that'd be cool too. I'd be up for pretty much anything
However, my parents aren't here.. so I'm stuck without a ride to wherever
Aw?. I can totally walk :D
And I have those legs. If you say so.. it'd be neat (:
If you wanted to go to the pool, I wouldn't want to ruin that for you
Good point
I've never seen the amazing skills. but I believe you. Yes, along with brownies, not a lot.. because most had to go to the fundraiser
Alright, me too
okay.. I.. don't know when to do anything, but talk to you later :P. The invisible ones would probably taste better.. but I saved some just for you, so no need for "half ones"
haha, alright. I'll keep that in mind :P. :D
You too. Hi again. unless you're busy of course
Hmm?
What?. Oh.. guess.. . Umm.. you just did a summersault?
Oh.. so what is it?
(:. I like you too 
:D. So how's it going?
doing*. sorry..
Wait.. I don't know. sorry
Me either
Oh, I am okay. how are you?
That's great (:
haha.. you're even greater :D. Doing anything fun today?
Isn't shopping more fun?. And maybe you could
Complete trust
Well.. I think you can do it. just.. don't hurt yourself
haha, that would be just as fun, right?
Exactly. And as long as you're alive, that's all that really matters
First part.. bit iffy . but the second, so true :D
It was as fun as handing out t-shirts could be. Amd the sunburn isn't so bad. so I suppose all in all it was alright
Umm.. no
I don't see why :P
Oh. well.. nah
They were just getting shirts. and I was just the guy helping with that
Sorry for?
When were you cheesy exactly?
Aw.. now I'm curious as to what you said. :/. I suppose I'll never know though
haha, alright. You're pretty amazing yourself (:
Why would you do that?
But.. it could've been fun
I thought girls liked shopping
Oh.. well. if you say so :P
Yeah. If only
That's.. super cute :D. but.. kinda sad
haha. Well.. I loaf you a lot :D. So.. are you doing anything later? Possibly with me maybe?
right now?
I'll take that as a no :P
The maybe= no :P
Well.. you don't sound too certain with yourself. so.. I really wouldn't know :P
sorry
See.. too bad. I'm only free right now. so.. any other time..
But the original right now was before
It means that.. I don't know. That you no longer want to do something :P. with me at least
I don't know. I suppose it's your opinion
Well.. in my opinion I think it'd be really cool to do something with you. but I don't know what your opinion is :P
haha, thanks?
The problem of the matter is when I suppose :P. But it would be pretty neat :D
Yeah.. sorry if that bothers you
Well.. I'm up for whatever.. and whenever.. so you decide.. and if you find that you have found something better to do.. then cool
I would have to walk. which is fine by me
Walk to your house? or the pool? or where?. I don't think I was filled with that information
Ah, alright. Well.. it would be fine if I walked alone
Don't worry.. I wouldn't walk on your watch :D. or on your clock if that helps :P
See, no worries. :D. Whenever you want me there though (:
alright
Why?
I don't live that far . And it's not that hot
I think I can manage :P
Haha.. it's not that hot is it?. Like.. it'd have to be.. pretty crazy outside for that to be the case
Nah. I'll wear a turban. And I'll make it :D
Well... As long as I'm not out of the way
Well.. hmm. I suppose I'd be alright with it then. But.. I can still walk of course (:
haha. okay
haha, why?
Oh..
Why wouldn't I?
And?. That just makes it even better :D. I mean.. unless you found something better to do.. . I wouldn't want to prevent you from that. But I would love to do stuffs with you
:D. Well I'd be honored if I were to be the one you wanted to spend time with today
I am ready . And they are well aware
Yeah.. and I have those brownies. If you want them
Well.. their.. different.. they.. . well you may not like these. Proskater 4 :P. sorry. just sounds like fun :P
the brownies I mean. are different. Like.. no chocolate. "caramel brownies". or "congo cookies" as my mom likes to call some of them
haha.. well alright
neat
oh, no worries. gots it
Awesome! :D. See you soon. bye (:
it's okay. I like you too :D. Goodnight and sweet dreams (:
Haha.. oh yeah, he must be there :P Very snazzy tie :P I hope you're having fun (:
It couldn't have been that fun :P but I really enjoyed it (: And I can never tell whether someone is either making fun of me or giving me a sincere compliment.. so I can't tell if my hair really is "cool".. but I doubt it.. I still look like a dork :P. *sigh* aww :/
I like you too (: But.. still :/ sad face not because of you, so no worries.. just aww Any who.. goodnight and have some sweet caramel dreams too. I hope you had fun (: And thank you.. for being there for me; it meant a lot to me and you mean a lot to me (: I understand, walking home was an awful idea.. and whatever happened is completely my fault Anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams :D
I.. don't know what to say to just a smiley face.. so... (:. I think you're amazing like, a lot. Either that or I'm crazy, but I'm very sure that I'm not everything you do is cool you're just awesome or stuff (: unlike me, of course :P !(sorry) but anyway. I hope you have a really nice day n' all. hi there. sorry
I hope I'm not being a bother. again :P. but.. how are you?
I'm.. okay I suppose. a little bored too :P
Umm.. no. and nothing to do either. but alright.. have fun with that 
Yup... but you know.. I wouldn't want to take up your time with unimportant stuff
That would be extremely kind of you
I don't have any other resort. :P. but I mean.. it's not that important.. so I wouldn't want to waste your time with that stuff. even if it like.. takes a second :P. Just a second wasted
I don't see how you could :P or why you would want to have time for me. but.. I kinda need it.. pretty much today. so.. you know. That would probably be a problem
Oh.. meant the flash drive. my bad. wasn't clear
Eh.. I wouldn't care some other time. but thank you for offering to help
Yes.. . I pretty much need what is on my flash drive today. and I saved it nowhere else
Which was smart of me. It is gone
I.. wasn't the victim.. so it was my fault... And if only you could see what I see :P
I have a mac. so.. no
Not one that works
So essentially.. I'm stuck in a bad predicament. But it's.. whatever I suppose
Alright, thank you. I have plenty of time
If it doesn't, then at least you tried. like.. you didn't even have to do the amount that you did. actually.. you don't have to help me at all
So?
My.. computer isn't even recognizing the device. which is just awesome... and you don't have to help me
Well you don't have to. but thank you. ah.. unfortunately it's not finding what I need.. and it's giving everything a watermark
Oh, it's fine. sigh... it's just whatever
Well.. I have a good feeling like it won't work out on my computer. but either way I wouldn't want to waste your time
You really wouldn't have to do that. I'll just.. figure something out. I don't know
Well.. I'd like the help.. but you're busy
See.. that's the other thing
There you go... I mean.. I could easily walk over with my drive. but.. I wouldn't want to get in the way of anything
Well.. hmm. would you like help with the yard work?
I'm not busy. plus.. like.. since you would be helping me. But I understand if you only want to see me for so much :P
Wouldn't that.. defeat the purpose. but.. alright, I can. I just.. gotta grab it out of my backpack
Sure you want to?
Aww (: I hope today was nice for you (: Goodnight, sweet dreams and I can't wait to see you tomorrow :D. Sorry... but I don't suppose you'd like to go celebrate National Donut Day with me.. maybe? If you don't want to I completely understand.. oh and thank you for helping me with the usb.. even though it still doesn't work, it means a lot to me that you wanted to help in the first place.. Anyway.. have a good day if I don't see you later
That.. sounds like a bunch of fun (: I love making brownies :P
A hint to what?
Oh, no.. I was just saying that I enjoy making them.. even though I barely eat the ones I actually make :P
Mine.. weren't that good.. but I only had that one bite.. but yeah.. I can tell :P I bet yours will be fantastic :D Ooo (: I can retype the paper stuff whilst you make brownies :P. I feel like.. I just noticed that "whilst" doesn't quite fit in that sentence.. while "as" or "while" or "during the time" would... yeah, sorry :P
It is later.. and if you don't wanna do anything than it's cool :P And I am unsure of what stuff you speak of
Well.. you don't have to do either.. I think I'm done with the paper.. maybe.. and I wouldn't wanna waste your time either. So.. I hope you have a fantastic rest of your day (: Too bad I can't say that in person.. but oh well, I know you're busy. Oh.. and sorry for talkin' to you n' stuff. Donut Day alone :P And I have still yet to sign your year book :/ Oh well :P
Nope. Just if you don't want to :P
Alright, sounds important
I don't know what you'd like to do.. but I doubt that
Well.. in this case.. cupcakes are still more important
Nah.. I wouldn't think so... Sorry.. but if you fell asleep then.. goodnight
sure?. I'm still not awesome.... It's really nice outside (:. Soo.. have a nice day n' all I hope stuff is fun. Oh.. and if you were serious about "wanting to see me" then I'm sorry.. because I wouldn't be able to unless it was soon or really late... I mean.. not that you wanted to in the first place. yeah.. sorry... hope you have a fantastic day ):. (: * sorry.. fingers slipped :P
Hi. If you're there. See.. sorry.. I would have loved to.. and I would still love to.. not sure if it's too late though... I hope graduation is fun (:. Hey (: Hope you're having a good day. sorry... :P. Hi. Unless you're busy.. because.. yeah I suppose I can go
How are you?
I am.. okay I suppose. I made some scones. I suppose not.. :P. sorry..
You know.. if you wanted one.. I made a few too many
They.. don't. They could though
Probably not. but if you want one.. you could have one... but.. you know...
Probably. Maybe tomorrow.. if you still want one then
I could even give it to you at school :P. Anyway.. you're probably busy.. so I should get out of your way
Well.. the only one that would open was the wrong paperYou don't have tomuch like the 'b' in unintebtional.. Which also looks like a thumb.
Invasion of the thumbs!
Well I'm sorry you had to use sarcasm. I shouldn't have made any assumptions.
Wow! You must be a great dancer then!
And you also need to be light on your feet.
Is that what you are?
Oh I see.
Ninjutsu?. I'm sure they teach it somewhere, but Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Kung Fu, and the likes are more popular?. Maybe.. I haven't seen Ninjutsu taught in Blacksburg, but it could be!. https://takelessons.com/blacksburg-va/ninjutsu-lessons. You could totally become a ninja.
Except you'd actually become a ninja!
I doubt their Ninjutsu expertise, but I'm sure they are experienced in some form of martial art.. I believe they used to compete, but I forget which one they participated in.. And after a quick search, Ryan is a black belt in Judo.
Sweet dreams to you!. Goodnight and sleep tight!
Tah tah for now.. I miss you.
Goodnight.
You should try I-Tim Pad when you go to Thailand!
It's ice cream!. But it's made on an ice block I think.. I think it translated to fried ice cream, but that's not how it was prepared.. But it looked tasty.. They added the cream and the strawberries to a cold surface and scraped it together into the ice cream.. Good morning!!!
I did not try it. I was watching a video of street vendors making food :P. And I thought it looked good.
I'm afraid I did not show it to you.. But I'm glad someone did.
What will the day bring today?
Tomorrow I'm probably cleaning gutters and raking leaves.. A fishing village? That sounds cool!. Oh! And maybe you can swim with the dolphins!!. Probably not, but I know you can in some places.
It won't be all that fun, but thanks anyway.. I should probably stop trying to talk to you so often and let you have more time to your vacation.
I doubt it, but thanks for the optimism.. Talking to me isn't as great as a fishing village.. It's like the game "River King", but in real life!
Bye.. Sorry, you must have sent this to the wrong person.. Sweet dreams, regardless.. Oh, but none for you, as it is morning.. So good morning.. Have a nice time.. I'll try to be sparse.
Tah tah for now.. The mail sure is accumulating. You've received about 5 envelopes!
Good morning!. (hug)(hug). I believe it's a combination of letters from the various banks you have accounts with and little cards from your school.. While your sister and mother have all the things.. Their piles are up to the ceiling already.
I'm sure something is important in the mix.. (I'm joking about how big the piles are though)
Still a good amount though.. Goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra.. I should be off.. Bye for now.. http://blog.swagbucks.com/2015/06/swagbusters-swag-code-extravaganza.html. I'll be thinking of you throughout my day. Sleep well, my princess.. Good morning.
I saw a fledgling today.. My cat tried to eat it, but my dad got it out of her mouth.. And it's safe and sound now.
It was old enough to fly, but it was still fuzzy.
That could happen!. I hope you have a great day!. We finished working around 7.
Thanks. What will you be up to?. A new Steven Universe just came out!
That sounds awesome!. I'll be sleeping!. And wow! there will be a new episode every day until the 19th!. Tomorrow I'm going to Ohio to visit Cody though.. So that should be a neat little excursion.
Tah tah for now.. Good morning.. Goodnight I mean!
I'm leaving around noon.
Thank you.. How was your day?
Okay. Well goodnight.. ..*. Sleep well. I hope you have a great day tomorrow too.
I love you.
Ohio is nice.. I arrived at 6pm.. Good morning.. Have a nice day.
I explored the downtown area, which had a lot of stores.. That's all I've seen so far though.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I wish I didn't want to talk to you as much as I do.
Columbus is a huge city.. I haven't experienced it all yet.. I can keep you updated if you'd like.. Good morning.. Goodnight.. Have you yet heard of "Hack the Planet"? http://hacktheplanet.mlh.io/. How's Bangkok?
Hello.. I love you too.
Yesterday we toured Cody's college campus. The day before we toured the downtown area.
There was a lego store and we made each other out of lego.
Mhmm!. They didn't have that many options, but we were able to make something reminiscent of each other.
Have you tried i-tim pad yet?
Really? Gap said the street food was really good. And it's street food :P
Yes!
It's "fried ice cream". I couldn't tell you. There could be a certain street that has more street vendors.
How is it hot?
I love you so so so much too.
Om nom!
Can you receive links?. http://migrationology.com/2011/05/top-16-bangkok-street-food-sanctuaries/
That's okay!. Who needs wifi when you have Tom Kha?
That's okay!. I'm assuming your using a tablet of some sort.. And even if you're not, it's okay!. Tom Kha sounds really good!. Like a creamier hot and sour soup.. Larb pla duk (catfish salad) sounds tasty.
Neat!. I can ask Gap too.. He might recall somewhere.
(hug)(hug)
I had slept on an inflatable mattress that Gap brought with him, but since he has left, I'm sleeping on the sofa, which is more comfortable and warm.
He was, he went to Pittsburgh to visit family. He'll be back Sunday.
As far as food goes, we had a Gyro at Gyro Express.. Which was really tasty.
Right now I'm eating an old apple though.
I'm not sure.. Cody said that there is a burger joint called Rally's that we should try.
Until I decided to eat it.
Columbus also has fancy menu options at fast food restaurants that aren't common in Virginia.
And there's a fancy Wendy's that is supposedly expensive (we haven't been there yet).
And it serves it's food on actual plates!
Oh, no. I forgot what I saw on the billboard. It was some sort of specialty food.
It did not involve pineapple.
I've gotta be fit for when you get back.. I think the item could have been some sort of sweet potato concoction.
Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I had missed talking to you.. So thank you.
You're silly!
I don't mind, so long as I get to talk to you.
(hug)(hug)(hug)
^3^
I love you too.
Thanks! Sweet dreams for now!
I wish I could enjoy the food you're having!. And petting tigers and riding elephants looks awesome!
The tiger looks so happy though!. It's like "This is awesome!". And you're like "It's going to eat me!"
Know what?
Or someone else you're related to.. I just looked through the photos you were tagged in.. It's all I've got to keep me company.. I sometimes wear tanktops under shirts or to sleep in (namely the one I own that's is striped).
I really like photos of you.
No need to worry about it. I can see them on Facebook.
I look silly about 100% of the time, but I can take pictures if you would like them.. Goodnight.
Sleep well, my sweet.. Good morning.
Good morning!
I love you too!
That's definitely you!. You're also a sleepyhead!. :3. Have fun today!. What are the plans for today?. Packing?
Street food sounds exciting!. The Snake Farm might be scary, but that's just me :P. Have so much fun!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Good morning!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Thank you for the phone call (:
Wow!. And you survived?. Lived to tell the tale?. That's pretty cool!
But it could still choke hold you!. Like wrestle you down!. Kind of like how I'll wrestle you down when you come back! (I won't choke hold you of course)
Unless you would not like that. I can contain myself.. But that's cool!. Snakes are scaly!
You're great!. I liked the voice message!
Mhmm!
I like you too, so that might have persuaded my feelings.
Time for sleeps!. Not for me, but for you!
You don't have to.. You'll have me when you get back.. I love you.
Sweet dreams, Cutie!
Sleep tight!
(hug)(hug)
I'm waiting for Cody to wake up, then I'll see what he wants to do.
I know!. I've woken him up three times already :P. He had a long day at work yesterday, so I'm sure that's why he's still sleeping.
Hey! It's midnight! You should be sleeping!. Yeah, he works at the movies!. Inside Out (the Pixar movie) came out Friday, and it was busy yesterday.
Happy Father's Day to your dad too!. :P. Tah tah for now, Cutie!
Have a great day tomorrow.
Just say it's a cipher, and they're supposed to decode it!
Now you can say "It was a cipher, but you guys aren't supposed to see it."
I love you so so much!. I hope you are super cuddly now and even cuddlier when you come back!
Sweet dreams to you too!
Tah tah for now!
Good morning. I just arrived to Blacksburg.. Be safe traveling today!. If I read the itinerary correctly, then that should be appropriate.
Goodnight!. How was your day today?
We spent the whole day driving to Blacksburg.
Yeah, it was nice.. What did you do today?
That does sound great!
I don't know yet!. Cody is in town (he came with us!). So I'm going to see what he wants to do.
And you, have a nice sleep!
Sweet dreams.. Get some beauty sleep! Not that you need it.
Goodnight.
I can't wait for them.. I love you too!
Good morning!
I love you too!. Have a great day.
(hug)(hug). Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Have fun in Singapore!. Good morning!. Have a nice day.
Hi.. How are you this fine morning?. How is Singapore?
Wow!. Have you been to the gardens yet?. Or did you just see them while passing by?. I hope you get to visit them! I'm sure it will be pleasant.
That's great for you.. I hope you have fun.
Definitely.
I would be sad that you would be gone.. But it's for you, not me.. And I'm sure.
I can't wait.. (hug)(hug). A week of awesome food and a good learning experience?. Sounds awesome.. I love you.
Have a great day today!
Spent time with Cody.
Mhmm.. I think we'll see Gap tomorrow.
What will you do today?
But what will you be doing?. Is it confidential?
Aww... Okay.
Cody and I went on a walk.. We played some games on his Wii U that he brought.. We also started watching a movie, but we never finished it.. We sat on the porch and talked for a while.. Nothing really special though.. I won't pry to hear what you've done.. I'm sure it was amazing though.
Definitely sounds amazing.. Especially since you'll be there.
Sounds like a once in a lifetime thing.
I would love to.. Especially Japan.
I love you too!
Thank you!. Tah tah for now!. You are lovely.
Bye, Lovely!. My one and only.
You're going to bed? :P
Bye, Gorgeous!
Okay, Cutie!. I love you so so so much!
:3. What would you like for your birthday?. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Anything else?
Oh! I should go check!
I hadn't seen it yet, and it's hard to miss.
:3. Any items?. Anything you'd like other than the things I already plan to give you?
That can be arranged!. I love you!. Have sweet dreams!. Goodnight.. I want to surprise you with gifts, so you better watch out!
Tah tah for now, Cutie Pie!. Are you still interested in a violin?
I'll see what I can do!
You don't say!. My mother has one that's a bit rough around the edges, but it could be fixed.
I was going to take it to a music store to see if it would be worth fixing or not.. It needs a new bow, but other than that it seems all intact.. It may need new strings too.. I wasn't going to tell you, because it would be a surprise, but since you said you were looking at one, I wouldn't want you to buy one before I had the chance to give you one.
Mhmm!. I'll leave the rest of the gifts as a surprise!
Just as hugs?. Does that mean those are not necessary?. I love you too!
I definitely want!. Sweet dreams to you!!. I will check on the mail today and tell you in the morning (at night for me)
I love you so so so much too!. Tah tah for now!. This is Ace to Flying Tiger!. The eagle has landed, repeat-- the eagle has landed!. The egg is in the nest!. (The diploma is at your house.). Have a nice day today.
Goodnight and sweet dreams! (hug). How was your day??
My day has been alright.. I've been in and out of the house a few times already.. I was going to check on your house some time soon.
I was hanging with Cody. Then we were hanging out to dry, because it rained.
:P. I won't bother you for much longer.. You should get to sleep.
Sounds like fun.
He's taking a nap.. But I think we're already dry :P
Thank you.. I hope you have one too!. Especially on the walking tour.
Tah tah for now.. Sweet dreams.
I hope you know that you are gorgeous. Sleep tight.. Good morning, beautiful.. When Marnie Was There is going to play at the Lyric when you come back (it will start on the 3rd)!. I think it would be very nice seeing the movie with you!. I'd like to ask you on a date! (:. Please say yes!
*celebrates*. *tackle!!!*. Goodnight for later.
Hello.
I love you too.. I spent time with Cody.. We walked downtown for a bit, and I watered plants and everything.. What did you do?
We played a few games together.. Nothing too interesting-- otherwise I would have brought it up!
I don't see why not!
Nothing has.
You sang karaoke????. Save me a song, please!. Goodnight and sweet dreams, your day sounds amazing!
It's Cody's last full day.. We're planning on seeing Gap later. Not sure what will happen after that!
Not like you!. I can't wait for you to come back into my life.
I was trying to be dramatic!. I just mean I hope to see you in person soon.
Oh! I was mistaken when I believe that it was the 2nd.. I can't wait to see you then!. Bye.
Good morning!
My day has been a-okay.. Good morning!. I didn't know you were a time traveler!! Just one more thing to add to your resume!
I have a copy of harvest moon that you are free to play. I'm sure the dream was a much nicer experience!. And wow! Stairs? That's amazing!. I'm so proud of you!. I know those are not your only talents, so that's not the only reason to be proud.. You are really and truly fantastic.. I love you.. Goodnight.
Wow! You're like Rocky Balboa, but way cooler!. That sounds like quite the day though, one deserving of hugs.. I hope you find some soon! If you don't, I'll have some waiting for you.. Good morning!
Have a nice day in Ipoh!
Cody left yesterday.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Hello there!. How was your day?
That sounds awesome.
I'm okay.. I have an orthodontist appointment later today, and after that I'm going to take Molly out to drive around in a parking lot.
That will be another day. This is just for my retainer.
Yes. They will likely tighten it.
Last I checked there were 2.. But that was a few days ago.. (Three days to be exact). I can go check.. Would she like to know now?
The toyota and your sisters.
It could have changed in that time!
When do you expect the nissan to be back?
Okay.. I will definitely notify you by morning.
It's not a problem to pass by :P
Thanks.. Have a nice sleep.
Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Sorry.
I wish I could say that I did.. I'm working on "working on one".. And by that I mean, I'm working on gathering supplies and whatnot.
It's a wood project.. I'm not sure how it'll go, but we'll see.. You'd probably think it's a waste of time, but I think it might be interesting.
If you wish!
Sure.. We might even have easels to work on.
Sounds good.
I can't wait.
Of course.
I think I have a few lying around here too.. So I can bring some too.
If you would prefer that.
I can't wait either.
I'll let you sleep now!. Sorry for keeping you up with all of my ruckus.
Of course. You can have all of my time.
I do!. I have things I wanted to try with you.. They are surprises though.. So you'll have to wait to find out what they are.. I'll also have to wait until I know you'd actually want to participate.. So we'll both be doing our fair share of waiting.
There are lots of surprises.. http://blog.virginia.org/2013/06/5-hidden-outdoor-gems-of-virginia/. Just so you can get a "taste"
Of course!. You're the one I would like to spend my time with!
I love you too!. The orange car is not in the driveway yet.. So just the two still.. Your sisters orchid is about to bloom though. I'd say in a day or two.. I think your mother also had an orchid-- it currently has two flowers, and another on the way!. What type of violin were you interested in? Stradivarius? Guarneri?. Good morning!
Okay. The music shop by the library has odd hours.. I was going to take the violin there to see if it's worth fixing up.. I'm sure it plays, but I'd want it to be at least a little nicer for you.
The building is rather dark!. That must be it!
Thanks.. What will you do in Ipoh today?. Goodnight.. Sweet dreams, Leandra.
I hope you sleep well.
Have fun in Kuala Lumpur
Oh.. Right. It's July 1st.. Or is it?. I may or may not still be confused.. I'm just working on things.. I broke a fancy screwdriver, and now I'm trying to fix it.. You wouldn't think that a little metal loop and spring would be so important, but they are.
Bye.. Have safe travels.
I'm sorry if I distracted you from any of your vacation.. Good morning.
Have a great day today!. A great last day?. I believe that's what you told me this morning!. Have fun!. I hope your day will be as lovely as you!.
Well. The screwdriver put up a fight, but I finally put it back together.. The attic has also seen some slight improvements.. As has my room.
I suppose I don't have a whole lot to comment on.. But that's been my day.. I've been doing a bit of research on a few things as well.
It was one of those "8 in 1" screwdrivers. They're tricky.
I stopped by your house today. The nissan has still yet to appear!. But your sisters orchid is doing well.. Only one of the flowers blossomed.
And there is also only one flower.. Don't tell her!
Because something might happen between now and the time she sees it :P
Thank you.. I will water the flowers on the 2nd.
No need to.
As long as you're rewarding me with hugs or something like that, then that's okay.. Otherwise I don't need a reward.
Awesome!. "When Marnie Was There" plays from the 3rd to the 9th.. Which is perfect, as long as you still wish to go!
(:. I love you.
How was the shower?
That's good!. Maybe you can have that style bathroom in your house when you're older.
You could totally do it!. I believe in you!. Umm... I'm sure people would say that "Interior Design" is a skill.. Maybe :P
(Ahh, I don't know how to respond.). Have a great day!
Is that an interesting book?
That sounds pretty interesting.. You are quite the cutie, Leandra.. Just thought you should know that.
Oh, I'm just Peter.
:3. I hope to make you happy when you return.. http://i.imgur.com/iw6SIlV.jpg. (I saw this little comic, and thought it was neat. I hope that you do as well, but its okay if you do not.)
I love you too!. Have a nice flight!!!. Goodnight and sweet dreams if you choose to sleep on the plane!
I love you too!. I don't know what the time is for you, so sweet morning dreams!. (or night dreams)
Good morning then!
I hope you have some nice day dreams.
How soon?
That's not all that soon, but awesome!
I'll just have to find ways to pass the time! :P. Just kidding :P. I already have things I need to have finished before you come back.
Close :P. Thank you for talking to me!. I'll let you get to your day!
Thanks.. I'll try to dream of you.. (In case you didn't know, you're already the girl of my dreams.)
Tah tah for now, Cutie Pie.
How soon would you like a violin?
Oh.. I see.. That's good.. I'm a little disappointed, because I wanted to be the one to give you a violin.. but I'm glad you have one.. The nissan is not in the driveway still. I finished watering the plants for this week. There is "urgent" mail, but it likely won't be too late by the time you and your family return. There were two kittens living under your storage shed when I stopped by today-- I'm not sure if they will be there when you get back, but I thought that you should know.. Is there anything else I should do? Is there anything you would like before you arrive?
I love you too!. I measured the one I have, and it should be full-size.. I'll make sure it's ready for you then!. Maybe you'd like to help?. It's fine if not, of course!
Well. It's currently 4:14am, so I'm doing what most people do at that time and lying in bed :P. I'm alright.. How are you?. And what are you up to?. You seem to be up early too!
Naps sound good!. You can also nap on me whenever you're in Blacksburg.'. Just an option.. Throwing that out there.
Of course!
Good morning to you too!. I think I'll nap as well.
Sweet dreams, Cutie Pie!
Should I prep your house for your return?. I can bake a cake that says "Welcome Home" or set up balloons.. Or I can fluff your pillows.. Anything you want!. Just let me know.. I can try to fulfill your wishes to the best of my abilities.
Are you sure?. Just think of the possibilities!
I've heard those are very dangerous :P. And I don't have one, but I can see what I can do!
I can make a picnic happen!. What kinds of foods would you like?
Will do!. I'll pack the basket!
(hug)(hug). How was the nap?
You too.
I also skipped it :p
With your family?. Tah tah for now.
Oh.. I was unaware of your situation.. Please be safe!. Where will your family be?
I see.. Where are you going then?. I don't want to assume Blacksburg.
Have fun.. Keep your wits about you.
Be safe.. I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you.. Bye for now.. Sorry for being so distracting.
I was going to paint with Ms. Alicia.. But I'm free for the most part.. She said to come by between 12:30 and 5.
If she has leftover paint, she might let us.. I'll let you continue on with your day.. Bye for now.
Will do.
How's your day been so far?. Boop!
That's good.. Have a good nights sleep.. I hope you enjoy the fireworks tomorrow.. You won't have the chance to rest in my lap, but the display should make up for that.. Pssst...!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Bye for now.. http://www.watchcartoononline.com/ai-yori-aoshi-episode-1-english-dubbed. Just kidding.. Sorry.. goodnight.
No. It's fine.. Good morning.. Have a nice Independence Day.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
I did.. I hope you travel well today.
I love you/. .*
I can't wait for Monday.
Oh. I guess that's when I would see you next.. I shouldn't make that assumption though.
I'm going to go paint.. I'll try and do as good a job as you would!
I'll do both.. Because I'm painting for both you and I.. myself*. Hello.
How's the application coming along?
Good luck.. I lack in the necessary qualifications.
But I don't have anything to show to them.
That's all I have right now.. Would you still like to see "When Marnie Was There" with me?
Just making sure.. Does the ChallengePost link through GitHub, or should I link that in the description box?. We could be part of the same team.. Unless you wanted to be alone.
http://challengepost.com/JustSomePita?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav. Is that the correct link?. Never mind, I believe it is.
Thanks.. Team?. I will assume no.
What kind of name would you like?
I would like your input.. Team "Club"?
Because it's a synonym.. W1_kr4YOfx. Here's the code for you to join.
It's two words "Invent Adventure". If that's okay.
You're perfect.
:/
Okay.
I will refrain upon calling you that next time.. Sorry for feeling poorly.. Goodnight.
Just unloved.
It's not your fault.. If you don't love someone, you just don't, and that's not your fault.. Sorry.. Goodnight.
Thanks. I'll stop bothering you now.. Have a nice day tomorrow.
Thanks.
Sorry.. I feel like you stopped liking me for some reason.
I'm sorry then.. I'm just confused then.. I'll see you around.
I'll try to get to sleep.
Sleep well.. Hello.
How's it going?. Is your room coming together?
If that's the case, then don't worry about coming over later.. I'm okay. I'm just feeling lonely.
I shouldn't distract you from your room.. Good luck.
Of course not.. I know you've got this "in the bag". Some of your room may be in a literal bag.
If you're taking any of it to a donation center, you can count on me to tag along (if you'd like that, of course)
You can count on me, if you need a hand.
Not a problem.
I have apples, bananas, strawberries, cherries, and blueberries.
I have spinach, mini sweet peppers, and baby carrots.. No avocado, unfortunately.
I have the boost nutrition powder, there may be Mylo protein powder, but there is definitely peanut butter.
Okay.. You can bring Animal Crossing too, if you'd like to play :P
Was that really a hint?
Well well well!. (I didn't mean to hit that)
How's cleaning going?
That's okay.. If it means you won't have time to come over, don't worry then.
I'll be sure to be ready for you then.
Awesome!. I'll try to be the best for you.
I'll try to be both then.
I'll see you in a bit!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-yqvT8vKZc
I know how you like bears :P. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UGwE1Gq-BQ. https://www.google.com/search?q=cc3d+copter+control&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8. https://www.google.com/search?q=gopro+video+transmitter&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8. http://www.amazon.com/Goliton%C2%AE-Transmitter-Real-time-Output-Camera/dp/B00G6CDDIW. http://www.amazon.com/Boscam-TS351-RC805-Transmitter-Receiver/dp/B00GGC60N2. https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+use+wifi+with+fpv+to+stream+video&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
(hug)(hug). It's just so you don't have to start from scratch.. But you'll likely have to anyway.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Good luck fixing your laptop too.
I did nothing worth thanking.. Unless you wanted me to take a look under the hood for you.. I could check the oil or the cpu.. Make sure it's running at its full rpm's.. You know.. computer stuff.
List your stuff or my stuff too?. I'm fine just listing your stuff.. If that's what you had in mind.. But I have items as well.
Okay. I can bring over a few things.. What time would we be listing items?. Oh wait. I can only list 1 item in each category.
I think I can list a new thing after the first thing sells.. It lasts for a while though.. I'll try to be there then!
I'm on the way now!. Just kidding.. I'll let you know in the morning.. Goodnight for now.
See you soon.
(hug)(hug)
Chocolate cupcakes with a cream cheese and chocolate chip filling and chocolate cream cheese frosting.. Will you be baking tomorrow? What time would I need to be out of your hair?. Or you can make panda cupcakes.
(I've made you the chocolate cupcakes I mentioned before-- which is why I suggested them.). Cakes can be fun to decorate.. As for types of things to bake.. I'm not sure.
Sure.
And they won't run away from us?. :D
Awesome!!!. Hello.
How did you sleep?
That's good.
I slept alright.
When were you going to the DMV?
Both sound awesome.
Did you want me to drive to Christiansburg?
I should drive to your house though>. ?*
I would like to, but I should probably avoid driving the car.
Sounds good.. See you then.
I'll check here for it.
I found it.. It was under the chair you were sitting in.
Of course.. You definitely have two missed calls.
Me.. Trying to find your phone.
Not a problem.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMq9he-5HUU
I have more classes to add in August, so I can only check for three classes as of now.. Oops. Four classes.. The schedule has also not been made clear yet.. But the exam period is from the 14th to the 17th of December.
4. Do you need them?
Thanks!. No worries, you can sell them!
My morning is alright.. What should I be doing every day?
Oh. Since you're doing something every day... you said I should too!. But should it be graphic design? comics? stories? or animation?. Or anything?
Okay. I'll do some exploring.
I want a program that lets you trace over the previous frame.. I think that would be cool.. I looked into it, but I only found tv paint.. (and various programs)
Yeah, but I wish I could do it as I animate.. When I hit new layer it would make the old layer about 50% transparent (and maybe have a setting where you can adjust this)
And then you could draw on top of it.
I think I would need to decide between Anime Studio and TV Paint.
I have Sketchbook, but not Sketchbook pro! :P. Is that a 3D program?
I like 2D animation.. SAI is a windows only program.
Cinema 4D is something the 3D class is going to learn this semester.. Flipbook looked good.
I suppose I'll try to learn the animation is Photoshop CC. in*. I have access to all of those programs.. I might as well use them.
I've done similar searches.. To no avail.. Thank you though.. You can get back to your coding camp.
I'll try.
I would love to!!!!. It looks like a great movie (:
What time would be a good time for you?
That sounds dandy.
See you there.
Expect me a bit late!. Don't worry though, I'll be there shortly.. Sorry that I missed 10:10
What happens at 10:10?
Or what made it so specific?
Oh.. Makes sense then.. Well I'll be right over.. Anything I should bring?
Okay.. Anything else?
Boop.
Hello.
If that's what you want!. We have meatloaf here.
It's the standard loaf of meat.. Or you could have waffles?. Because those are fun to make.
We can also make noodles, if you would like to have more of your sauce.
I'm not sure if we have veggies.. But we might!. This looks like a good deal, because one of the games is factory sealed and would be worth around $80 by itself.
I'm worried that I wouldn't get it at the last minute.. Someone might "snipe" it out from under me.
Okay.. Those are some really nice games, but I will refrain.. Have you decided not to come?
That depends on when you are available.
Then you can come over now.
Or I can come to you.. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Electronic-SPACE-INVADERS-handheld-pocket-travel-portable-carabiner-video-game-/191592811086?hash=item2c9bd24a4e. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Basic-Fun-Space-Invaders-Carabiner-Edition-NEW-Sealed-in-Box-/201362337967?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2ee22170af. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Legend-of-Zelda-The-Wind-Waker-Nintendo-GameCube-2003-No-Manual-/151760156930?hash=item23559c3902. Hi Cutie Pie!!!!!111111!1111!!1!!!
I love you too!!!. http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery. Make a wish.
How goes the day?
My day is fine. I think I'll start on a few projects.
I might make a plasticine sculpt of Lily from Bear & Bear.. That way I have all of the possible angles that she can be in.
I already had the clay.. I don't have much else.
I was thinking I could make a puppet at some point, but right now she would just be flat.. It's so that I can see every angle of her face when I go to draw something.
She wouldn't be in a pose, is what I mean.
How's it going?
Plasticine is a type of clay.. :P. I haven't started yet, because it involves taking some previously made sculpts apart.. I'm not sure if I have the heart to do it :P
But I may as well, right?
The Curse of the Werekitten character.
Fortunately, I have pictures already.
Bye.. How are you now?
I'm alright.. Sculpting hasn't progressed as well as I would have hoped.
I'm just not getting it as detailed as I desired.
I'm just not doing a good enough job.
We'll see.. Did you happen to want to see me today?
Really??
No way!!!1!111!. That's pretty cool (:. Was there anything you wanted to do?
Oh?. I'll look for my rackets.
Oh... Okay.. So what else then?
I hear you like onion volcanoes.... But I'm not sure what you want.. I have drawing and painting supplies. We could draw each other.
Well you should tell me.. Unless you think it has gotten too late.
Tell me what you want.
Would you like to make angel food cake?
Well you can come on over, Red Rover.
Sorry to remind you of it then!
That does sound scary.
Only a few times in Elementary School.
Okay.. Have a nice day then.
None come to mind.. You could code. Frisbee is always an option.. Making food is too.. But I cannot think of anything specific.
I wish you could just spend time with me.
But you can't.. You have to have something to do first.. I like playing Fluxx with you.
I suppose I have a digital painting to work on.. I invited you, but one of the prerequisites seemed to be that you needed something for us to do.
That sounds delightful.
Thank you for the invitation.
Sounds great.. Not certain where the rackets are, but I will be sure to look.
No need then?
We should use the actual tennis racket.
Okay. I think I know who this "Danny" is.
I went to his instagram (which he sent via text) and then found his last name-- which I then checked on facebook.. So I remember him.. However.. Sam doesn't seem to have him on her friends list.. :P. Quite the mystery.
If he's the same Danny that I found on facebook.... Maybe.. He seemed pretty nice.
See you then.. I'll need to find some paper :P
Hey there!
How's your Birthday so far/. ?*
I don't know how it happened, but you're welcome!. And how I lost my socks...
I didn't even notice!. Have a nice time!. Bye for now!!!
Cool!. How is it?
I mowed for a bit.. I also mowed at your house.. Right now I'm taking things apart and cleaning them.. Then... I'm putting them back together!!!
Definitely.. Thanks for stealing me last night.
!!!!1. Awesome!. (:
Have fuN!. Solve some mysteries there, Scoob!
:3. I hope that you can keep me posted while you're out there (:
Thank you! (:. You've still got quite some time left for Birthday Festivities!. Happy Birthday!. I think the price of the hard drive went down to $89.
I love you too. Bye for now!
Then you should tell me! :$. I think you're pretty sweet, yourself! Thank you for spending time with me!. I think you are quite something, Leandra!. I love you so much, Leandra!
Thank you!!!. How is Chile?. Is it... chilly?. Are you going to.. eat chilly?. Will that chilly also be chilly?. :P. You could eat chilly chilly in chilly Chile.. (too much)
Hi, Leandra! You're awesome!!. Autumn is nice (:. You'll get to experience Autumn twice!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I love you too, Cutie!
That sounds like a whole lot of fun! I spent the day playing various board games with Katy and her friends for her Birthday.. Sweet dreams to you too, Lovely Leandra!
We played Apples to Apples, Headbandz, and The Forbidden Island.. It was interesting.. And fun :P
It's an island that you try to escape before it floods!. It's pretty intense :P. How are you?
It's involves land cards that act as the board.. They can be removed as the island floods
It was pretty cool. A bit complicated at first though.
Definitely.. How's it going for you?
I am alright. How is Santiago?. Are you having an amazing time?
La Serena is in Santiago?. Or... I must be mistaken.
Santiago is the capital of Chile.. So you must be nearby at least.
I did not use my day the way I would have preferred, but it's okay.. I'm glad to hear that you're having a good time!
I'm saving you all the hugs!. Don't you worry either. You'll definitely get them on a Friday!
You know it!
Better prepare yourself.
It will be your choice.. But just know... you'll either be riding with a stranger, or someone strange.
But I'll only be driving alone for half of the time that I'm on the road!. http://daisyallen.bandcamp.com/releases
I haven't listened all the way through, but what I have heard sounds nice enough.
That's okay. It's late, and you've got big days ahead of you!. It's 9:53?. I may be wrong, as I was before (with thinking you were in Santiago.). Goodnight and sweet dreams. I love you.
I've got a few hugs lying around here.. You're free to them!
Night night, Cutie Pie!. Here are some images and clips of a tiny cat: http://lovemeow.com/2014/04/elfie-the-rescue-dwarf-cat. What are you doing still awake?. I thought you went to bed hours ago!
That's the impression I had, but not my initial thought,. Good morning!
I love you too!
I've been trying to sketch the characters for that show.. I'm not really sure what style to go with.. But I'll find it!. What are you doing?. I hope your day is great too!
Have fun!!. (:
Thanks! (:
And you are mine :3. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
That's great (:. I would have too, if I got the chance to see you!!!
Good morning!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
You are my star-- one so radiant and so bright, that it would be an insult to group you in a constellation.
I love you too!!. You're so great!! (:
Silly :P. The artist kind of looks like he's wearing a chef's hat.
Sweet dreams!. I'll definitely show you once I'm finished!
Tah tah for now, Gorgeous!
Good morning!. I love you so very much!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
(:. Sweet dreams, Cutie!
Hi! (:
I love you!. Goodnight!
Good morning, Leandra! I love you too!!!!1. How'd that "1" get there? :P
Probably!!1. (:. You're amazing!!. Sorry for being redundant, but I thought I should remind you of your awesome-ness anyway.
Is today your free day is that tomorrow?. Or*
Whoa!. That's fancy!. Better than taxi's too!. I've heard horror stories :P. The laptop charger that I bought recently has stopped charging my laptop. I may not be able to say goodnight later, so goodnight and sweet dreams.. I fear it may have been a fake.. I've "jerry-rigged" it to slightly work, but I cannot move it, or else it will stop working again.. I've found one (from what people say is a more reputable source).. Goodnight and sweet dreams, by the way!
I love you too cutie!. It will be $62.50 (in a bulk package) or $69 (in a retail box). Which is better than the $89 replacement offered by the Apple website. I'll just have to make sure the seller is as reputable as the claims I have seen suggest.. I still have some battery left to say that you're amazing too!. Good morning, Cutie Pie!
How are you??. I love you!. Have a great free day!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. How were the horses?
That's awesome!. I'm glad you're safe!!!
Take your time!
It was okay.. I went to a church yard sale in hopes of finding a charger for my laptop, and there was one, but someone else picked it up before I did.. My mother had a nice time there though!. It's her favorite yard sale.. I apologize. That's not what you want to hear.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. Enjoy the rest of your vacation with penguins.
What's so cool?
We had a "Pork Roast" at the church.. Which involved eating and being chased by children.
You're awesome!. Since you were planning on retrieving your vehicle from Blacksburg on the weekend of the 29th, would you like to go on a date with me then?. Or would you be busy.. I understand if you would be, and I respect your decision if you decline.
Great!. Don't you worry about a thing. I will have it planned for you.
Hopefully it won't disappoint.
I was thinking Sunday afternoon-- unless you would prefer Saturday.. Both can work too, if you wish.. I'll just plan for two dates (:
I'll be sure to leave you with enough time to spend with your mother!
The occasion is to see you!. And because you'll be around to be seen!. I'll swallow my frog for the following Saturday too.. Just so you know that there will be time.. I can't wait for the pictures (:. That can be part of the date!. Be sure to get enough sleep for your awesome day tomorrow!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Oh, I will make the appointment for the Driver Improvement class for the following Saturday.. I can't recall if they offer the class on Wednesday, but I'm pretty sure it's only Saturday.. Goodnight!
I will be sure to!. Are there any particular activities you would like to participate in when you're in Blacksburg?
I will keep that in mind!
I do have a tent.. A two person tent at that!. We can totally go, but I'd like to somewhere super safe (I've heard scary stories about camping). I'll look into it now.. Would you prefer to camp the weekend you are in Blacksburg?
We can definitely camp!
11/21-11/29. It's actually my Thanksgiving break, as I do not have a fall break.
When is yours?. I will likely be mostly available-- if you want to see me.. Goodnight again. It's getting late (for you). Sweet dreams!. I love you so much!
Good morning, Lovely!. How are the penguins?. Have a safe drive back to La Serena, and a nice flight home! (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I hope I'll be able to talk to you in the morning. (9:45-10am? That's probably a hopeful time) Have a great first day of classes.. Feel free to call me at any time.
Good morning, Cutie Pie! That's awesome (:
I love you too! (:. How has your day been?. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
You may if you wish.. Or you may call in the morning.
You can call me whenever you want!!. (:. I love you! Goodnight, Leandra.
Sweet dreams!
Good morning.
(hug)(hug)
I'm alright. How are y-- *tackled*. How are you?
That's good!
Are you going to have a nice day at school?
What's on the agenda?
Cool!. Doesn't sound like you'll be in class for very long.. What else do you plan to do?
What project is that?
Oh. Neat!
Yard work and a bit of soldering.
My laptop charger.. It looked simple enough to do, and if it doesn't work, the charger was already "useless" and I can buy a new one instead.
Me too. I was going to Home Depot to buy heat shrink tubing.. If you needed me to do anything-- I can do that too!
Don't worry. I have so many.
Don't worry about saving any for me either.. There's enough for the both of us,. .*. I love you. Have a nice day today, Leandra.
:3
Tah tah for now.. I love you so so so so much!. Just so you know.. I'm also thinking about you.. Just to throw that out there.. Keep being wonderful!
Camping sounds great.
I was looking into camping locations, but they seem scarce :P
Where would we camp?. By scarce, I mean, there are four near the Blacksburg area, but one is by a highway, another doesn't have any reviews, one has bad reviews, and the last is a private camp ground.. Thursday fun sounds awesome, but I'd like to know where we're camping-- unless it's only me camping.
Wow. That looks nice!. I think it would be especially nice with you.
I have not.. But upon a quick search, I can tell she was on SNL.
That sounds like so much fun. The part where I'm spending time with you.. I'll make sure it's okay for me to come.. Would I be leaving Thursday as well?
Okay. So Wednesday to Sunday!. Got it (:. What time on Wednesday is the best time for you?
Okay.. So 4:45pm!. Is there anything that I should get from your house that you need?. My mother thought you needed a food processor-- so she bought you one :P. I won't bring it unless you think you will use it.. Be sure to make a list.. Be right back.
I would not mind in the slightest.. I'll have to grab a sleeping bag from your house.. I'll ask first.. Make your list for me though.
Sounds good. You told me of your class on Friday-- so I was aware.. Yes. A list of things that you need for me to bring.. The food process is really small-- by the way. Between a third to a half of the one we had been using-- and it has more attachments.. It's okay if you still don't have room, but like I said. It's baby-sized.
It is :P
I'm sure that's not it :P
Okay. Should I go tonight while your mother is home?
Okay.
Okay.. I have a few things to take care of. I'll try to stay nearby though.. If you think of anything new, just let me know!
A skewer?. Let me know when your mother is ready for someone to invade :P
Me too. I'll head over then.
Anything else.. Any last minute revisions?
Which shorts?
Any in particular?
Okay.. How many sleeping bags from your house? 2? Or should I bring my own?. Bug Spray?. Which sandals?. I'm guessing the black and brown ones, but I need to know.. also need to know the swim suit you need.
Fishing poles?. I may or may not have them.. I remember seeing a pole-- but it might not be salvageable.. I'll head over to your mothers house now.
I'll be right back1
Sweet dreams to you too.. Sorry if I bored your ear.. I love you too. I can't wait to see you tomorrow.
Good morning!. I'm trying to accept your invitation, but it is not allowing me access to it. Also-- I cannot check in at 10am.
I don't think I have much "camping foods". We can get some while we're at the store though-- if you wanted.
Om nom!
Okay!. Can we stop by the Apple Store too?. I was going to buy a charger and it would be with me sooner if I bought it in person!. Not to say that my soldering and tinkering didn't work, but the Frankencharger is totally working (it's charging my laptop right now!)
Whoa, really?. It looked so official :P. I suppose after seeing an actual Apple Store, it did look a bit too much like a Best Buy :P
Tah tah for now.. What are you drinking at that restaurant? It looks really foamy.
So fancy!
I thought you got another Shirley Temple.. Because it was so red-- I was wrong, but I think it was a close guess.. Make a wish!
That's a mouse.
Just kidding.
I'm sorry, but I can't save you right now!. I wish I could!
I guess that means you don't need your Honorary Spider Catcher anymore.
Okay. I'll be sure to be on my "game".. I'm going to bring an extra sleeping bag just in case it's extra cold.. Is that okay?. Should I also bring a cooler?
Okay. The mat was dirty, so I've cleaned it-- It's drying in the sun.. I have the tent packed, and I'll pack the extra sleeping bags as well.. Should I bring paints? We could paint :P. I almost have everything ready. Let me know if there's any last minute ideas!. I forgot the charcoal at your house, but I can pick that up before I leave (and I'm saying it so I don't forget)
I have the first aid kit in my car.
Do you need band aids and/or a first aid kit for your house?. They always come in handy-- and you never have one when you need one :P. Oh, I mustn't forget water!
I will try!. Anything else?. I'll go pack the car with what I have so far.
Ice Cream Donuts.. It's where they fill the donut with ice cream-- kind of like mochi :P. Or.. Ice Cream Bill's, where the mascot is Bill and he's made of Strawberry Ice Cream.
Or Polar Junction.
Or Polar Bear Junction.. Just to add the Bear part.. Or anything ending in Shoppe or Station.. You could make your ice cream cones shaped like a Polar Molecule.. Like H2O.. That way it's also shaped like the head of a bear.. http://www.handsoccupied.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/teddybearicecream.jpg
But you need to use your own!. Otherwise you run into Copyright issues.
With ice cream!. :P
The free ice cream event would be helpful.
For making the bear.. Or that too.
That too again!. Here you go/. .*
Thanks! I made it for you (:
*blush*. Thanks :3
Okay!
Thank you for the invite! I loved spending time with you.. Let me know when you'd like more company!
I saw that drying your clothes on high heat for about an hour will help kill any ticks that you may have acquired (So check the clothes that you have). I'm a little worried that I brought some home.
I had one on me! So I became paranoid :P. Boop.
How are you?. !!! You're so cool!!!1. Okay...
Got that out of my system-- ah! So awesome!
I'm eating spaghetti.. I wasn't ready for it, but now I am.. I'm having some neck pain.. But I don't think I have many other symptoms.
Sweet dreams to you too!
I love you too, Leandra!!!. I'll be sure to inspect myself daily.
You should be on the lookout too-- you had one on you too.
It's crazy!. They're watching Murder She Wrote.
It's a tv show from the mid-eighties to mid-nineties.. They is Scott, Jessica, Molly, and Ana.. Katy is isolated in her room.
Sweet dreams to you too!. I know that "They is" sounds funny-- but I meant it as "'They' is", as I was defining it, but I think "They are" would be more appropriate in other circumstances.
I was just letting you know that I know how to "speak good"
Hello!. I don't think the share bus is going to stop in Charlottesville.
Well thanks!. I'm trying to find the best way to get transferred color from a white shirt :P
Oh, researching it online.. The UVA Game shirt has a pink splotch on the back.. So I was trying to find the best solution between clorox (color safe) and dye remover, or some people recommended mineral spirits.
http://www.howtocleanstuff.net/how-to-fix-dye-transfer/. Clorox is a type of bleach.. I suppose it's a white shirt though-- I just want to be safe.. I think it could be messed up because it's not "all white" though.. I'm going to walk home, because I don't have another class for 3 hours.. I'll talk to you when I get there, or you can call me if you have time.. Bye for now.
Maybe.. I think I found another shirt that was affected.. It may need to be soaked.
I think it's only the two shirts, which is good.. Or you know..  better than more than the two :P
I do not have accessed to the link.. Were you going to share with me the particular ride I needed to book?. Or was the link you sent me correct?
Okay!. I will book the travel then.. The bus I mean.
Yes.. The link you sent me before.. I need to book it to rsvp for Pennapps.
I don't think I have a card that has $110 on it though.. But it looks like I should be heading to my next class now.. So I'll figure it out afterwards.
I don't think my card is working.
I have reset the pin twice.. I can reset it a third time, but that takes a while-- and I think if that doesn't work, I'll need a new card.. Bye for now.
Thanks for adding me to the group!. I just recently got home.. How are you?
Sounds good!. I too will be working on homework.. I haven't yet booked the ride though.
And it will sound like "Wub wub wub wub wub"
Good luck!
I love you too!!. I saw camping mats on one of the sale sites.. If you ever wanted to go camping again :P. They're there.. I think I found the culprit of the transferred red! It's the sneaky red white and blue sweatband.. So sneaky! :P. TJZDDI. That's from the Sharethebus site.. It's a $10 off referral code.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
That's not a camping mat.
These are inflatable mats.. So they take up less room.. Self* inflatable.
Sweet apple pie dreams, Leandra!
Nighty night, Cutie Pie!. Good morning!
Good afternoon!. How are you?
Awesome!
I saw it!
Yeah!. Now I'll need a new google shirt.
Or that. :P
You too!. Does this mean I won't get to talk to you for the rest of the day?
I'll keep that in mind!. Boop!. Hello!
Hey, Cutie!!
No worries?. Oh. From the text message.. Hello!. Have you filled the Reimbursement form yet?
Are you going to print the form out?. Or just have it digital?. Don't forget to print your ticket!!!
Yes.. You need that.
Unless. Yes.. That.. I can't do that because I don't have a smart phone.. Anything I should bring for tomorrow?
But then I have to open my laptop and show it to them.
When I can just flash it to them.. Where is the recommended list again?
Oh I was hoping you had it.
Thanks!. I feel like I'm doing everything all at once, and I still need to drive to Blacksburg tonight.. Anything you'd like to see me wearing during PennApps?. I'm not sure if I want to shower with a bunch of other people.. (My laptop died before, by the way)
That's very kind of you!. I have other things to print though, so it's quite alright!
The waiver printed in the oddest way.. For some reason it didn't recognize some of the characters-- so some "t's" or "d's" are squares.. I think I have all of the homework gathered that I should require for the trip.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I'm going to drive home now.
But those are optional!. Someone might take that as "I won't wear them when I take a shower"
The link said that a bathing suit was optional, but if someone doesn't bring one, they can still take a shower without them.. It's actually very common for those showers to be full of males san-trunks.. sans*. But I do have swimming trunks packed anyway.. I just need to remember a towel, a sleeping bag (if we're still doing that) and a pillow.
I have.. They had them at the middle school.. I didn't use them though :P. I pulled a sleeping bag out, so just need the towel and pillow!. I've made sure to check the list several times.. Just in case I forget something, which I likely will.. Will you need an HDMI cable?
Anything you do need?. Snacks?. I can pack sandwiches.
They probably are.
Okay!.. Unfortunately, we are lacking in the "Natural" kind of peanut butter (I took it to Radford). So it's the unnatural kind and strawberry jam sandwiches, if you'd like that.
Wow!. That's so nice of you!!! (:. Well I need to be awake in 6ish hours, so I will say goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra!. I love you.
I love you so much!
Remember.. if you need to nap and be fully rested on the way there.... I know a shoulder that would be happy to see you.
I'll see you then!. I hope I find the Southgate Parking lot.. Good morning!
http://jsfiddle.net/LJfJF/132/#&togetherjs=FNT1gNql5J. Good morning.
How are you?. Hello.
I wish I could say yes, but unfortunately, no.
I'm doing homework in Young hall, but I can step out for a moment.
My later class is from 6:30 to 8:45.
You would be free afterwards?
Okay.. Anything you want to chat about now?
I slept.. For some reason I thought my 1pm class was at 1:30pm.. So I was late, and that made me sad.
It's okay.. How was your day?
Sounds awesome.. I want to finish all of the homework too.
Sounds good!. I need to take a day where I do all of the homework just to get ahead.
Friday sounds like a good day to do it.
I don't have any gears.
I was going to check Heavener's, but my brother said it would be unlikely to be found at Home Depot or Lowe. 's*
The due date is a mystery, so I better get it done sooner than later.. The refurbish store near Cafe 88 would be a cool place to check.. The next time I'm in Charlottesville.
Which also makes me think of the Humanity Restore.
I may check the Restore on a Tuesday/Thursday day or on Friday.. I think that'll be a good place to check.. 3d printing would be cool too-- but I'd want to make the entire assembly out of it :P. I'm going to head into the classroom now.. Bye for now.
Sweet dreams. I hope you get plenty of sleep.
That's good.
Good morning.
How are you?
I'm alright.. I hope you have a nice day today.. I just finished the drawings I needed for class.
I kind of rushed through them, but I think it'll be okay.
I'd think they look good enough for class :P. They were "tutorial" type things.
I think you can, but I think I did enough to show I am capable and enough to show that I followed the tutorials (they're actually "how to" videos)
We will see.. I called Habitat for Humanity ReStore and asked if they had clocks and/or gears, and they said no.
Wow. That would be really nice of you.
I'll get them together.. Is Maya good to use?
Of course.
That's good!
I have no classes on Friday, so I am free the whole day.. So that would be a yes.
No problem.. Falling Branch is in Roanoke?. Christiansburg!. Okay, that's great.
Roanoke would have been fine too.
It's not a problem.
Sounds good.
No need to thank me!. It's not an issue!. I'm going to step out for a bit, but I'll be back.
Awesome.. I'll be doing that after my 3:30pm class.
I'm not a fan of many of the gears that I've been seeing on thingiverse.
I found some on ebay, they're only about 4 or so dollars, but you only get one of each.
Hello.
Oh!. Have a good time.. I'll be working on animations.
I'm glad that you think so.
Well I was actually working on my seed packages.. But I should probably get to the animation as well.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I'll do the animation in the morning.. I'm feeling tired.
Mhmm.
Goodnight.. Hello.
That's today.. Happy Wednesday.
I hope your day is going well too.. Goodnight.
I can call you around then if I am.. The rest of my day will likely consist of homework and possibly more homework.
That's my homework.
Maybe a little bit.. You're designing too!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I hope your day was great and I hope it will be just as great tomorrow.
I hope yours is so spectacular that you are blinded by the radiance!. Just kidding, that would be bad.. G'night!. Can you open .svg in autocad?
Thanks. I realized that I too could have done that.. But thank you!. Goodnight, Lovely.. I mean, Leandra!
Good morning.
I hope your Thursday is nice.. It won't be too long before I can make your Friday night nice.. My glasses were in one of my smaller pockets. Now I feel silly.. You must have said that by habit if you had to apologize.
I didn't know you shouldn't have.. It's okay if you say it next time.
But only if you want to.
What are you up to?
I'm finishing the prototype.. After I eat dinner I'll probably work on my seed packets.
Mhmm.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Have a nice day tomorrow.
I'm excited to see you too.. There's a movie called "The Great Polar Bear Adventure" and I think you would like it based off the title alone, but if that doesn't do it for you, then the movie cover has like four or so polar bears on it.
Already has you hooked!. I'm not sure how good it actually is though.. But you could always watch it as "background video".
Thank you (:. Boop!
Hi!
How's it going>. ?*. I think for the most part I have all of my thumbnails done.
I'm alright.. I still have a bunch more homework that's due for Monday, but getting the stuff done for Sunday this early is making me feel like I can finish most of it.
Definitely!
Hey, I really really like you too!. I had to drive to campus to submit my files :P. But once that's done, I'll be home and I'll homework it up!
It was working fine for facebook, or for my email, but it could not upload the files.. It took a few hours.
I miss you too!. I'm ready to hang out whenever!. We can do homework!!. And cuddle.
I need to use one of my Saturdays to complete the driver improvement program.. But I have no plans for this weekend.
It is due before the review date, which is a year since the court date.. The court date was in June, so it would have to be before June 2016.
I'm going to drive back home now.. Everything is submitted, and now I just gotta chug through the seed packets.. If I have time after that I'll start my animation chapters 1-3.
You too, Cutie!
Good luck!. I aim to sleep when I finish my seed packets at the very least.. Bye for now.. I'll be around in five or so minutes.. (when I'm home)
I'll do that when I get home!
I'll be sure to adjust the levels.. And make them nice!
I got this, don't you worry!
Okay.
This was a good picture of you!. Anyway, I'll get home and take care of your business photos.. Bye for now!. Cutie Pie! ^~^
They are large files, if that's okay.
My email can't handle it-- I have to use Google Drive.. DSC_0350 is a little dark, but I'll send it to you anyway!
I should have done this while I was on campus.. But I didn't have the pictures with me, so such is life :P
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207522240083351&set=a.10207522238723317.1073741826.1509734112&type=3&theater. These are unedited-- the edited ones are taking a bit of time, but I made an album (only visible to you) on facebook. You can download the ones you like!
The ones I liked are the "better ones"
I only shared them with you.
It's closed to "Close Friends" and you are the only person in that group.. I saved it so that only you can see them now-- just in case "Close Friends" changes :P
No problem!. I just wish the adjusted ones would load.
You're amazing!!. I love you!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I left the protective sleeve to my digital tablet at your house-- could you tell your mother so that she doesn't throw it away?
I just sent you the fixed photos.
Good morning!
You too!. Good luck on your interview today! (Not that you need it! ^~^)
Oh man!. You sounded so anxious, so I thought it was sooner than that.
Hello!
Well my walking home will probably be around 8:20-30
But it might just align!. Hello.. Keep up the good work!. I love you!
I received a 14/15 on my technical assignment for including too many photos.. I was feeling bummed about that.. Anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams.. I'm messing up on everything. :/
Good morning.. The sleeve to my tablet was actually folded with my clothes, so scratch that on it being at your house.. I had assumed it was, because it wasn't on my tablet, but I shouldn't have assumed.
Okay, thanks!. You're awesome!!!. I can't wait to see you again ^~^
Really?. That would be awesome!
Definitely!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
If you see this, could you give me a wake up call at 7:45?. I have an arsenal of alarms, but I want to be safe.
That is slightly after :P
Good morning!. Hello!
Hey, Cutie!. GOodnight and sweet dreams!
I love you!
^~^. Are you super sleepy?. Did you get everything done??. How was the Meat and Greet?. There's a new video out of Chase and Michael from Zoey 101.. Just thought you might want to know.
I thought so too!. You're sososososo cool!. Hi.
Thanks.. Sweet dreams to you too.
We'll see.. Hello.. Boop!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgv0Z8Q2OIQ
I thought you'd like it!. I love you!!! (:
Thanks for being awesome!. !!!!!!!111!
Well I know how you like sweet things.
Sorry.
:4. That kind of looks like a cone nosed face, but it was supposed to be ":$". Goodnight and sweet dreams, Cutie Pie!. You look nice in the turquoise dress you're wearing in the picture with your small group.
I think you're gorgeous-- just to let you know.. I love you. Goodnight.
Sweet dreams!
Good morning!
That was supposed to be breakfast, but sometimes people eat chips and salsa for breakfast :P
Oh, I suppose you eat chips and salsa for breakfast!
That's a neat "Leandra Fact" that I'll have to keep in my pocket!
Oh how the cookie crumbles.. (that's: "Oh how the truth comes out" but I'm also just kidding.)
Did I now?!. You must be eating salsa right now then!. A spicy start to the day.
That's awesome!. Extra food is always cool!. I hope you have an awesome day!. But it sounds like you will since you have extra food!!
Wow~. That'll be great for you!. You're always saying: "I wish I had more vegetables.". Looks like your wish came true! :P. I love you.
(hug)(hug)
How has your day been?
It's been okay. My teacher said that my design wasn't strong enough.. And that it was too safe.. So I've got a bit more work to do.. I may need help breaking out of the safe.
In my packaging class. I focused on the actual package/structure, than I should have.. I think having a second pair of eyes looking at my designs would be helpful, but I don't need you to supply the eyes.
That's very kind of you!. I'm designing packaging for Five Guys, but none of my designs are good.. I hope my headache goes away. I'm worried that I'll get sick, because of all of the sick people in my classes.
That's okay. I just started to miss you.. I hope so too, but it's not that bad, so I can work through it.
Too much?
Goodnight and sweet dreams! (If you're going to sleep!). (I'll stop with the stickers... for now!)
Oh-- I have to make new designs.. Which will take a bit more time than right now.
I love you so so so so much!!1
You're amazing and wonderful!
So much so!
Sounds like a cliffhanger!. I'm looking forward to it too!. If you need to be picked up anywhere, just let me know!
Anything you need, you name it!
(hug)(hug). You can have plenty of those (if you want them). I could also have a few cuddles available, but it'll depend on when you redeem them.. (Just kidding). You can have them at any time.
Sweet dreams, Leandra!!1. Good morning!
I love you!
:3. I hope that you have a great day today.
Wow!. It's barely started!!. I'll think about you throughout my day!. I love you!
Tah tah for now, Cutie!
I love you, Leandra! I hope the next half of your day is even more awesome than the first!!1
^~^. ^-^ *
I hope yours is too!. People are swimming in the puddles outside!. The Iron Giant has been remastered, and it's going to feature two new scenes!. It'll be at the Regal Cinema tomorrow and Sunday!
It's flooding enough that the puddles are small bodies of water.. I hope your day was really nice!
If you plan to sleep, goodnight and sweet dreams!
Good luck!!. Not that you need it!!1
Of course!. I love you! Sleep tight!
Oh no! Why?. Pick it up!
It might break!. Is it a class for your major?
That makes sense.. I support your decision, even though it doesn't affect me.. (but it affects your happiness, which affects me)
I hope so!. You + Peter == Happy?. (I don't hope that lab reports make you sad, just that I hope you will be much happier.)
Which is true?. That less lab reports == happy Leandra??
Oh! That's good!
Leandra makes me happy too!. Sleep tight!
(hug)
(hug)(hug). Sorry.
I'm not so great.. Goodnight.. (I was waiting for you to hug back)
Good morning-evening-night.
Sweet dreams.. Good morning.
I hope you have a nice day.
It's me :P. How are you?
I'm okay.. I'm working on "microthemes" for my History class.
We have a term paper and a creative project that we need to write proposals for which essentially explain our thesis and plan of action.. And we had an article to read, in about the evolution of reading, which I have to write a few paragraphs about.
I should still be hear when you return.
Hello.. I'm still writing away.. We had to read the article by candlelight, in a noisy environment, and in a comfortable environment.
I think so, the article was also an introduction to reading.
And I have to write about it, then my teacher will have to read what I wrote!
Then when they grade me... I'll be reading what they came up with based on my reading from reading about reading.. That's just me being silly.
I like you too.. Now I need to describe the mechanism I created for the spineless volume.
I'm not entirely certain how to begin.. I know what the mechanism is and how it works, but I don't know how to put it to paper.
It's so difficult, because it should be written well.. But right now I'm just listing things.
I don't think it's cool.. I don't have much time left to write it.
Don't be sorry.. It's okay.. I'm just worried that it's not concise enough.
Yes.. I'm done for the day. Time for homework!
Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I hope you had a nice day.
Sweet dreams@. I love you.
You're incredible.
I think so, so much so.
The New River Valley is supposed to flood this weekend.. It might not be safe to travel.
I hope you're safe!. And just remember.. if you're ever feeling cold, I have a set of arms that can warm you up.
Any time-- just let me know.. I'll be ready!
Good morning, you!. It's alright out here!. If you're wondering weather wise, I haven't been outside to see.. It'll be in the lower to mid fifties today with a 50% chance of rain all day. You better dress accordingly!. Now back to Susan with the news.. Thanks Brian. Have you ever seen a hamster cat? Researchers in Finland have found just that!. Now to Ken with the sports.
And to Leandra with the cuteness report!
You heard it here, folks.
I hope your day is going nicely.
Thanks.. Just working!. Trying to free things up so I can spend time with you.
I would not mind.. Whoops-- I already did that :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams for later.
I do not have any plans for tomorrow-- just so you are aware.. I bet there have been quite a few Modern Family's that have accumulated for you and your mother to watch :P
I bet that'll be fun.. Or just spending time with your mom-- that's probably better.. But you were likely planning on that anyway.. Good morning.
I hope you slept well.
Have a nice day, I suppose.
Thanks.. Would you like to spend time with me/do homework today?
We could go to the Library, or somewhere quiet.. I need a place with a big enough table to work though.. Are there any places you think you would like to work?
I can work on the floor too.. Or a small table :P. Which home? Mine or yours?
If you'd like, I can arrive around 1:30.. Or later, depending on when you could be ready.
Oh.. That's okay then.
I guess that's a "no" to homework?
:/. Okay.. If you ever want to see me, then let me know.
You don't have to, of course. I'm not much to see.
Not true, but thanks.. I am available whenever.
I love you too.. I found a guitar pick that I thought you could have.
It's just a guitar pick.. Would you like to watch cartoons with me?
When and where?. You can come over, but I'd understand you wanting to stay with home.. I am ready right now, so the time doesn't matter.. I also have a toblerone that we can share.
Okay. It doesn't have to happen right away.. If you wanted to go to Squires, we could invade the Multicultural Room and I can load the shows on my laptop. They are, however, saved on my DVR.. I've been trying to find reasons for you to spend time with me, but they all seem to be failing.. I'll stop. Have a great day.
It's okay.. Have a nice weekend.. Did you know that there's a "National Girlfriend Day". ?*. It was August 1st. I'm sorry for missing it.
You probably haven't yet.
But you might.
You seem fairly busy though.
I don't have to distract you then.
Can I stop by at 3:45?
(hug)
(hug)(hug)
(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug). Class is almost over.
I too have homework to do!. So I'm on the same boat.. But I can always come tomorrow like we planned.
I believe in you!. I'll be sure to get all of my work done too.. Or most of it!. I really want to spend the little bit of time with you.
But at 2:30 I should be heading back, so expect me at 3!. That doesn't give a whole lot of time, but it's better than none!
Of course! I could even come over now, if you wanted.. I just have class at 10:30 in the morning.
I'll see you tomorrow!
To see you tomorrow?. You'll already be there!
You can come! It's only one class then a meeting with my teacher.. I can come get you :P
Any time that you like!. You could even come now :P. I have a sleeping bag and you can take the bed.
Of course! That's fine too.. My class starts at 10:30, and I usually leave the house around 10:00 to go to it.. It's a small class, so I'd understand if you wouldn't want to go inside the room, but there's plenty of places to do homework and the likes.. Would you rather me pick you up in the morning? Then take you home afterwards?
There likely won't be!. So picking you up would be best!. Especially since I'd be heading to your house afterwards to spend more time with you anyway.
So what time would you like to get picked up?. 9:20 or so?
Okay! Perfect!. (like you.)
Of course, you!. :3. You are my love, and though you may not see your perfection, I do every day.
I'm so in love, that you hit me with a love arrow.
And since you're in archery, I'm pretty sure you were aiming for my heart all along!
I love you!
The note you left me was very sweet!
No, but the words on the note melted my heart!
Did you want to use Illustrator to make it?
You can!
Mhmm!
Okay!. Sweet dreams, Cutie!. Sorry.. I'm not supposed to be calling you that.. See you in the morning!
8:30, like you said.
Sounds delightful.
You're awesome!
I love you too!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Wow! A whale!!
Good morning!. Hello.
I love you too!. How has your day been so far?. Make a wish!
I too am doing homework. I need to finish this painting pretty soon! o.o
And you've got this *points to self*
What about your group?. They may want to see it ahead of time.
Oops!. I sent it anyway.. What an accident.
I'm just Peter.. (hug)(hug)
I think you're pretty great yourself.
I don't have an easel!. I'm not sure what I'll do to paint.
We'll see!
I'll try!. I'll paint it tonight since I only have 30 minutes.. I'll get everything else done so that I only have it to work on later.
So yay!. :P
I love you too!
Heheh!. It's true!
*tackled*. *explosion*
Whoa!. You diffused the explosion!
Skillz is right.. My sailing is mostly smooth.. How is your time out at sea?
That's great!. Sorry I missed your call!!!
I was painting.. I love you too!. Hey, there.
How's the day going?
Painting and meeting famous authors.. That's about it though.
It's kind of enjoyable.. I should change pants before I start though.. And I only have 20 minutes to paint :P
Okay!. Boop1. Boop!
I sent it to Cody.. I wanted both of you to see the progress report (because he's interested in The Things They Carried.)
I apologize for doing so!. That's my progress for the night.. I've got my other homework to do now.. (I'm going to my friends house to work on it)
I'll send it separately next time!. You are sweet!
You're so sweet that doctors recommend you in small dosages to prevent heart attacks!
It's okay. A lot of people don't listen to their doctors.. I already have you in small doses :(. I love you, Leandra!
Good morning!
Not enough!!
I think you are wondeful!. wonderful*. Or wunderbar, as the Germans say.
You must like chocolate!
That's awesome!!. And so are you!
You are the one who puts the star on the top of the tree. Without you, the tree doesn't shine.. So you're the true star!
(:. You're the best teammate!. Paint paint!
Don't have to hope, Cutie! :D. Oh wait!. Sinister Sun!
Time to take a break from painting!. (for real this time, because just as I said that, I kept painting.)
I can read most Spanish :P. So I knew what you meant.. Sweet dreams to you too!
(hug)(hug)(abrazo)
Beso?. You're silly!
Good morning! I love you too!!!!
I hope you do as well!
You're awesome!. I feel like each time I put new paint onto my painting, I mess it up.
It doesn't look the way I want it to, so it doesn't.. I tried fixing it from the critique we had, but I lost some of the parts that I liked and it's not so great.. I'm going to have to wait for it to dry and mess with it later.. I had this this morning.. I wanted something like this:. This is what I have now:
Part of what I wanted is there, but part of it is gone as well.
I'll try to brace myself!
I better!. I love you!
I had an interesting day.. It consisted of painting, and then an interesting dinner with interesting people.
I'd rather not :P
They're not the kind of interesting that I can repeat in polite conversation.
I just can't repeat what they said :P
Gap invited me.
But can't they?. Just kidding.
They were just very honest.
How does this look?
What do you think I need to do with it?
I would keep painting it until it was good enough to be in a gallery.
What does that mean?
But there's so much more that I can fix.
Okay. I'll ask someone else then.
No. I see the problems. I just don't know how to go about fixing them.
Well.. I feel like the painting is heavy on the left side.. I also don't think the leaves are as detailed as my teacher would have liked.. And I think the fog removes too much, but I. I'm not sure how to put the detail back in and keep the fog*
Maybe I just need to add more reds and yellows.. It's leaning too much in the green territory.
I know.
Because I'm not satisfied.
I guess I know of areas around the arms and the guns that actually need to be fixed (I need a more definitive edge)
I won't touch it now.
But it's still not my "vision". (hug)(hug). Sometimes I worry that you could be up to no good behind my back.. You would tell me, right?
Did you mean to say "up to good"?. The words start with a "c" or an "s". I trust you, but sometimes I worry that you could find someone else and not tell me.
For love and companionship.
What about when you met me?. Were you looking for someone then?
Then you never know.
Well that's all you had to say then!
Who are you going to vote for this Presidential election?. (I picked that cat, because it was the most cat like and I wanted to fit in with your ":3")
I've heard people saying good things about Bernie Sanders, but I haven't done enough research to know if he'd make a good choice.
He's a Democrat.. That's about all I know.. You should get some sleep, Leandra!. Goodnight and sweet dreams, Cutie!
I love you lots too!!!!
It's blushing!. (like me). (because of you)
Good morning!
It totally is!!. I don't have any to nom, but if you find any.. you know what to do!
Yes he is.. An old guy who probably likes doughnuts!
Wow. Sounds like some swell ideas.
I hope you have an amazing fantastic awesome day too!!1. I was temporarily fixing my gameboy. I'm using it for a "scanner project" for Photography.
I think so too.. My scanner needs to be heavily cleaned though.. I tried cleaning it before, but I just made things worse!
Oh I have access to scanners. I just don't have anything to store my gameboy in to keep it from getting damaged.. And I have more freedom using the scanner I have.. Hey, Cutie!
I know that I don't.
"I know that I don't have the wrong person.". Meaning I have the right person.
Hey, there!
!!! You! :3. I missed your call at 5! :(. Now I've lost you forever.
Good!. I was worried, but now I've got you forever!
I love you!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
And you are wonderfully sweet!
Sweet dreams (:. You could say that I have the same feelings towards you.
An even more mischievous sun!. And yes! That's the perfect one of you tackling me!
That one comes right before you tackling me.
It could be a story of how lost I am without you, but you're just hiding behind a wall ready to strike.
How soon???
Do not fear!. There is always hope!
Sleep tight, Leandra!!! And sweet dreams!
Your one and only.. Goodnight!
I love you, Leandra!!
I hope you are too!
The reception is tonight!. I messed up on my book cover, but it shouldn't be too noticeable from a distance.
Not your spirits!!. That's spooky!
I can try to find a job in Charlottesville.. Then you could see me all the time.
That's scary. How do you get the job experience if you were in College all that time.
So I need to work for Pixar/Disney?
I hear that people work at Disney for as little as possible, because they work the employees to death.
Definitely.
Aww man.. I was really looking forward to seeing you in person.
I unfortunately have a bunch due on Sunday.. And then a project due Monday.
If you wanted to visit, I would welcome you with open arms.
I just don't think I could visit you, because it's a lot of driving that I could be using for homework.
Awesoem!. awesome*
Just makes me feel nervous.
Tombo! (:. I wanted to do that too!! :D. I'll be on the lookout for a costume!. 1955. oops! :P
Just in time for Back to the Future!!!
You're awesome!!! (:. Tombo shouldn't be a hard costume!! (:. I just need to find a red and white striped shirt.. Maybe a yellow jacket, and I'm set!
You're so so so cool!!. This is my final book cover.. I can always fix the issues that it currently has, but they're fairly minor!. By that I mean the physical issues.. Wow! An Item sold on Ebay!. I better go to Blacksburg and take care of that!. (It sold yesterday, so I'm too late to deliver it on time)
Yeah! I'll get it ready to ship tonight, then drop it off tomorrow morning!. Looks like we can add some money to the adventure fund!. Anyway, the reception is at 5pm, so I better head over there!. Can't keep my fans waiting.. (Just my parents)
You too, Lovely!@. Tah tah for now.
Cutie! :3
!!!!!1
Thanks (:. Hey, there!. How has your day been?
My day was full of adventure and things!. I cut my thumb on an aluminum can though.
I was about to wash some bottles, but sure!. You're so cool!
Oh, I'm just some guy..
If you think so!. Hi!. Do you think you could help me locate a menu with Entrees, Lunch, Dinner, Specials, Appetizers, Soups, Salads, Beverages, Bar, Sides, and Dessert?
I found one.. Thanks though!. I'm late though :/. And the drop box is closed.. Hello there!
I love you!. Good morning!!!. I hope you slept well!
I was so warm because of my space heater.. I probably have to turn it down a few notches.
It was nice though. I had some silly dreams :P
It's too silly!. But I think there was a part where this family set up paintings by a Middle Eastern Dictator.. Which was just weird.
You're interesting!!!
I need you to be on the receiving end!
!!! Awesome (:. How is your day so far?. My brother has a bottle capper!!. Which is awesome.
It will help a bunch when I mock up the bottles.. Wow!. Ice skating!!. That's so cool :D
I bet!
I'm excited for you!!!
You excite me.. I guess if I have to be excited for something else... then I'm not sure what to be excited for.
I'm not sure.. I'm not up to much other than homework.
But homework, Leandra!
I'll try.
(hug)
(hug)(hug)(hug)
Thanks!
Tah tah for now, Cutie Pie!. (It's just root beer)
So you're saying that in order to be attractive, you can't wear glasses?. Well I never!
And wiser?. Because that's what I was going for :P
(hug)(hug). (hug)(hug)(hug). Wow! Did you go camping again>. ?*. Must be fun!. Hello!. (hug)
I did not receive that message!. That sounds like fun!!!
Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Hello!
Hello.. (hug). I hope your day has been nice!
I could have gone to Jo Ann Fabrics and gotten you ribbon!. I can always go there again!. (hug)
Awesome!. (hug)
I love you, Cutie!
(I'm not really a dragon)
Phew.. I thought I might have given off that "vibe".
That's good!. Boop!
Hello!
I am folding clothes and making my bed ready for you.
I said "I can do something in Blacksburg.". As long as there are some sort of festivities or decorations to take pictures of.
Mhmm!
You're neat!. Do you still think you'll arrive at 11:15?
Wow!. The warms must be amazing!
I can't wait to see you!
It's exciting!. Hello!. (hug)
I'm "finished"
They're not very good.
Thank you!. I plan to sleep now and until 3 or so, then I plan to work until I can't work no more!
Good morning!. I took the sleep anyway!
I'm glad you did too!. Hello!
: 3. (hug)
Om nom!
I got Chicken Breast on 9-grain wheat with Swiss cheese and then all the veggies.
Indeed!
Well if it's anything like the start, I will not :P
It's not too bad-- but that's just how it begins!. I was taking apart the clock movements and the spring exploded and I died. The end.
Just on my finger.. It was cut off!. Just kidding..
But it's bleeding quite a bit-- I might need... TWO bandaids!
Eep!. I've been squished!
I love you too!
You bit me!. In the bottom!
Is that really something you can do nicely?
Maybe.... But I'll keep my suspicious face!. They actually have a selection of suspicious faces-- and this was the least weird one!. (It's still a little weird)
My next packaging project involves designing for Lipton Tea!. Sounds neat, huh?
Yep.. I just gotta make a fancy new looking logo.
Maybe!. I'm making like-- 136 tea packets.. You can drink them all! :P
I don't have access to a laser cutter.
When should I visit? During Thanksgiving Break?. I think I get out before you do.
I think I'm out the entire week.
11/21-11/29. How would it line up assuming I have my designs already printed?
So I should have at least 1-2 prints devoted for tests?
Tea bags are fairly small-- so I should be able to have many on one sheet.
Especially if I'm only designing the little tag on the end of the bag.
But we'll see once I'm actually at the design phase-- right now I'm doing research.
I can print on 12x18.
(hug)(hug). I love you!
What would you like to see on fancy tea?. Maybe ships??. With sea monsters??!?!
So each have a different sea monster?
They'll be tea monsters :P
Maybe... Hmm... I'm going to drink this water, then I'm heading right to class.
Thanks.. I worry that I did not do well on the upcoming assignment.. I'll have to do a better job for the more important assignment.. I also need to purchase paper-- but I forget to every day :P
Photo paper*. I get mine from the school printers too though!. We have so much in common!. :3. Bye for now.
(hug)
I love you too!
You're really cool!
I can supply them!. When do you need it by???
(hug)(hug)
I would like to give you one as soon as possible too!
That's so soon!!!
Not soon enough :P. But I can wait.
(hug). Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I love you, Leandra!. (hug)
You sleep tight too!. I'll tuck you into a burrito!
Night night!. (hug) (hug). My poor laptop battery is on its last leg.. Good morning!
No, it just notified me to replace it soon.
But I told it that we've been through so much!
Yeah! I can't just give up on my battery!. (hug). The repair and service coverage has expired.
I feel like it just recently expired, because it was to expire in 3 years-- the same time my battery decides it's old!. I call sabotage!!!
I should have been more vigilante
(hug)(hug) I love you so so so  much too!!!!
Sounds great!
My day is going alright. How is yours?
That's really good!
Yay!
!!!. I don't want to miss that!!
(hug)
I love you!
(hug). Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Wow! You're the super-est!. And super cute!. I'm just here drawing logos and letters though.
I can show you what I have so far!
There you go!
I sent it via picture message.
Oh no!. The first one is the one I spent more time on! :O
It's just Fall with style!
:P. Good morning!
Lucky!
And because cake for breakfast!
You seemed pretty excited :P. But I'll keep that in mind for when I see you next.
Delicious healthy cake then?
I'll try and make you healthy cake then!
I just need a place to stay :P
That's fine.
Unless we take an automatic :P
There are several at my house.
That sounds great!. I can also try to learn stick shift.
I have people that can try as well :P
(hug). So you really preferred the second logo?
Oh. I can see if I can fix that.. I love you!. I hope your day has been going really well!
(hug). Phew.. drawing all day really takes it out of you!
You're good!. I love you!. Just ask if you need anything designed!
Of course!. Anything for you!. (I'm here for you)
That'll be you when you stay up for always!
Aww :3. Again-- I am happy to help with any designing.
(hug)(hug)
It would be if I were with you!
I'm sorry :/
Did you know that if you get Pho from Cafe Mekong to go they'll give you raw beef that cooks in your soup?
I was concerned :P. Mostly because the baggy was open and blood leaked all over the food.
But it was okay. Now I have a cat squishing me.
It's all like "I'm going to lay on your limbs!"
Sure!. I'd love that!!1
You dazzle me :3
Don't be a stranger!. You're free to stay over as much as you like!
I'm pretty qualified, but I can get my credentials together.
Okay-- as long as you interfere a little!. I'll be there for hugs.. I'm being surrounded by cats o.o
This is what happens when you go home to Blacksburg for a weekend.. It's like they know when you're busy/trying to eat!
I definitely want you to interfere with me!
Definitely the thing to look forward to!
I love you so so so so much too!. How's the coding? Am I needed yet?. I really want to design a video game :P. But I'm ready for anything!
Do you have a team?. I know it'll be hard to find a better teammate than yours truly, but I have faith in you that you'll find someone who can almost live up to me.
Definitely!. You've gotta go to one of the team building seminars!
Is there anyone from your bus looking for teammates?
I'm sure if they have a facebook page you can post that you are looking for teammates.. I can be your teammate from afar.. If all else fails.
Sweet dreams at 11!. I won't distract you too much!. I know you've got an idea inside you that's waiting to be released!
I'm here for you though!
Of course!. Sleep tight (or as best as you can!)
Okay!. Good luck!. You can always use me as a pillow/bed!
Whenever you're in town!. Just make an appointment.. The list is usually packed, but I'm sure I could squeeze you in.. Who am I kidding-- I haven't had a customer in weeks! (Since the last time you were here)
Since you first decided to nap on me.. I've been getting regular business ever since.
Yes!. I'm ready to be used!. (And yes-- from you! You're my best and only customer)
What kind of design would you like?. Do you need it now?. Or should I sleep and do it in the morning?. What time will you be waking up?
Okay!. When is the deadline!. I also need guidelines for what you want me to design.. (Maybe the details for the project you've settled on)
What time will you need it by?
What exactly are you looking for?. This one is probably too much.
!!!!!!!. Om nom!
That's okay-- I really don't know what color goes with "Newspaper gray". But then again-- a newspaper is the first place I went with the idea.
You're not very forward with what you want.. But that doesn't make you bad :P
You want both serif and sans-serif?
What you want sounds very simple-- but it's okay!
So you want a symbol to go with the text logo?
So it could be "MeowNews?"?
I'll see what I can do.
Sorry if I'm late.
Sorry-- I didn't get to a cat/light bulb/lightbulb-cat
Wow! You found a teammate??. That's cool!
I gave you a png.. with a transparent background.. But maybe not through facebook.. I think facebook may have changed it.
I emailed it to you-- if that's okay.. This is just in case!
(hug)(hug). I love you too, Cutie Pie!. (hug)(hug)(hug). I can't wait to see you!
I hope it's soon!. How did hacking go?. (hug)
Yeah! I didn't know this sticker set existed in conjunction with the other!. So how'd things go?
That's good!. Win anything?. (Other than my heart?)
That's good!. Sorry-- you were typing.
Oh!.. I thought you were going to tell of your adventures.. Also-- would you like to make a game with me?. I think it'd be really neat!
!!!. I like storytelling games like rpg's. I also think that pixel art would be relatively easy to make.
Is that so?. What other kind of game could we make?
I think learning can be part of it-- but I just want it to be fun/entertaining.. Something with references people can appreciate.
Are you "game"?
That's awesome of you.
I see.. I'll see what I can do!
(hug)
I'm alright!. Worried about tomorrow-- but I'm okay.. How are you?. I love you so so so much!
I just have a few things due tomorrow.. And I don't really know how to take these clock movements apart.
My finger still kind of hurts from before, so using my hands hasn't been something that I've been doing.. I suppose that shouldn't stop me though.
It's okay!
You're back!. You breathe new life into me
I miss you!
I love you too!. (hug). You can call me if you walk home in the dark!
That's good then!. (hug). Hello!
How are you on this fine rainy day? (unless it's not raining)
Awesome! (:. You're so cool!. I love you!. The Tim O'Brien talk is going to be this Saturday.. You can get free tickets.. http://www.eventbrite.com/e/tim-obrien-the-things-they-carry-big-read-nrv-tickets-18980919441. (In case you're interested)
I already have my ticket!
I wish I could say I did more-- but I got a few photographs done.
I'm just me.. I need to crank out some good ideas for Lipton Tea.. Does tea make you feel any particular way?. That I can design from?. I was thinking about taking pictures of faces and there would be the particular flavor in the hair of the person.. I just need 6 people.. Maybe-- nine people!. To represent the 9 muses.. That might be cool.. Boop!
From Greek mythology.. Because tea could "inspire" people-- or something.
Calliope.. There are 9 :P. Calipso is someone else.
Calipso is also Greek.. She's from the Odyssey.
She's a nymph-- but I suppose I never considered that venue.. Oh-- but you're right-- she's from Pirates of the Caribbean.. But from the Odyssey first.
Mhmm!. Tea Nymphs could be an idea :P
No?. Bad idea?
What's wrong with the idea?
They would be girls in togas :P. With the flavor of the beverage in their hair.. Because some were flowers-- it wouldn't necessarily work for all of them though.
I don't know why you don't like it though-- you can't just say you don't like it without explaining it.
Why?
If I were to do the 9 muses, those are also only female.. And to create brand recognition, keeping the characters on the packaging relate as closely as possible keeps them from looking too different.
The majority of tea drinkers are female.. But the majority of females do not buy gender specific designs.. But I was going for a Greek look-- regardless of gender.. I shouldn't limit myself to only Greece, of course-- but I haven't come up with other ideas.
There are two types of Earl Grey.
And unfortunately, there is no peppermint.. o.o. Cute animals is an idea though.. Bears and owls might be nice in conjunction.
I just have to make the design say "high end tea". boop boop. How has your day been?. (hug). (hug)(hug). (hug)(hug)(hug). I'm going to keep doing this until you hug back.. (hug)(hug)(hug)(hug). (hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug). (hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)
Phew.. finally!
I love you too!. I just removed all of the pictures from my camera-- but somehow it doesn't accept that I did o.o. It got full after a few photos.
Maybe they aren't "deleted"
Dun!. I should have been formatting the card, instead of deleting the photos, because the information remains in some way on the card.
It says I have 650+ now.. So that's good.
I took a nice photo of a model ship.. But I haven't taken much else worth noting.
I hope so!. The lighting is very dynamic.. Thank you, Cutie Pie!! (:. Boop!
Hello!!. How are you?
I am tired.
(hug)(hug). Hello!. Good morning!
Are you 30 minutes away?
Where is the drop off point?
Okay-- I may have to stop to get gas, but hopefully you'll know when you're there :P. Be sure to text me!
I'll move on then!. I'll be out and about (so texting/calling will be the only way to reach me.). Hopefully the fuel center is still open!
That sounds good.. That way you'll stay warm.. See you there!
Bye! :3. Leandra?
The car is not starting. So unfortunately that leaves you with two options. You can either take a ride from one of my parents over here or you stay with your mother in Blacksburg.. And since I know you don't want to bother anyone, then that leaves you with only the one option.
That's fine.. I'll try to get the car started, but I don't see it working any time soon.. I'm sorry.
Okay. The Tim O'Brien lecture is at 7pm tomorrow.. I'll see you then.
I am not optimistic about it.
I suppose you could always drive out-- but I don't want to impose.
There should be.. By that I mean yes.
That's fine. I don't want you to drive in dangerous conditions.
It's not dangerous-- not for me at least.. It's very straightforward and it has low traffic.. But that's just my opinion.. I hope you have a goodnight and some sweet dreams!. Thanks for wanting to visit.
I can be ready as soon as you like.
6am!
5am!. Just kidding :P. I was just trying to be silly.
Body problems.
It was when I was running track and I had body problems that wouldn't go away.. I told the coach and he recommended I get checked out, so I did.
That's a CAT scan.
I don't know-- I don't think it cost anything.
Yes-- they didn't figure it out :P
I'm doing alright for a hugless person.. How are you doing?
That's awesome!. I wish I could be there!. Sounds delightful!. Watch Modern Family for me :P
(hug)(hug). I bet you already planned to!
I love you too!
Good morning.. How are you?. I'm going to go print more photos (it opens at 12 today.)
I'm okay too.. Am I going to see you today?
I hope so too.
It closes at 2, but I could be done sooner.. You could always meet me on campus if you planned to come to Radford.
You can park on campus on weekends. I think Porterfield is next to Lot A.. Afterwards, parking behind the old sheriffs car is best.
Yep.. It was brown and everything.
I'm going to go get ready and then I'll head down.. Bye for now.
I will be.. The printing lab is right by the lobby.
It's possible. But I could come out early and boom!. There you are, and there I would be.. I could also come out and say hi from time to time!. Printing shouldn't take all that long.
Probably.. No food or drink is allowed, of course.
Actually-- maybe not, because we have to sign in using our student ID's.. I'll be sure to ask!. There was a group in here earlier (and I'm sure only one of them was actually in the photo class) so it should be fine.. Parenthesis was probably not the best choice to separate that sentence, but that's the way it shall remain!. Using*. But my guess is that you are not coming.. That's fine. Just keep me notified.
Okay. I. I'm walking home now.. Hello!!!. (hug)
I hope yours were just as sweet!
Good morning!. (hug). I love you!
I had Molly pose for reference!. Now I have legs :P
It would still be cool to have you in the same pose as well so that I can have varying bodies :P
Guys don't sit that way, and I'd be worried about brand recognition.. My professor said I shouldn't do anything too "burly" either because that would deter the main demographic.
I'm sorry. I just don't want to.
I hope that's not what my design "says"
Thanks!. I'll keep that in mind!. Hi!. Are you free for a call?. Sorry again.
I'll try to be less of a burden.
Good morning!
!!!. Thanks for reminding me!. Now I can eat deliciousness instead of not!. Thanks for the Yak socks! They're a bit small though-- which surprises me, as most socks fit.
I have not-- but I do have cucumber.
I'll be sure to wear them again then!. (hug). Time to build! The annotated bibliography is due at five, so hopefully I can get that done.
Cucumbers are always scary.
If mysterious cucumbers came showing up out of nowhere, I'm sure anyone would be scared.. Thanks for oatmeal!. Bye for now!. I love you, Cutie Pie!!!
You too!. I'll try to hang in there (struggling cat)
I'm going to turn the bibliography late.. I didn't manage to get anything finished.
(hug)(hug)
I don't have more time.. I just couldn't turn it in on time.
I can't.. It's too much :(
Perhaps.. After looking at some of my sources, I have found that they will not work for my paper.
Hmm... Maybe.
Thank you!. I love you!
(hug). I turned in my annotated bibliography around 7:15.. It wasn't good, but it'll be okay.
Mhmm!. Painting with tea!
Hello!. I'm not sure if I have the right kinds of tea :P
But I need specific tea.. Hello!
How's it going?
I'm just trying my hand at watercolor pencils.. I need to get this designed and printed by Friday so that I can see you and everything!
Printing services closes over Thanksgiving break.. So ready or not, here I come!
I love you very much as well!
I believe that is you!. Good morning!
Plenty of those coming your way!
Sounds delightful!
Oh no! He'll have such high expectations!
:P. (hug)
I love you too!
I hope you are too!
I haven't worked on that today-- I'm working on tea designs.
Have a nice dinner!
Of course!. (hug). Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I miss you, Cutie!. It's you!. (hug)
I've lost you yet again!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you!. Sorry.
Whoa!. My mouth just up and walked away because it couldn't handle how crazy that sounded!. Good thing I'm typing, otherwise I wouldn't be able to say anything.
I love you too!. Oh no! I didn't think that was a sad one!. I thought it was just a "I'm thinking about you" one.
Good morning!. And which one? :P. Just kidding :P. (hug)
I hope you do as well!. I'll be painting in tea by the time the day is over!
I can help!!!. Do I need to bring wood carving tools?. Or wood?. I can cut plenty of wood, since I'll be doing it anyways for my tea boxes-- which I'm going to measure today!. Just let me know dimensions! (unless you don't know those yet.). (hug)
I can help, and Scott has a planer that makes wood thinner.. You might want pine, because it's lighter than oak.. But it's still fairly sturdy.. I think he can plane oak down to a quarter of an inch-- he may be able to do the same with pine though.
He has a lot of wood from various jobs he's done in the past-- so it was all or mostly free.. Anyway! Keep telling me things, but I have to walk to class. I'll read them then!. Bye for now.
That's definitely more durable.. I can see what my brother's planer can do!. (hug). Let me know about other dimensions.
It varies.
So you just want it thinned?. What kind of design would you like?. I can start on it.
You can let me know so that I can at least plan/make roughs.. That's how big the cutter is?
The planks are more about 5-6". Okay-- interesting :P
That's fine!. We'll figure it out!. I'm making tea!. So that I may paint with it later!. I still need 3 more drawings, and I'll be ready to go!. The tea is very saturated to ensure that I have a decent range of colors.
Mhmm!. And I have masking fluid so that I can paint white outlines for my design and it will prevent the tea from spreading in those areas.. (hopefully). It works for watercolor, so I'm hoping it will work the same.
(hug)
I'm worried that my box shape may not be appropriate for "high-end". Which may be an issue.. I'm sure it will be fine.
I don't know. He just said that the shape was very "plain"
I think it will be okay.
It's a simple box, but I think I'm doing enough with the design to compensate for it.. Hello!
How are you?. I hope really well!
Chugging along!
I think we will need to purchase 1/8 or 1/4 inch wood, as the planer is going to waste the rest of the wood.
No problem at all!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Get what?. An invite for food?!?!?!. That sounds amazing!
But my Heritage!. I'm just kidding-- I'm only part Native American, and it's such a small part that it's not worth mentioning.
Something like that.
That's okay!. As you said that a different person invited me to something! :P
Oh, I don't want to go to it.. I just thought it was funny.
That's great!. It's time to mask!. :P
Yeah!. I think it's this then tea painting.. After that I have to scan them and put my design in.
I like you so much!
:3
(hug)(hug)
:P. I've only finished one :P. Masking is tough.. I think it's just liquid latex-- you can't paint with that stuff!
I can't remove the mask to reveal a clean outline.. I did that, but my professor was able to tell.
it's too "clean". Wow-- someone was using a ruling pen!. I've never heard of it before-- but it looks so much better than using a brush.
A bit late for that-- but I've got 3 done now.. Two to go!
Still masking.. I'm still at school-- I left the tea at home.
Last one. I'm heading home, then I'll add the tea.. I think this will be good for a general idea-- but I don't like the lines all that much-- but I'll figure something out!
I would really like to be finished by then to see you too!. I'm trying really hard!!. 3 of them are drying-- however, I have limited space to dry them.
I kept my door closed, I just need more space :P. Good morning!
I used a heat gun to speed things up.. I've been color editing everything.. If you had a printing service in Charlottesville, I could always print there.
It's $1 for 12x18". So it's a decent price, and it prints fairly decently.. I'm just running into trouble getting everything together.. It's taking a bit of time, and I don't think I'll make it to the Print Shop by the time it closes at 4:30.
Do you think the quality would be as good (if not better)?
Where did you check?. Places such as Office Max and Staples generally have low quality prints.
Large format scanning? That would have helped :P. The facebook page is a bit concerning.. But since I'm taking so long, I may not be able to choose.
I have to prepare part of my design as a two color print-- but I can't seem to match colors.
Which may take a while-- I can go ahead and drive over.. And then I can work on it there-- I don't think I'll finish in an hour.
I'll be sure to.. I'll get things together here, and drive over (I'll also need to switch cars with Paige). (The cop car is capable to drive around town and to and form Blacksburg-- but nothing else). from*
Thanks!. I think I got the duotone as close as I can on the one-- but I'm not entirely sure how it will print.. I have to do the other 5 as well!. But after that I mostly have to work on layouts and the information on the packaging.
Don't miss out on Pho fest!!. I'm sorry I will!
I saw. But it's 5 and it takes 2 and a half hours to arrive in Charlottesville.
I wouldn't be on Facebook-- and I'm sorry :/
I don't mind driving in the dark.. As long as you'd be ready to receive me.
Pho to Go rhymes!. That's pretty neat!. Anything I need to bring or you'd like me to pick up for you?. I will leave by 7pm.. (That's when I can trade cars with Paige)
Will do!. I'm trying to think of everything that I may need. Is it okay if I list what I have and you tell me what I could be missing?
Laptop, backpack, wallet, phone, pin, clothes, black track pants, shower shoes, towel, toothbrush/toothpaste/floss/retainer, deodorant, shower stuffs, jacket, and that's what I have.. I do not believe I have a pair of gloves-- but I do have a hat.
Sleeping bag is in the trunk, but I shouldn't forget!. I think the hat's actually in Blacksburg-- but I have the one you gave me in the car.
So, even though it's a bit snug, I'll use it to keep me warms!. Boop!
Hello there.
How is it over yonder?
You really think so?. You made sure to eat your designated personal pie?
Wow!. What'd she think?. Not terrible assuming she ate the whole thing.
The recipe only called for a cup!
Well I'm glad you like it that way.. I put in 3/4 of coconut sugar and about a tablespoon of honey and "organic" cane sugar.. And I put in half a cup of spelt flour in the crust!. (as well as some cinnamon to add a little BAM to it). Jamison Laser to answer the question I couldn't answer before.
It's the company that made the laser cutter.
Oh, there was a typo in the news article-- it's Jamieson Laser.
You can get your own laser cutter starting at $3790!
Not for secret Santa, but for your personal workshop!
The laser cutter would be nicknamed "elves",. .*
You'll be like Oprah!. "You get a lamp, and you get a lamp!". "Look under your chair-- what is it? A lamp!"
Special book??. I feel as though you need to explain.. Oh!. I'm not as familiar with Oprah Winfrey as I may have led on.
Makes sense.. I'm not sure how long using the laser cutter will take, but if it's not terribly long, I would like to see you for a bit tomorrow.. I understand if you are busy, though.
Which one is it?
Neat.
Sweet dreams to you too.. (bear hug). I love you.
Good morning.
I hope you slept well.. What are you up to?
I am prepping files to be ready to cut.. What kinds of black Friday deals are you seeing?. http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=46469366&cp=4406646.4413887.25106666.11024930.11287739.11287741&categoryId=11484063
I hear that the Condivo is more fitted-- so it's your choice.. I should probably go. I've got lamps to find and everything.. I'm not certain on coats.
I suppose I would wear it.
I don't own a decent winter coat, so I would need one-- but I think I like coats that are less "flashy". You don't have to spend so much of your time doing that though.
Or muted colors.
Do you like the way the coat looks?
I suppose function is better than form.
I don't think it looks all that cool, but I can see sporty.
http://www.jcpenney.com/claiborne-walking-coat/prod.jump?ppId=pp5005720100&catId=cat100290087&deptId=dept20000014&&_dyncharset=UTF-8&colorizedImg=DP0626201517015522M.tif. I thought this looked fancy.. This one was also fancy: http://www.jcpenney.com/claiborne-hooded-parka/prod.jump?ppId=pp5005901081&catId=cat100290087&deptId=dept20000014&Nao=48&pN=3&_dyncharset=UTF-8&colorizedImg=DP0731201517025042M.tif. But they are pretty expensive.. So no worries.
They look both fancy and warm.
I thought they were just modeling with a scarf!. That limits it to one scarf forever!
I thought about that one-- but I didn't think I could "pull off" a coat of that length.. I'm just being silly though, and I shouldn't care.. (about the way I look*)
I mean-- it's just clothes, and function is more important than the form of the clothes.. I'm going to go now. I have errands to run, as you know.. Bye for now.
I have to be in Radford by 12:50.
I have to drive there, and I have errands to run on the way.. You can have me for 30 minutes.. And I'll honestly wear anything.. I don't like the black though-- I think I'd prefer a navy blue (if it were the nylon looking jacket)
Black is very imposing, and I think the bright colors can be audacious.. I prefer things with a single color, I think.
The second one looks nice.. Though I think the first looks nice, I think people have negative connotations towards people wearing coats like that.
Yes.
I think they look nice-- I just don't want people to think negatively of me.. It's a bit silly though-- I suppose if I were to have one, I'd want it in black (though that contradicts what I said before)
Excuse me for the confusion.. Disregard what I said-- I think both coats are fine. I will go find a measuring tape and measure my chest for you.
I think a black peacoat would look nicer than the gray peacoat, but either is nice.. I am off. Any final words for me to hear before I go?. My chest is about 34 inches.. I think-- I did some unconventional methods to measure myself.
I meant between the peacoat and navy blue jacket-- either is fine.. Bye for now-- I'll try to find a nice lamp/socket for you.
Hmmmm.... I would recommend looking at the selections of paper at Mish Mish-- though I doubt they have Shoji Rice Paper, they have a decent selections.. They will be open from 10am-6pm today.. I'm looking at the online catalog-- but it's difficult to gauge the paper without seeing it in person.
I still recommend vellum.. I can go with you if you'd like, but it would have to be after horseback riding.. Either that, or you go early in the morning (which may be best.)
I will be your backup!. I'll try to remember the spray adhesive!
No problem!. (hug)
Are you concerned?. Because you should be!
Because you're going to get cuddled.
Just you wait and see!
Too bad, because you'll get more than that!. You reminded me though, that I wanted to go to Mish Mish for a cool/special type of pen.
I wouldn't want you to be limited by time!. But it would be nice (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
(hug). Good morning!
I'll see!. I have to cut all of the papers out-- but I'll try to cut 3 at a time.
He doesn't recommend cutting paper.. But there's scrap cardboard.. He said that it doesn't run on a print engine-- and only through a proprietary software.. I'm sure it could be set up to work with illustrator though-- it just isn't at the moment.. Yeah-- illustrator is a compatible software.. Everything is already set up in the .dxf format, so I don't think it would be all that necessary, unless I planned to cut again.. Some places are having Cyber Monday on Sunday night! o.o. It won't even be monday!. Have a great time riding horses!
that's good!. Hello!
Missed what?. Me?
Hello... It's me :P
I'm okay.. Just cutting away!
(hug)
!!!. I'm glad you had some!. (:. I'll be sure to make you more pumpkin pie in the future!. Or I can try out the carrot pie everyone is raving about.. (no one is raving about it)
Okay!. We can make one and you can bring it to Christmas with you!
Wow!. That sounds pretty exciting!. (hug)
Sweet dreams to you too!. I love you!
Good morning!. I got five hours, just like you said!
Eating well may be my only issue.
That's very kind of you.
That's interesting!. I don't really know how to use Venmo.
Maybe.. I have some money at the moment that I save for special occasions-- but it's been depleted before!. My teacher miscounted my tea packets.. He said I had 19 instead of 20, but when I counted (when I got home) there were 20 :P. Other than that, he said they were great.
Wow! You're going to bed so early!. I have illustrations to work on-- that I don't feel motivated to-- but I should anyway.
I suppose that's true.
Thanks!. I won't get the A, because I've only finished 2 out of the 3 illustrations I need.. And I finished the smaller ones :P
I've only got an hour-- but that includes walking to class and eating breakfast and taking a shower (possibly). And I'm not quite sure yet!
Sounds nice!. I'll have to be quick!. I'll turn in what I have, and hopefully I can turn in the bigger one later.
There are two total coming your way!
I didn't have a picture of us dancing :P
But I did have a picture of other people.
I can make one of us as well though!. I just thought the three couples were "dynamic". "Rule of threes"
Aww ^~^. Thank you!. I. I've got some done, so that's good-- just need the larger one.
Wow!. Thanks!
Not if you're both cacti!. (hug). (or should I say-- normal hug). (or bear hug, because those are cuddly)
My goodness!. Can I be where you are?. Oh, and I believe my final final will by December 17th.
I'm... not sure!. I'll see what my schedule looks like-- but things may be busy!. I suppose my Photoshop Finals are due the 13th.
You can always chill with me and we can do homework!. If you wanted.
I wouldn't have the option to not get it done.. Pie can be a surprise.
Okay :P
Oops-- I didn't get any kisses.
But not recently!
Exactly!
I can't wait!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
(hug)
:3
Good morning, Cutie Pie!. My professor thought that my illustrations looked "professional". Isn't that neat?
The ones I made specifically had a particular style he was a fan of.. (I sent you pictures). I updated them though-- because there were minor changes he wanted to see.. By updated, I mean I redid them, but that was to make sure I had originals.. Just in case I messed up!. Which I feel like my drawings are not as strong as my first ones.. But the shading is better now.
I look forward to seeing you!
:D. Good morning!. I love you!
Just for you!. So you liked my illustration for Halloween?
Awesome!. It means a lot to me that you would appreciate it!
You can see the larger version in real life too!
And the spot illustrations as well.
I'm alright. How are you?
Sounds like fun!. Skating would also have been a good idea for my journalism project.. It could have been "Winter". Because "Christmas" isn't acceptable to some people, and "The Holidays" sounds too forced.
Oh-- there's still time to produce it!
Tah tah for now, Cutie Pie!. Have fun!. And if you want to take pictures, I can draw them!
Only if you want me to illustrate it!. (hug). I love you!. I hope you had a nice day!. You joined a hackathon?. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
User Experience???. I didn't understand what was being sung.
Wow!. We're going to be doing an assignment for that soon in Motion Graphics!. So this would be very beneficial!!
Wow!. You're favorite!. Or not :P. But yes, the experience of the user for when they eat macaroni.. (kind of the example we were given)
:3. I love you!. We had a brief description of User Experience. It was like looking at Mac and Cheese is nice, but the actual experience is what captivates the user.
What is that?. Something in my eye?. That's strange.
I think that must be it.. They were cute.
Like you!
Someone must've been cutting onions.
*tackled*. I love you too, Leandra!
You definitely do!
:3. I hope your day is going really well!
(hug). I've wasted most of my day, unfortunately.
I just haven't been as productive as I should have been.. And I've been working on projects that can wait, while I have some due soon.
I definitely need to "pick up the pace" tonight and tomorrow!
I'll just have to go into panic mode!
Can't stay someway you've never been!. Just kidding.. I just meant that I would have to do everything tomorrow-- but I will utilize tonight as well.
I believe in you too!. I'm going to go to campus and do some work things!
Hmm... Nightmare Before Christmas is always a good one :P. A Year Without a Santa Clause is good.. The Ultimate Christmas Present? :P
I'm sure everyone would want to watch Elf :P. Just kidding :p
How about Jingle All the Way?. Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best!. That's not a true statement, but I thought the movie had its own little playfulness to it.. Arthur Christmas Was good, though you have seen it-- some others may have missed out on it.
I remember fond things on Miracle on 34th Street.. Not sure which version though.. I liked Jack Frost!. He became a snowman!. I'm not super positive on other movies though.. I liked Polar Express.
Ernest Saves Christmas has an adorable Santa.. I also liked Scrooged, from what I can remember-- but it may not be your "cup of tea". Have fun watching a movie that you find!
I didn't suggest those because you said you wanted new movies!
Wow. I've never heard of that.
That's good that you liked it!. And The Incredibles!~. Without me?. Lucky!!!. I like that movie!. (it's okay)
Wow!!. It's like watching it in the theater!
I wish I could watch it with you!. I guess I'll have to watch it alone.
Is it that good?
Sounds good!
Sweet dreams to you too!. I love you, Leandra!!
Good morning!. (hug)
I have only "finished" one project, so not well.. How is yours?. Good I'm hoping.. ,*
That's great!
I'm just slow at gathering creative commons images for my projects.
That and finding the images in general.. I've completed my second image.. I now need to choose a television star to make a caricature, and a book to bring to life (that's not all, but I think those are the ones I want to work on next). Boop bop!
Hello!
Wow!. For a... Birthday bash?
That's a little odd :P. Just because face cake is usually odd :P. I forgot that you had secret Santa's today!. How was that??. Did a certain someone like your gift?
Any time!. Would you like to make one for your mother as well?. And wow!. I didn't know she was getting married!
Sweet dreams to you too!. Anyone you think I should make a caricature of?. (anyone famous*). I've finished 3 of 7 projects.
I'm hoping two will be quick.
Then that'll leave me with two left.. Oh, I think I need to pick new people for my caricature.
That would be cool.. What would I talk about?. That everyone will be Psyched to find out it's returning?
Okay. Goodnight.. I love you.. Thanks for talking to me.
(hug)
I'm doing alright. "How you doin'?"
That's good!. What did you get and who was your Christmas Secret?. Secret Santa*
Wow! Liz is the other person you think is cool!!. And she knew you so well she got you penguins to cuddle with!
You're awesome!!. I never thought I'd see the day when penguins weren't at war with polar bears, but you did it!
That's not the history I learned in school :P. Just kidding, of course-- but I always wondered why the penguins needed an army.
You need a society to stay warm and work together-- an army has weapons and plans for expansion.
Oh!. Using their ninjutsu powers for good in the shadows!. How could I have been so blind before?
Through force!. Except for the puffin-- they're scary and they are stubborn.
If we somehow manage to convince the narwhals.. I think we'd be able to get the others.
Indeed.. Hey! You! I like you!
:3. I can't wait to hold your hand!
Even if you don't.. I can't wait to see you!
They are photoshop projects!. They're going alright.. I'm on my last one-- then I need to do finishing touches on a few others.. Because I tried to finish them to a good place.
Then I planned to go back!. But I'm actually at a good/decent place to be.. The final versions are due next week-- these are just comps.
I finished!
Scratch that.. Now I'm finished :P
Yay!. Now that that's checked off, I can work on other homework!. :P
The 15 page paper, 2 composited photos, a spec and brand book, illustrations, and a motion graphics final.
The spec book is due tomorrow, the (rough draft) paper due Tuesday, the photos due Wednesday, illustrations I have time to work on (and they don't take very long to do), and I think I have time (just a bit) for motion graphics and the brand book.. You know-- if you ever finished writing your story, I could illustrate it for my final :P. But that's a lot of work on you :P. Disregard that :P
I said I had time as in Finals week.
Yes.
Mhmm.. (I'm eating an apple.). So excuse the short/slow responses.
It's because of the sticker, isn't it?
The apple has been devoured.. I was just like "Om nom nom". And it's gone.. (hug). Am I sending you too many "(hug)'s". ?*
Are you sure?
Okay good. You'll get real ones too soon enough.
I'd hope so.. Could you help motivate me perhaps?
Schoolwork.
I've been avoiding it as much as possible (I've even done exercises-- more than push ups too (like-- crunches))
Thanks.. Phew.. Gotta take a deep breath and dive right in.. If I go to bed now and wake up at 6am, then that will give me 6 hours to work on the spec book.. That might be enough time.
Firefox crashed and my online alarm died with it! D:. Oh, but good morning!
I'm attacking you with stickers too often.
Are you sure? What if you get tired of talking to me?
Have a nice time!
We'll see!. I love you!. Just so you know.
Don't be a stranger now!
I know! I'm using it on you  now :P
That's you!. (hug)
I hope you are too.. I'm not doing so well, but thanks for the thought!
Not yet. We'll see.. Thanks.
Aww :3. Thanks!!. You've filled me with determination!
Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I love you so very much!
(hug). I hope you're ready for hugs!. Were you still planning on coming down for a vehicle?
Neat!. Thank you so much for the coat!!!
I don't even have to layer all that much, because it's so warm!
I just need to become muscly to fill the coat more.. /better*
I don't know! :P. (I couldn't see me all that well :P). Oh! I made a banana microwave muffin with carrot so now I have carrot cake!
Mhmm!. I haven't eaten it yet, but I'm excited!
Thanks!. Oh! And thanks for the orange shirt too!. It's very soft!. I like it almost as much as I like you!. Just kidding-- you're waayyyy out there!. The shirt doesn't even come close, but I like you even more for it!. Soon I'll only be able to reach you via rocket ship.
You can on the return trip!. (Since I'm trying to get to you in the first place)
On what in the morning!. Oh! and you're perfect! :3. I should sleep as well so that I can work on that paper!. My professor was disappointed in me.
That means a lot!. I found sources, and I can read some of them, but a lot of them I cannot access through the internet, so I'm probably going to go to the library in the morning.
I hope you sleep tight too!. I love you too!!!!11. I'm trying to stay hydrated, but I forgot to get water today! o.o. Or I mean-- I forgot to fill my water bottle.
But I've had other liquids :P. Goodnight, Cutie Pie!
Good morning, my love!
Me too!. I hope your day will be amazingly cool stuff!. I plan to go to the library and check out two books!
Mhmm! It's cool that it has them, but I may have to fill out forms and make a library card.
I found the books I need at the Radford Library, I'm not sure the University Library will have them.
:P. The McConnell library has a lot of online resources, which is good.
(hug). Random hug number one to help you keep moving through your day~
Any time!. ~Because you'll never see them coming!. Also because it's just random :P
(hug). Random hug number two!!
Just for you!. I think I'm ready for new sleeping schedule.. I had 6 hours of sleep last night, but I had 3 the night before and I think 5 before that.. I feel like I could nap at any time!
I'm sure!. Are you still working on your sleeping.
I don't think you should feel the need to conquer it, but good for you!. !!!. Hey! If you visit, I only have one image to turn in for Sunday!. All the others my professor said were good to go, so I'll definitely have time if you want to spend yours with me!. --- to clarify, I have my photoshop finals due Sunday. He said that I only needed to make minor changes to my last one and it would be good to go as well!
It means that six of my comps were good enough to be my finals, and I only have to make minor changes to the seventh and I'm good to go!. I spent a good amount of time on my comps as well, so it feels good that it's only one that I need to finish off!
I finished my photography final today, so I don't have to worry about that.. Packaging and motion graphics are due Wednesday. My paper is due Thursday the 17th, and illustration is due Tuesday.. So the only thing I'm worried about is the 15 page paper.. I have a good amount of information for my brand book from when I made my spec book and I took clinical photos already, so I just need the artistic and stylistic photos.. And I think I've decided on a fairly simple idea for motion graphics, so I'm not worried about it.. Illustration might be a little more complicated, but we'll see.. 2 out of 6 done though, just to summarize.
Thanks!. I'm feeling good about it-- but the paper is concerning me purely out of the amount I need to read and write.
I feel like I should get a good portion all at once, because that helps retain the same voice throughout (perhaps)
Of course not! Novels are much more complicated.. Are you happy?
I think so.. I worry sometimes that I cannot make you happy from such a distance.. And that you may try to find someone closer that can.
I'm just checking! I just hear things from time to time that cause my to worry.
Other people I talk to.. But also you a little bit.
It's what I said before.
Just that you may have found someone else to be romantic with.
It's what I meant when I said "happy"
Okay!. Are you free for a call?. I've been released from class early!
Well no rush!. You can call when you're ready.
Tah tah for now.. You look very nice in the Christmas photos.. Not to say you do not look nice every day, but I rarely see you.
No need to thank me, it is I who should be thanking you.
Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I hope you sleep super well!
:P. That's funny.
Me neither.
That's good!. Have a great time!
That sounds nice. I wish I could hear it.
Oh-- I mean I wish I could hear it in person.
Sounds delightful!. I completed 3 pages, but they are lacking in sources.
Hello.. How was the concert?
That's good.
I'm getting my "easy" work out of the way because it's due sooner.. I'm glad you had a good time.
Wow!. You're leaving at 8?. What did Tanul say?. I can make something and you can bring it back to her :P. I can do the same for you housemates-- since I owe them bunches for allowing me to stay so often.
How could you!!. Just kidding. It's okay.. You can always text her if you wanted.. If you have her number of course.
!!!..... Just let me know :P. (L. (: *
De nada.. I would be glad to.. I love you, Leandra. I hope you have wonderful dreams tonight.
Whoa! I didn't know you were a vampire now.. (*v~v*). I'm kidding, because the "W" actually looks like double v's.. Make a wish!
I hope your wish was a good one!. Sleep tight!. I'll be available tomorrow, if you wanted to see me.. Otherwise, I can probably stay in Radford and do work.. You're also welcome to join me in Radford-- depending on your preference.
I would love to be distracted, even if for just a little while.
I love you too!. Sweet dreams! Be safe!!!
I hope that the trip was safe!
Wow! That's great!. Because that means you are safe.
I'm about to work on some illustrations.. Since there are two desks here, you're welcome-- or I can come to you!
I have most of the resources that I need in Radford.. And I don't believe I need anything in Blacksburg-- but I can always gather my things and visit.
I bet she would!. I'll try to get my illustration done. I think most of my other work would be fairly easy to do elsewhere.
Right now?
Is that 3 hours?. That sounds nice (:. I'll have to gather my things.
What kind of activities?. (It won't affect my decision much, I just wanted to know)
Wow!. Well I suppose we could decide when we're together.. I will gather my things-- hopefully I don't forget anything!. Oh, and you should ask your mother just to be safe.
Let me know (:. (the answer). :P
I'm getting ready, but I would like the confirmation.. I'll leave as soon as I can though, and I can leave if it turns out to be a no.. Anything you would care for me to bring?
Okay!. I'll be there in a bit.
Depending on traffic, I'd say about 30 minutes.
Excuse me for the wait then.
I did not realize that is what you wanted.
I'll remember that for next time.
I can do that.. Which is your preference.
We can always do both and go to another--
Oh, but I can meet you at the duck pond for certain.. I think I'll bring my tea boxes so I can take photos of them later (not while we're at the duck pond, but for homework purposes)
Sounds great!
Bye for now.
I'm safe! Goodnight and sweet dreams! It was really nice spending time with you!
If only the day could have continued!. :3
It could have continued in our sleep!. Sleep tight! Don't let the Peter's nibble on your nose!
Good morning/afternoon!. I hope your day is going well!. I would like to work on homework with you!
Thank you!. Did you want to go to the library or... somewhere with me?
The place of your preference/choosing.
So you would like to do homework outside?
I thought that I saw an outlet at the park shelter-- but I could be mistaken.. How does 3:45 sound?
Great. See you then.
Your pick.. I was thinking the park by your house.. But I can drive us anywhere in search for an electrical outlet.
Would you need help with that?
I can make that happen!. I love you too!!!!!!!. (hug). I hope you had safe travels!. https://www.google.com/search?q=fretless+finger+guide+violin&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6o5fHpNnJAhWCJh4KHYVcCbYQ_AUICSgD&biw=1527&bih=776. This might be helpful for you while you learn violin!
If you would like, I can print one on a transparency-- then you can attach it yourself.
I understand. It seems like it could be helpful though!. You'd only need your violin!
Alright. I was watching someone who was teaching themselves, and they recommended it.
Okay.. How's your day going?
Okay! Have a nice nap!. My day is alright. I've been taking pictures for my project.
Just before the sun went down.. I'm planning on going to the grocery store and ask if I can take pictures there as well.
Yep.. I thought a picture of my tea boxes on a store shelf would be good.. Because we needed to design our packaging to fit within standard shelving.
Lighting won't be good, but maybe that'll be what makes it good.
It just gives it accurate representation.
I love you too!!!!!1
I just got to Radford.. I took pictures at Wades, because Kroger has a strict policy.. But I think things went well!
I didn't ask at Wades!. I just snuck in because there weren't many employees to ask.. I slid in and slid out with only one employee spotting me.
You're sneaky!!!. (hug)
So sneaky.
Tah tah for now!
I'll be here whenever you want me!
:D. ^~6. O no! My eye!
I haven't said sorry in quite a while!. What have I done to hurt you?. D:
Oh.. I meant to ^~^, but I ^~6
You've got this!
Some of those "sorry's" are out of context, and those were in November. Did you see any from December? I don't think so.
Maybe.. just maybe!. I shouldn't be so sassy though.
I'd rather not. :P
I see.. Oh! I'm distracting you still!
(hug). I believe in yoU!. you*
I'll just hug you while you work!
!!! That's nice of you! :3. But I can be making the pancakes!
Tah tah for now!. (hug)
Do you need to go over there and hug it out?
Because she's so cool. You gotta go over there, hug her, and tell her how much you appreciate her.
Just leave the card on her bed for her to find it.. Kind of like a surprise.. Or you leave it on her locker-- like a secret admirer.
No-- it's a "friend bug"
Or a "shield bug". But that's just based on its shape, and not on how friendly it is.
Good luck!!!. I'll get back to work too!
I can't wait either! I love you so much too!
:P. How'd they get there?
I appreciate the potato puns.. spud pun?. Tuber humor?
I'm glad.
She should grow more potatoes!
rawr. !!!!
:3
I love you!
Hug time!. (hug)
:3. I got new pens!. The last one I got wasn't waterproof!
The ink doesn't bleed when water goes over it-- so a permanent pen.
But not like a sharpie, it's an artists pen.
One of the fancy pens that you dip into the ink would have been neat, but it's just a regular old pen.. There was an ink crisis of 2009?
Definitely.
!!!!!!!. That's so soon!. I'll have to prepare myself!
The yellow one is nice!
Sweet dreams to you too!
Me too!
You too!. I love you!
Are you going to go see Star Wars with your brother?. It seems like something that he may want to see (if he doesn't see it before you go over). Then again-- I am making assumptions, as he might not be a "Star Wars Guy"
Sounds like fun!
!!. Good luck!
Not that you need it!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0z9boqWD40
Mhmm!. It'll help while you study! Maybe...
Yep! Plenty of music for you!
The cool song is the second one!. You can check the description to find the time!. 2:09
I'm alright-- just working on illustration.. How are you doing today?
That's great!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFpvu8EG-kQ. (Just so you can go straight to the song)
That's good!. And sounds nice!
That's awesome!. You're awesome!. Keep up the good work!
That's great!
I've still got to draw it!
Is that me?. That looks like me.
Oh.. Could've sworn it was me.... :P. (hug). I just need to outline my drawings and then paint them!. I didn't get to the comic comic though.
Thanks!. I'm growing concerned about the paper I have.
I know. But my illustration is due tomorrow.
I don't have the research under my belt yet.
Nothing substantial at the moment.
I'll try!
Sweet dreams to you too!
Too bad I haven't any shorts!. I love you!. I hope your day is going really well!
Time for science!
Yes.. I bet it's good!. How could you not love Love Sushi King?
Dude... you can't knock it until you try it, Dude!. I'm just teasing you, of course!. I don't want to be mean!
I don't mind it! I think it's kind of cute!
I'm crazy about you, dude!
:3. I want to nap, but I'm worried I won't wake up to an alarm.. Dilemmas :P. Duo-llamas
I'll just keep trucking without naps.
I'm not stressed, just tired.
No. I have things due tomorrow around 2 and 5.
I don't know.. I'm worried I'll have less time than I think I have.. Maybe I'll nap for an hour.
I don't feel very productive at the moment :P
Sounds good. But It'll just be a nap.. Then I'll work until I can sleep again.
okay. I'll nap for an hour and a half.
Thanks! Me too!. I love you!. Can't wait to see you!!!
(hug)\. Hello!. (hug)
Sweet dreams you too!. to* you too!
Good morning!. Just 6 pages left and I'll be golden.
My brand book is due today, the paper is due tomorrow.
I just finished! I added another page though.
I was working on the photography portion, which involves editing and color correcting.. And sizing.. Although I have more pictures, and it's not all that even-- seeing as I included 4 pages for Stylized, and 3 for Artistic, I think it will be fine.. Now it's time to spend $50 to print it.. After that I need to work on my motion graphics final-- but I think I'm in decent shape for those classes.
Thanks!. Printing always concerns me-- but there's not much I can do about it.. My professors want nice copies-- and a regular printer won't cut it.
They do recommend it.
My pdf isn't exporting for the life of me!. I understand what you're saying.. This is my last thing to print-- so hopefully it won't be an issue.
I feel like he won't, because it's the final and it's due today.
I can't give a digital copy if my pdf doesn't export.
I'm going to restart my computer, because this is taking longer than it should.
I can't try it on another computer if it doesn't export.... I would need to package the file which takes longer.
It is an indesign file, but you need the links and fonts to be properly linked.
That sounds great! What about the... play (?) your mother invited us to?
I thought it was Friday :P. I finished my motion graphics assignment and outside of a minor error on page 4 in my Brand Book, all I have left is my paper!
It's loud in here, so once I'm home... I'll be working on the paper for the rest of the night!. Hello!
How are you?
I'm alright.. Just chugging along.
We'll see.. Phew.. The few hours of sleep I'm running on, is starting to get to me.
I wish I could. It's so late that who knows if I'd wake up!. But it's okay!. I just took a break-- I think staring at a computer all day was tiring me out, and I just needed to get away for a bit.. How are you doing??. ^-^
That sounds nice!. I'm readying biographies.
It's exciting, for certain.. I'm finding difficulty starting my paper, but we'll see.
It's a paper about Winnie the Pooh-- and I'm relating words with images.
I do not have a strict format for the paper.
I'm not all that familiar with DBQ's.
I appreciate it too.
Not really.
I don't believe I do.
My paper is titled: "The Men Who Hated Winnie the Pooh"
My idea was to explore the lives of the three people involved in Winnie the Pooh-- A. A. Milne, the author, E. H. Shepard, the illustrator, and Christopher Robin Milne, the inspiration.
And, though Winnie the Pooh is beloved by many, it did cause issues for those involved.
I'm relating the illustrations created by E. H. Shepard with the writings of A. A. Milne.. I'm trying to explore their reasons for creating the story.. And I want to explore their fame-- as A. A. Milne never saw the same fame as he did with Winnie the Pooh. E. H. Shepard saw too much fame-- as the popularity of Winnie the Pooh increased the amount of work he had to do, which decreased the amount of work he was more passionate for.
A. A. Milne was heavily inspired by his son, Christopher Robin, the owner of the stuffed animals featured in the Winnie the Pooh books.. And E. H. Shepard desperately wished to illustrate the book of verses for A. A. Milne.
It's like a research paper.. But I'm not sure.. I honestly haven't read enough to know where to go.
She would actually prefer quality over quantity.. She said a 12 page minimum would be okay.
As long as it was quality.. I've been planning the structure. I was thinking I would introduce the idea that Winnie the Pooh was a blessing, but a curse. :P. Then I was going to give brief biographies of A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard and how to came to work at Punch magazine.. I was then going to discuss the inspiration of Winnie the Pooh-- which is almost entirely based on events/characters A. A. Milne witnessed.. Then I was going to discuss how Winnie the Pooh affected the three of them. A. A. Milne tried to escape from the jaws of being a children's author, E. H. Shepard resented the idea of him being solely known for Winnie the Pooh, and Christopher Robin wanted to "make it" on his own. (So that would be three paragraphs)
Sounds nice. I'll try to write write write the night away.
That's the plan.. Phew :P. How goes packing/cleaning?. I'm going to take a nap!. I don't want to oversleep, but I definitely am not as focused as I could be.. I did take some notes, so that's good.. But I'm hoping to wake in 20 minutes, and if not then, I set an alarm for an hour and half.
Sounds great!. Quick 20 minute nap!
Thank you!. I honestly feel like it may be a mistake though.
I'm just worried that if I don't let my mind rest for a bit, then it will create a worse paper.. So just for a bit.. Would you like to read what I have so far?
Okay. Thanks.
Who knows if I'll even finish it on time.. If you happen to still be awake in 20 or so minutes, do you mind giving me a wake up call?. I've set 4 alarms on firefox, 3 on chrome if firefox crashes, and 3 on my phone.. But I want to be extra cautious.
Of course. I just want the extra "cushion"
You missed out on my "I love you."
:3
Good morning!. I love you!
(hug)
That only looks slight creepy (the fake cat)
That 93 year old just voided the entire video!
Or difficult, because you don't have directions.. Anyway-- I'm in Blacksburg!
That makes sense.. I wish I had gotten the chance to see you today.
I suppose... but I would have given even better hugs today!
That sounds great.. Oh, because I'm so sleepy that I'll just be extra cuddly.. Wow! If you press shift-tab you can switch between several chat boxes on facebook.
I understand.... Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I can also come get you!. Hiking sounds nice!. Oh, and I just checked-- I have 11 credits next semester, so I need five classes to have 14 (the minimum is 12). I would like to spend as much time with you as I can.
I don't think those are available, but if it is, it'll be in the depths of course search.
I would like a ride there, I don't think my car would fare well at an elementary school.. I know that's silly to say, but I think with the way things are nowadays.... I can't sort by number of credits without selecting a course.. Never mind, I found the option for it.
That is what I was implying.
I don't think so-- but anything can be construed that way.
What would be your preference then?
Repaint the entire car without the special painters?
It's very expensive.
I'll ask him about it.
Does seem sketchy-- but you have a good thought there.
Perhaps.
That sounds delightful!. If you hadn't included "and me" I would be hesitant though.
Okay!. (hug)
I don't mind where, I just want to be with you!
manjar? There's a man in a jar???. I've never heard of alfajores, but I'm assuming its la comida, so si!
Looks like a macaroon.
That's what I saw when I googled!
And you're going to hide them in the eggs???!?
Why did I think you said Easter eggs?. Safe at home??
Good!. I was getting worried that you would never let me know!. Just kidding-- but gotta doorknob next time!
That sounds like it would be a nice sunrise hike!. I love you!
I don't think my coat would be light enough to ride the horse.
I'm not sure if I want to.
I'm not a fan of the weather.. I'd rather do it in better weather.
That's not so bad, because I don't have a horse to worry about.
Like I said-- I'd rather not in such weather.
Yes.. You are welcome to, of course.. We can go ice skating, if you like.
I said we could go ice skating.. I feel like it won't be very enjoyable.
Ice skating doesn't sound so bad.
I feel like 44 degrees is pretty cold.. But if you really want to, I won't mind going.
Usually my legs, face, and hands.
I don't have any to borrow-- but I should have some of my own :P
Unless I borrowed those a long time ago and never gave them back :P
I don't have any warm socks.. Oh no! I knew I forgot something in Radford!!
Sure.. Let's do this.
I shouldn't hold you back.
They do not.
They are too small.
I have the shoes I've been wearing-- they have a heal :P
They're pretty great!
^-^. I think I had two other ones, but I misplaced them!
Okay! I'll be sure to.
My car is blocked in.. Unfortunately.. But I'll see if someone can move the car in the morning.
I suppose my mother will be asleep during that time.. And she would be the only one available to move the car.. I know you don't want to drive... I'll see what I can do.
Goodnight.. Sweet dreams.
Fortunately we didn't get hurt! Or at least-- not for a long period of time.
Good!!. (:. Thanks for letting me know!. I'm extremely sad that I will likely see very little of you.. But I think I held my composure.
Is that a game or a creepy animal?
The way we departed wasn't the way I wanted to either, but that's partly my fault.. My packaging professor offered to write a letter of recommendation for me, but I'm not sure how to respond to the email.. I'll figure it out. Thanks for today. Enjoy the nature documentary.
Probably not.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I meant that I probably didn't need additional information.
Good morning.. How did you sleep.. ?*
?*alright.. I slept*. I hope you have a nice day today.
Thanks.. Have safe travels.
I'll see you around.. I hope you enjoy the granola0-- it can be a nice travel snack.
I don't want to be any trouble. Don't worry about it.
If you stay in town any longer, you should spend some time with Twe.
I don't expect you to. You'll have plenty of time to eat it.
I suppose that would do it.. I am available if you want to see me. Otherwise, have a great Christmas and New Years and overall great break.
I would like to spend time with you. We could write stories, or draw things, or we could play games.. Or anything.. We can make those cookies.. That's actually on the top of the list.
Well was there anything you wanted to do?
But I can use suggestions from you to supplement the day.. What if you have great ideas that I don't think about?
I thought Tower Ascension was fun-- maybe we could play that for a bit?
I don't want to surprise you, because I feel you won't like what I surprise you with.. Do you have all of the necessary ingredients for the cookies?
Okay. I have to wait for Paige to return the car for me to come over.
Okay. I'll let you know when I can come over.. You can also let me know the same.. First things first, we have to make your cookies, but while we do so, I have made a selection of 2-3 movie options. A Cat in Paris and The Secret of the Kells, both of which are on Netflix. Song of the Sea is another option, however is not currently on Netflix. (I think any of these movies will be a great pick, so it really doesn't matter which ones we watch) As for games, I found a cute looking Wii game that is for two players. I also have Earthbound that you got me for my birthday-- it is only single player, but you said you wanted to watch me play it (I thought we could play it together.) There is also the option of bringing the wireless xbox controller adapter, and we can play anything you wish to on Steam (I don't have as large of a library as you do). I mentioned before that the ice cream maker is ready for action, so we can make some frozen treats to enjoy while we do things. I also thought we could take drawing/doodle breaks and possibly story writing breaks.. I also have loaded the most recent Gravity Falls and Steven Universe episodes.. Oh, and I just checked, the final episode of Psych is available on Netflix, so that is always an option.. This sounds like a lot, and it is. We definitely don't have to do everything, but everything is there for your choosing.. Please give your disapproval on things so that I'm not carrying more than we're going to end up using.. I'm available now, please let me know!
If the ice cream is banana, then isn't it "good" sweets>. ?*
Okay, good.. Anything else?
Oh.. Of course... I guess I didn't expect you to want to do that.. Okay.. I'll gather my paints instead.
Okay.. I unfortunately do not have any paper or canvases to paint on and my oils and watercolors are in Radford-- the remaining acrylic are dried or limited in color.
I will be free.. That doesn't leave us with much today.
Nothing in particular.. We can go back to a "do what Leandra wants to do" type of day though.
I was particularly keen on watching animations, but I understand that it's not necessarily your interest.. We could make a video game together.. I may have to use the time learning how to use certain 3d programs though.
Okay.. Never mind.
I cannot think of anything.. I might just be terrible to spend time with.
I honestly feel like you've made the itinerary null and void.
Not really.. Cookie making is being postponed to tomorrow, so the movie would be as well.. I mentioned a game for the Wii and also using the wireless controllers to play games on steam.. I said we could use the ice cream maker-- but you've had enough sweets already. And that leaves us with doodle and story writing breaks-- both activities that can be done alone.. Maybe I can see you tomorrow instead.. You should spend time with Twe and go play billiards at Squires (unless they're closed). They are open.
You don't want to do what I want to do.
I'm pretty sure it's more than just those two things that you don't want to do.
I just listed everything that was left and it was the Wii game and doodles.
I've been waiting, because I don't know what to bring.. You've made this difficult for me.. Do you still want me to come over?
Okay.. You will have to give me time to pick the car up and to get gas.. I will also have to change from what I'm wearing.
Only blue was in the box.
Green and brown.
Oh no! I didn't get this message in time. http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/27/sony-13-inch-digital-paper-e-ink/. You win.
I can't wait for you to watch it!. Make a wish!!!. We had a halo around the moon! It's kind of sort of interesting!. You'll have to trust me, of course, as the picture quality that I can send through facebook isn't all that good.
It's better in person, I assure you!. Merry Christmas!!!!!1
I hope it's really nice for you!!. (:. I love you, Leandra!
(hug). I hope you get everything you wanted on your Christmas List!
Oh, I changed my profile picture, just like you suggested!
I was going to change it back though, because I prefer when you're with me!
I was really impressed with this animation ^^^
The quality and the length that was made was just impressive, because I'm watching these other animations by other students and they are not produced nearly as well.. I also think it's pretty cute, and I thought you may like it too.
I think the animation was fairly fluid, and the character drawing style was nice.. Both did not have voices-- just sound effects and music.. So if you want, you can watch them without the audio.
Is that what you keep asking me to draw? I don't recall you ever asking :P. http://www.aciap.org/illustration/
Less impressive than cute dogs?
Their own special place?. That's nice!
Illustration for Comics and Graphic Novels. I think a similar class would be cool.
Sweet dreams! Thanks for talking to me!!!. (It's a great Christmas present!)
(Because presence is more important than presents). This one was also nice (style wise) and the sound doesn't affect it much.
Merry Christmas!. Yeah! Remember? You said that it would be funny if I only cropped the lamb as my picture.
Oh, right. I just thought you would think it would be funny this way too.. :P. It's only temporary, of course.
I see...
As long as it were temporary, and we had joked about it prior.
A day or two, just so you make your point :P
Nothing much. I've been looking into some maya tutorials, and I might try to draw something.. What are you up to?
That sounds... painful!. I'm sorry to hear of your pain!
I didn't figure it was :P. I thought you were exaggerating.
(hug)
Ooo!!. That's fancy!
You can use Google in the states-- and it's nothing different in Paris :P. (Peter's kidding, of course)
I'm sure.
That's an option!. You can also sketch the people!
Oh.. it's good practice for figure drawing.. It's not creepy if you're an artist.
You're welcome.. I hope your Christmas has been grand!
We ordered Chinese, because it was open on Christmas.
Yeah! I said "We're having a Jewish Christmas". It was super cute!. Not as cute as you though-- so I'd much prefer having a profile picture of me holding you.. I actually said we were having Christmas in China Town.. And I said it could be the title of a song.
See? It sounds like it could be!. When is your mother returning?. I hadn't finished those dishes yet, and I wanted to before she returned home.
Okay! That's plenty of time.. Oh!. I can run over there now and run the disposal.
It won't be an issue (:
I lub you too!
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!
I can still do that :p
I sure do! It was delicious!. I love you, Leandra!
Feel free to use me for any design work for Winter Pennapps
You still want me to go with you?. I would gladly, but I'm not registered.
If you like.
It doesn't give me the option to register.. It only allows me to login with an existing username and password, which I do not have.
My login is my email.. I tried resetting the password, but it said that my email was not on record.
Yes, and I did not register.. So it makes sense that I wouldn't be on any record.
Join as in "going"?
Okay...?
I suppose we will.
How is your day so far?
Wow!. So much Pho!. Pho sho!. That's Pho-ntastic!. I hope you have Pho-n!. Or--- Could you autograph this? I'm your biggest pho-n!. And now I'm done.. That was a bit excessive.. I don't think Christmas Eve impacted the collection times for refuse and recycling.. So unfortunately, it won't be taken until next week.. And it appears that you have recycling days every other week?
It's fine! I understand where you were coming from!. I'll be sure to put the receptacles back!. And I'll eat the curry.
You're cute!!!. That's you!!. 100%
I love you!
Was there anything else you wanted from me?. Dishes have been put away, new dishes have been washed, trash has been put back in its place, disposal has been run, and curry has been successfully eaten.. If so, I can always come back.. Is that okay?
Not a problem!. A CNC machine seems super neat!
I think there is too.. From the article I saw that mentioned the laser cutter.
I'd rather look forward to them than to watch out!
Okay! I'll also try to learn to drive a stick shift.
And I'll update my passport.
Whoa?. Canada?
Whoa eh?
One for your mother did.. It was fairly small though.
Was that the one?
Whoa... are you just getting that message?. Or am I just getting that message?
Oh. I see!. Kind of.. Maybe.... Not really. Where were we?. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I'm just being silly!
Have safe travels! I love you!. There's a pair of 7.5 riding boots at the YMCA currently. They seem perfect for you!
They don't have all that much wear, could use a polish, but they still have the cardboard inserts they came with.. The shoes looked good toe wise.. They were a bit pricey, so my dad was going to check on them on Tuesday when he can use his connections :P
Riding boots are hard to hide, as they are knee high. They look between 1 to 1.5 inches. I thought the heal helped when riding.. What price do you think is a good price as far as boots go?. They would be a gift, of course.
Wow!. Okay!
I love you too!. Still sitting in the terminal?
Wow!. It's happening!!!. I want to make a game!. But I'm currently writing ideas down for stories.
Be safe over there!. Be sure to let me know when you land!
Wow! Does the sleeping position accommodate for two?
Wow!. That sounds nice!. You should do that!
I'd hope so!
Wow! You pick me of all people??. I'll try to have my schedule clear for such an occasion!
:3
Japan would be awesome!
No, we should just live there.. Because there's never enough time.
'Merica!
Awww *hugs planet*
I'm alright. Writing stories n' whatnot.. How are you doing?
Wow! They have showers over the pond?. And you're... reading in the shower?. Actually, I'm more surprised by the last part... I was joking about the first part.. Oh.... it's your waterproof case?. The stories aren't anything to talk about yet-- but I'll get a good one soon enough.. I'm mostly brainstorming.
Oh :P
Maybe I should!. Specifically organic Turmeric Ginger tea.. (because you're on that one and you're my muse)
Tah tah for now.
I love you so so much too!. You're amazing, yourself!. What time is it where you are?
Goodnight and sweet dreams then! (hug)
Good morning!. I love you too, Leandra!!!
Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I love you too!. My day is alright. How is your day?
I cleaned my laptop, because it needs that sort of attention every once in a while, and I compiled notes to consider when approaching a story.. I'm about to go to my grandmothers to relieve Paige of her duties temporarily.. While there I'm probably going to be hard at work :P. Hopefully!. What did you do today?
Yeah. I found that people start off with the setting, then with characters.. After characters are developed, they start with dialogue.. I have notes on how to do those things-- I might practice a bit first, but I'm hoping to start something!. But what did you do today?. Unless of course you did something unspeakable and don't want to tell me... like... kicking a puppy!
Did you feel safe the whole time?. What part of Paris?. I remember that last time you went on one of these trips that you didn't want to tell me anything.... So I won't bother you for any more information.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Wow! That bear looks like it's hugging you!. I'm glad you like your group-- that makes the adventure that much more enjoyable.. Have fun with your readings.
Wow!. You're awesome!!
I keep wishing I was there too! I'd say I wish you were here, but here isn't as cool :P
That's not a polar bear, but maybe the bear recognizes that you are tight with polar bears, which makes you tight with all bears.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
(hug). It okay though. Bears are all fairly similar-- but polar bears have pretty long necks.. It's*. I'm glad that you have your camera and gopro!. When should I return the keys to your mother?. Or should I hang on to them, since she will join you in Paris?. Good morning!
Sweet day dreams!
I hope you have another great day in Paris!
Thank you! (:. I look forward to hearing of your adventure!
I more or less just watched my grandmother :P. But I do have more notes.. And "research" compiled.. I think you're going to be overwhelmed by the stockpile of hugs I'm saving for you.. I'm sorry I missed the call!. Good morning!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I love you!
(hug). I hope today was a great day for you!!
Oh! I see...!!
My day is alright.. You'll get your hugs soon enough!. Just so you know...!
I'll let you rest up for another great Paris day.. I'm probably not very great to talk to after what you've experienced.. I'm just "normal"
Goodnight!. You can tell me of your stories when you have time!. Wow!. That looks professional!. Wow! Did you have a lock for that?. You would have had to have met someone to become romantic with, but then.. you'd be set!
Totoro!
Well we can always return and put our lock there!
It's what relationship peoples do.
I know-- it's just symbolic.. Sleep tight!
Wow!
And you ate her?. Hence the "om"?
Oh... so you want to?
I wish I could do that..
Well I hope you can spend more time with her!
You've got this.. I believe in you! Invade her friendship!
Just don't sink the ship!. That won't be good.
I love you too!
Okay-- just don't say anything, and you'll be alright!
You said it, not me!. Sleep tight!. Good morning, Cutie!
Wow... New Years Eve in the city of lights.. I bet that's nice!. (hug)
Oh no! I lost you!. Then you were back, but then I lost you again.. I'll talk to you later! Good luck with your readings!. I love you!
It's only 4pm here, so I should be saying sleep tight to you!. I've got a whole other 6 or so hours before it's bedtime.
Thank you!. I don't have any New Years plans, but I'll try to have a nice time.
10 minutes!. Happy New Year!!!!. I would have been here to say it to you, but I was walking my grandmother to the restroom.
I've got a few hours before its a new year!. Friendly in a good way?
Or a bad way?
People are kissing you?. And they aren't me?. And was that in a good way?
You kiss people to say Happy New Year?
I guess that sounds... nice?. I think it'd only be nice coming from you-- but I don't think I've ever been greeted like that.
I think my grandmother (on my mothers side) does that.
I love you too!. I'll be asleep too!. :P. Sweet dreams to you! Sleep tight!
Wow! Is that something you'd be interested in?. The Polaroid camera?. Happy New Year!
It sounds neat!. But you would be interested in the other thing?. Good morning!
Wow! :3
Thank you!!
I did not celebrate.. It just passed on by.
I did not make nay resolutions either.. I made this old man sprite though, among others.
It's made of pixels and it's a screen capture.. Which would be my only explanation.. Have a great day today!
That makes sense!. I love you and your punny self!. (hug)
Bye for now!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtEhX7mhDJc. Goodnight.. Aww :3. You look so happy!
I'm okay! How are you??. I love you too!! You're great (:. Sleep tight!
It looked like you did in the photo I saw.. Is that your new friend?. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Somethings have been nagging at me since you left.. Some things*. Good morning, Leandra!
That's her moniker now? That's pretty cool.. I'm probably just over thinking things.. Anyway... good morning! I suppose it's afternoon now, and it will soon by night time, but can't miss out on something as important as morning!. Goodnight! I love you, Leandra!
I don't know-- just comments you may have made.. Silly things about flavors and things :P
I don't know. You made a comment about flavored things, and I didn't know you knew about flavored things.
I don't know how you learned such a thing.
Etcetera raises some flags :P
Etcetera could be anything!
Like-- what if you learned from someone?
I never heard about that in health class.. Sorry-- this isn't the kind of conversation you should come to. How was Paris?
My day was alright.. I was babysitting my grandmother.. I cleaned her kitchen and "made" her food.. She wanted vienna sausages-- which I thought was strange.
I had to eat some, because she couldn't eat all of them!
Yeah-- I worked on sprites inbetween things.
Do you like Vienna sausages? I think I may have heard you mention something about them, but I am not a big fan.
That makes sense. I washed mine before eating them, which made them okay.. I apologize for worrying about things before.
I don't think it came to any resolution, but no problem.. I'll let you get to sleep-- I'm sure you had a long day, and that you're about to have another one. Good luck with your readings, if you haven't finished them already.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
It was nice talking to you.. I can't wait to talk to you in person.. And I can't wait until I can talk to you for longer amounts of time.
And don't forget that pictures are always appreciated!. Good morning!. I tend to stay up so I can get you every morning!. I haven't had much luck as of late, but I'm hoping eventually I'll catch you!
Wow! It must be nice to sleep in with Leandra! :P. Goodnight. I hope you had another nice day.
My day is okay.. How was yours?
Did you have an umbrella??. You should get one if not.. I'm multitasking, but I'm still making sprites.
You might be able to find some nice ones!. I've got a nice red one here that would have been easy to pack-- maybe I can give it to your mother and she could bring it to you-- it might not be there when you need it, but it might help. Just another option.. I'll let you get to sleep so you can have a great day tomorrow!
That sounds good. The one I have is super small!
It's pretty compact, is what I mean, but it's a big enough umbrella.. Or.. will be when you open it!. I'm not actually using it either, so you're welcome to it.
Okay.. I miss you.. I suppose it has gotten late. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Sleep tight. Don't let the French bed bugs bite!. They have little berets and baguettes and they'll getcha!
Good! You don't want any of that delicious and perfectly crispy bread!. On a more serious note... I love you, and I'm glad you're having fun.
What? You gotta stay away from crepers.. (creepers). I hear crepes are fairly easy to make! And since they are so versatile, then you could have one all the time :P
I think they are similar to pancakes as far as how you make them.. I hope you sleep super well!. Good morning!
Have a great day today!. I hope you slept well!!
Thank you.. I'll try to have nice dreams.. If you're involved, they sure will be!. I'm here whenever you want to chat and for whenever you want to send pictures.
Wow! That picture has so much suspense!. You don't have to worry about me on your trip though!
I suppose they looked nice.. Were you in the fanciest of stores? The suspenders, shoes and bowties were super fancy. It's everything you need to be fancy in one convenient corner.
They have those in France?. Wow :P. I didn't know you were a professional photographer!!!
One you dance on?. There's a regular piano (from the google search I just found) in Luxembourg Garden.
Probably not.. http://streetpianos.com/paris2015/. It's from June 2015, so it may or may not still be around.. But I'm also sure you've seen this before.
Oh. So it's a scavenger hunt of sorts?. It's snowing here.. What are you/have you been doing today? I'm about to go to an orthodontist appointment.. Then I'm getting my ADDY entrees together.
The appointment is a check up for my retainer.
Gotta retain the retainer so it can retain my teeth!. I think it's funny that you think an orthodontist appointment is "neat" but what you're doing is far more interesting.
But a better different :P. It's new an exciting :P. and*. Enjoy yourself.. Have a great rest of your day.
That sounds nice!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I hope your day was as great as you are.. Sleep tight.. Good morning.
You have such a nice view!
I love you very much too!. How is your day?
That's great!. What have you been up to?
That sounds nice.
OTP: One True Pairing. And there was "shipping"
What do you need it for? :P. If you don't mind me asking.
I see. I thought that you needed it for other reasons :P
I don't know-- maybe you were describing a couple :P
I've been trying to get through my list of duties, but I haven't gotten through much yet.
Just my "to do list". My personal to do list-- like I need to make a phone call, I need to prepare my ADDY entrees, I need to work on two books, I thought I might start on a comic, and I have the game development doc to work on.. I'm going to need to know how to code to do that last one.
You're right-- but I changed the spelling on the white board :P
You weren't there for that, so it's not relevant to you.. Oh... I would need to make a portfolio for that.
I need a portfolio in general-- I wasn't looking at a job.
I'm pretty sure it's pretty standard for Graphic Design jobs.
I haven't anything in an actual portfolio.
I don't think I need to keep making projects, I just want to work on projects because they're more interesting.
I'll think about it.
(Random conversation change) How does Video Art sound?. As an elective?
You make art using video.. It's the same professor that teaches Stop Motion Animation, so I think I could make an animation in the class if I wanted to.. It would likely be an easy class.
I think it's something related to the amount of financial aid that I'll receive.
I think so.
I'll look into it further.
I am no longer eligible for work study if I'm only part-time. I suppose that's not the worst thing, but my father did want me to do that.
Full-time students are given priority for financial aid.
Not really.
It's based on available funds.
I know. I'll keep looking into it.. I'll discuss it with my father when he comes home.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Have another great day tomorrow.
Thanks. I'll try to use it wisely.. Surprises sound nice.. Tah tah for now.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg3_eyDHuF8. Good morning.
Just rolling out of bed?
I hope that starts your day off nicely!. I love you, Leandra!
Have a great day!. Neat video game art!. Thank you for including me in your day!!
Well I'm happy to be on your mind and in your thoughts if only for a moment.
Because it was for two moments?!?!?. Wow! You've got some nice compositions!. And the lighting in the first picture is really good!. Wow!. Double wow!. I like the framing over the city.. And the food looks great!. I had a bowl of cereal, so I'm having fancy meals as well.
It was Great Grains :P. (between you and me, I'd call it Good Grains). I need to learn how to cook fish to perfection!. Then you might keep my around!
All of the people area actually controlled by rats?!?!. Just kidding :P. I would probably think the same thing!. I hope you continue to have a great day. I have some errands to run, but I'll talk to you when I get the chance.
We'll see! I've got to head to Radford to drop off my packaging designs. That's the most important thing I have to do.
Thanks! I'll try to make it out unscathed.. (hug). Goodnight and sweet dreams for later!. I love you!
You'll have to show me some time!. And suspenders could be nice-- I've worn them a few times.. I hope you're as excited for your present as I am to give it to you!. You don't have to get me suspenders unless you're dying to see me wear them.. (That's not to say I wouldn't like them, but that you could spend your time better than shopping for suspenders!)
There were four? A black pair, a tannish pair, an odd looking one, and a black with white accents pair-- from what I saw.. Good morning, beautiful!. I'm a bit partial to either black or tan (you know, the boring, but safe ones). Goodnight.
Oh! How was your day?
It wasn't so great, but that's okay.
Nothing really.. I'm glad to hear from you.
I guess I didn't get to do much that I wanted to.. Sleep tight.
I hope you have a nice day tomorrow.. Sweet dreams.
I wasted my time trying to fix my mechanical pencil which resulted in failure. I guess I regret not using my time better.
Maybe.
That's good.
Best friends forever!
You should form a group! You can meet up and eat croissants.
Sushi isn't native to France :P
Well that's good.. Pictures will have to do for me.. When is the last day of the class?
Sounds like fun. You should go to them.. I hear New Zealand is nice. Especially if you're a fan of Lord of the Rings.. (And even if you aren't)
And then your mom is coming to have fun with you?
Good luck finding both of those things!
That sounds like a lot of fun. Eneas even invited me to Germany for fun times there.
Oh, that doesn't necessarily mean I can go.
I don't have money to go.
I think that's more than the adventure fund.
You'll have to go hiking every other day just to keep it together.
Sounds great.
Want what?
Where are you learning Japanese?. I'm not sure if I'll have a job that will allow for such a life.
Do you have links to the downloads?
I'm glad.. You should be happy.
I'm glad I can help making you happy.. And I'm glad you found good company to travel with.
I thought the people you were with were good company.
I'm sure. I'm hoping to have $1200 at the end of every month when I have a job.
I hope it works that way.
That's true. I was going to put money aside at least.
I looked up the lower end of income for graphic designers and it pays about $708 per week. I'll try to get a cheap apartment for around $700 a month. And food might be $200 or so.
I think the income is after taxes.
Okay.. Goodnight. Excuse me for keeping you up.
Oh, not your bad.. You're great.. I'm happy that you wanted to talk to me.. Good morning.
Have a great day, Leandra!
I'll try my best.. It's nice catching you.. For as fleeting as the moment may be.
Hello!
My day is okay.. That sounds like a fancy dinner! I hope you have a great time.
That's a funny way of putting it.
I'll look into it.. I've never heard of it before :P
Tah tah for now.. Okay, so it's a less formal way to eat food-- from what I'm gathering.. I'm missing you.
Exciting.
Watching my grandmother.. I am lacking motivation to work on projects though.
I would rather work on my projects.. I'm just not seeing any inspiration/motivation.. I like talking to you though.
I'll look forward to then.
Oh. Okay.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I don't know what the FIAP cat is.. Regardless, it's quite a lucky cat.
Wow.. and you're comfortable enough to cuddle with it?. This food is going to get you spoiled.
I'm glad you can appreciate life!. Sleep tight to you too.. I'm also glad that you have the opportunity to be spoiled.. Sweet dreams.
I love you too!. Still cuddling a cat?. I'm going to assume you are not.. Because cats are finicky creatures.. But if you are, then have a nice time!. http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/. I haven't gotten to involved into this-- and I'm sending it based on its superficial merit, but I thought I would send it to you anyway.. I'll look into it further, of course, and I will give you the "low down". There is also an app called "Memrise". I'll look into that too!. Good morning!
Oh-- okay.. I'll try to be more help next time.. I hear this is a good resource: http://www.amazon.com/Minna-Nihongo-Book-Bk-Japanese/dp/4883191028/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1413641580&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=%E3%80%8C%E3%81%BF%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E3%80%8D+minna+no+nihongo. I suppose you could use other means to attain these books :P
Have a great last day of class!. Good luck on the paper you have to write.
Of course.. Have fun with your mom and everything.. When will she be arriving?
Sounds great!. I hope that's fun (not that it won't be!)
Instead of what?. I worked on a few things, but I mostly helped my grandmother.. If that's what you were asking.. When you were trying on training pants, you determined you wore a small, right?. Goodnight.
I will assume a small.
What is it?
Sounds amazing-- in fact... too good to be true!
Seems great.. Are you going to show your mother the same restaurants, or are you going to try to find something new for the both of you to enjoy?
I was thinking that would be a good idea.
Well I'm sure you can handle it.
In French?
I wasn't aware there were sections.. Don't you think optometry is a bit bland for Paris?
Couldn't that be applicable to traveling in general?
You can keep talking to me-- sometimes just talking about what you have to do will eventually give you a pretty good answer.
Not a problem.
That's good. Are you going to keep in touch?
Looks like you'll have to start using snapchat.. I really don't know :P
Unless you've already.
I wish I had a snapchat to see those.. Except they're probably personalized to the specific recipient.
I'm definitely missing out then.. Goodnight.. Sleep well.
Sweet dreams, Leandra.
No, why?
I guess I'm not so cool then.
You're throwing a rave to My Chemical Romance?. I'm sure people will enjoy it.. They may even bring their own glowsticks.
Just don't forget the strobe lights.
You too.. It's okay if you want to keep jamming out to middle school memories.. N' whatnot.. Have fun.
The good ol' days, when I wasn't a part of them :P
Of course. Goodnight.. Just reminds me of sad things.
What makes me uncomfortable?
Multiple boys?
There's more than one?
I didn't know there was more than one.
:/
Not fun for me.
Definitely not forgotten.. I feel like it's not though.
I still don't think you want me.
If you say so.. Goodnight.. You've never told me about Max before.. I'm not the person that you want. The person you want is muscular and very intelligent.. Anyway... It appears that the Condivo 14 pants are all sold out in women's small, but you can find a men's x-small still, so that may be the only option.. I doubt they would be something you could find in a thrift store.
I will stop then. Goodnight.
Good morning. Say hello to your mother for me-- if it comes up.. Keep me informed whether or not my services are needed at your house.. I'll be honest and say that I'm feeling very "down in the dumps". It's probably loneliness getting the better of me.
One in particular that I'm after.. I guess I haven't felt wanted in some time.. I've tried to keep distracted by cleaning these boots here-- although the boots are rather tall, you can only clean boots for so long.. I'll be sure to keep this to myself next time.. But in general-- yes, I don't have many human interactions.
Perhaps... but you don't have the time to hear things.. read*. I can't shake the feeling that I'm not the one you want. I want you to have the opportunity to find that person though.
Just from things you've said.. You've listed traits to your ideal partner, and I am not a fit.. of*. And I suppose I have felt that you don't care to talk-- I know that you're off in Paris, having a great time, but it makes me feel unwanted.. That's not your fault-- of course. Just overthinking.. Well... I'll let you get on with your day. Have a good one.. You probably don't know how to respond to these things-- either that, or you don't want to. I understand. I apologize for bringing them up.. I've heard it said not to go to bed on a heavy heart.... Sorry for giving you my problems.
I apologize for that too.. What was your last message?. I'm going to sleep I suppose.. Have a nice day.
I have to enroll as part-time which involves filling some forms out.. I'll keep it in mind.. Is there anything that you need of me?. I can collect mail for your mother, I can water her plants, and etcetera.. Maybe you need me to do something for you.. Your boots should be ready for you when you ever arrive to Blacksburg.. Also-- did you want me to sign up for TechHacks and MCHacks too?
That's quite a ways away.. Would you like for me to be part of your team?. Or will I only get in your way?. Also-- to answer the first comment-- I haven't polished them yet, but they are clean. Would you like for me to go ahead and polish them?
Just have to hope that they fit.. You can also use me off site as your graphic designer. When are the dates? Hopefully they don't conflict with anything.. The boots look nice though-- they were a little dirty, but I cleaned them right up. I'm still debating whether or not to polish them to make them look spick and span.. (I'll be right back)
I cannot find TechHacks.. But I found https://mchacks.io/
Oh, that's fine.. McHacks is only 2 days?. Should I sign up as part of your team?
I don't want to be on another team.
Learning Japanese would be cool. I promised myself that I would finish two poems and the game development document.. What category are you most interested in?
Silly poems.
My poetry isn't very good.
Do you happen to recall my "website" url?. my.ru seems to be having server errors.. And I can't find it.. How did you sign up for McHacks if it doesn't recognize US universities?. Well-- It doesn't recognize those that are as south as we are.
The form.. Is what "it" is.. Thanks.. I thought that I needed a homedir in there somewhere.. You need to leave your friend a message saying that you will be back at 10pm, but all you have are prescription glasses, an extra sock, and ice. How do you do it?. These are the real questions we need to be asking people.. To justify why I thought I needed the "homedir" in the url, is because that is how I put the website into a folder, which I then need to update my web permissions. I can reach the website through the longer url, I just forgot the I could use the shorter one.
I said I would leave my glasses, so my friend knew the urgency of the situation. I would spell out "10pm" out of the ice, so that when it melts it will still say "10pm" in water. And if those solutions don't work, then I'll leave the sock in their chair, and my friend should just know what that means.
What did you put?
Is that what you put?
You would sacrifice your vision to tell your friend you're going to be back soon?
You're sacrificing someones glasses?. How are they supposed to see/. ?*. What if the glasses belong to your friend?. I was thinking in the scenario that the glasses were mine, but I suppose your approach is outside the box.
That phrase seems out of character for you.
If you can't see for the rest of the night, I wouldn't think they would be.. (And if someone else couldn't see for the rest of the night, I suppose that's not your problem.". )*
Everyone knows MacGyver always carries a paper clip and some string, and somehow crafts it into an explosive.
But the scenario is all wrong, because where's the paper clip?!?. Probably just forgot it in his pocket.... But that doesn't sound like something he would do. I'm pretty sure he just has a supply store hidden in his vest.. Would you like for me to polish the boots?. Since they're clean?
Okay. And then I can polish them while they're on your feet.
I'll give ya a righ' good shinin' missus. I'll only charge ye a pence for et!. Honestly I wouldn't mind though.. As long as you had a chair, and I had a lower elevation.. It would be much easier to shine on a person than it was for me to hold it.
I haven't a poem yet.. I can show you. You'll likely need an on and off brush (that's two brushes). Both of which are likely at my house.. (And I'm sure neither are being used, so you're free to them as long as you give them a good home). And there's some polish at my house as well.. I am ready and willing to read a poem though.
Sounds nice.
Wow.. Who owns the eyes you're reminded of?. And so many secrets?. These are nice. Sounds like I owe you 3 poems.
I had hoped they were mine. Maybe you were thinking of me :P
Maybe-- but probably not.. I'll be sure to write 10 poems so I can trade with you.
As you should be.. You should make a poetry book.. I can lay your poems out on a page, design a cover, print and bind them. It'll be good practice for my publications class.. Just a thought-- it's not necessary.
I can make it digital-- but a printed copy isn't very hard. Especially if it's just stapled (saddle-stitched)
It sounds like an order with a questionmark at the end.
Is this something he wanted?
Also.. Do you have an image of the Eiffel tower for me?. Is this something the students wanted?. Or is this something you wanted?
And it's supposed to be funny?
Am I supposed to make the image of him look better?. It's really grainy, and the lighting is off.
What's the last image for?
One is inside the Eiffel Tower?
I can do the other if you don't like it.
What do you mean?
I don't have a selfie stick.. Oh... I see it.. I didn't realize it was integral to the image.. Oops.. I forgot to apply the color corrections.
You're sweet.
Is that all you wanted?. Sorry for the compliment. You're probably tired of them.
If you say so.. Poor Sam.. getting cropped.. You look nice.
the ":P" makes me feel like the compliment is unwanted.. I can stop.
Sure.. I like it when you're flattered.
or when it makes you happy.. with a ":$". Or ":3". I'm glad you think she's awesome.. Befriend her and steal some of her awesome.. Or.. let it rub off on you. (Not that you need to be any more awesome than you already are.)
It's fine.. Don't forget about your other awesome friends. Can't leave them out.
In Paris? That's kind of funny.. But I'm sure it's "good" Chinese food.
Isn't your paper due sooner?. I honestly don't know though.. I'm going to go. Bye for now.. I love you.. Unless you don't want me to.
Sometimes I need a reminder.. When is everything else due?. People recommend watching Japanese television, when you're trying to learn Japanese.. What is MyMaps?. I looked it up, and I'm still not sure.
And when do you have to work on Linear Algebra?
Well you've got time!. I'd say your map and your essay are the most important things on your list.. Or at least they are due the soonest.. I wouldn't put off the essay. I would recommend writing it as soon as you can so that you don't stress about it too much on Monday (or even Tuesday). Then you have more time to spend with your mom.. Then again, I shouldn't be the one giving you advice, because you already know what to do.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. How was your Chinese food?
That's good.. I'll refrain from talking now.
That's a bit of an exaggeration.. As a joke, I'm sure.
I wouldn't be offended.. It was quick.. Are you sure you're happy with your relationship?. Did you get accepted into McHacks?. This is so you know how later on.. And if you really want these, this may be your best option (in an x-small). I think those are a few of the last things you need from me.. If you need me for anything else, let me know. Other wise, I'll leave you with that.
Goodnight.
Looks good.. I don't have anything like that to show you.. I'm not happy.. I feel like we aren't talking as much and when we do, I can never tell what you're thinking, because it's just words on a computer screen.
You don't have to do anything different.. And you wanted to be a graphic designer? What changed your mind? You should have!. I'm not a fan of the "thumbs up" It always looks condescending.
Good morning.. Or afternoon.. So what I do is dull>. ?*. That's okay.
Are you hanging out with your mother yet?. Have a good time.. Goodnight and sweet dreams for later.. There's going to be a Studio Management class offered this semester.. Might be a useful skill.. The silence and rare replies just remind of the time you left me in the dark. You ended up breaking my heart. I fear that you would do it all over again, but return saying you still need a friend. My heart is far from mended, and this time apart makes me wish it were ended.
Just how I am feeling.. Three hours studio: (3)  Hour and fifteen minute lecture, meeting twice a week, with a guest lecturer* every other week.  This course deals with studio art as a business and a personal enterprise. Special attention is given to the logistics of running a studio, personal branding, writing proposals, art safety, the value of art, researching venues, presentation of artworks and careers in the arts.  Students will engage with the material through readings, presentations, demonstrations and guest lecturers. The student will respond through writings, group discussions, a group show (sourced and advertised by the student), presentations and formal assessments. Upon completion of this course the student will have a basic understanding of the studio practice as a business enterprise.
The professor is one of the art professors, I'm assuming the guest lecturers are the ones who run studios themselves. Not sure what the art studio contains, but it promises a show with collective work of students in the class. Paris with your mom sounds fun. I'm glad you're having a good time. My days have been bleak.
I thought it was a place where you make your art. Art sales likely, and I think proposals are what you write before you start on a piece.
It could get rejected.
I'm interested in illustration and graphic design.
I'm not sure how it works-- that's why you take the class. I'm assuming you write a proposal to ensure your work is original in some way.
I'm guessing someone is out there to approve it.
I suppose.. Okay-- so proposals is usually for funding and commissions.. That makes sense.. I thought it involved a ring, but that must be something else.. Just kidding.
Of course.. You'll likely see many types in your life.
We lost a great musician.. And overall person.
I knew about the new album. He had a recent music video for one of his songs too.. Lost one of my favorite musicians, but that doesn't compare to his family and close friends.. So I hope they are doing okay during this time.
Is that what you're doing?. An actual friend, or David Bowie?
Sounds like you've grown obsessed :P
That makes sense.. Be sure to keep in touch with them if they mean so much to you.
Sounds nice. Seems like you've got things planned for a while.. Doesn't sound like I fit in those plans though.. Which is fine. It appears that it has gotten fairly late for you. Goodnight. Sleep well.
It's fine. You don't need me around.
Same thing that's been wrong.
That and lack of interactions from you.. And it looks like you're planning to stay away as much as you can.
You've got so many plans that don't involve me. It feels like you don't need me in your life at all.
It seems like you would do fine without me.. The plans that involve me, could be done alone.. Or with someone else.
There's nothing a provide someone else couldn't.. I* provide.. There's no reason for you to keep me around.
I'm not unique. And there are so many qualities you would rather have.
I don't think it's that simple.
If you insist.. I'll let you get to sleep. Goodnight.
We can talk, but I don't know what to say.
I would like to spend more time with you.. But that's not going to happen.
You don't have to go out of your way. I can always be your ride though.. I'm up for scuba diving, but I'm still worried that I'll die.. It didn't feel all that great when we did it before, and that was in a small pool.
Perhaps.. I have to leave the computer for a while, and by the time I get back, you will likely be tired. Feel free to go to sleep.
Sweet dreams to you too.
It's due tomorrow!. Good luck. I hope it's easier than it will be.. Bye for now.
I haven't been up to anything. Watching my grandmother from time to time.. How's the wine?. Good morning, insert endearing compliment here!
Do you still want compliments?. Or would it be off-putting to call you "lovely" "cute" "beautiful" "cutie pie" so on
What does "qui" mean?. Does that mean "Yes"? and that it would be off-putting?. I can stop.. I love you, Leandra. Have a great day today.. Je vous aime.
Oh-- I'm not familiar with French.
I'll keep that in mind!
Thank you! I might be up for a bit, because I had a late night snack.
It was waffles and hashbrowns.. The event that preceded that odd choice is that I was spending time with Gap and Bowen, and they wanted to go to Waffle House.
Oh-- It was recent.. I got back from Waffles and Hashbrowns around 2ish
It was good.. I miss your company quite a bit though.. I'll work on not missing you so much.. The last thing you want is someone to be so needy.. I hope your day will be great.
Eventually we'll be so busy, it won't even be like we're in a relationship.
Doesn't seem so to me.. The way I see it is that you're going to have your own job across the country, and I won't even see you and you'll be so busy that I won't get to talk to you.. Then we won't even know each other.
I'm starting to feel like it.. I think I'd rather have a job near you than to have my dream job far away.
But it sounds like-- in the future, you want to live in a separate place, with jobs far away from each other.. Your dream job is just as important to consider.
Then I live alone for a year, and then you'll hang out for bits at a time?. That's what that translates to.. Which is okay, I suppose.
I know. So I'll be living in my own place for a year longer than you.
Okay.. I won't waste any more of your time today.. Bye for now.. I was curious about the wine earlier, because it's difficult to say no to the French.. And they may have persuaded you.
Are you online? I'm confused as to how you've vanished, yet you're still messaging me.. Ireland?. That sounds pretty neat.
I guess so.. I'll have to figure out where to apply.. I have two video games in mind as projects-- but I don't have the coding know how.
But I want it to be playable.
I suppose that's true-- but I don't have any way of making a playable game without the coding.
I don't think I know any that could devote the time.
I would also be worried about giving out my stuff to people that I don't trust.. That's a silly fear though.
I will look into it.. Anyway, I shouldn't distract you from Paris.. Enjoy the city of love.. I love you. Have a good time.
Good luck on the paper!. I'll wait to sleep until this room heats up.. A bit chilly for my tastes.. I'm available for any calls you would like to make.. I hope you're not too tired from all the laps you've run inside my head.
I wanted to say that all that running would make you too tired to write-- but the internet wasn't being cooperative.. Anyway, I'm warming up a lil' more.
(hug). Are hugs okay?
Okay!. (hug)(hug). (hug) was the last thing I sent you on skype.
I've noticed.. What? This isn't spotify.. Oops. I have made a grave mistake.. I'm going to sleep now. Goodnight. Enjoy your lunch.
Nothing to thank me for.. I hope your day has been really nice!. Just checking in on you! Wanted to say how wonderful you are, and that I love you. Keep doing what you're doing.
Oh you know me.. Just all about you!. How goes the paper?
That's great.. I guess it was easier than it would be.
My day is okay. I stayed the night in Radford, so I woke up there.
I helped Jessica on her poetry books (cutting, folding, and stapling) since I was there.. Then I drove home.
I was spending time with Gap and Bowen yesterday.. Bowen lives in Radford, so we were doing homework things there.. We explored the new science building.. Which was pretty cool.
Kind of-- just projects and things.. The building was nice. I think we explored it a little too much though :P. Wandered in places we were likely not allowed in :P. I need to do a better job of keeping myself busy/distracted.. Anyway.. goodnight.
Just one rooftop.
It was the science building, so there were a lot of skeletons and organ standees.. So lots of bodies.. And the view was nice.. It was really cold up there though.. Anyway, goodnight sleepy head.
That's good!. I'm glad you found those.
I'm not familiar with the video.. Is something wrong with Kanji?. Where did you find Genki?
Makes sense.. I'll try to learn with you.. (I'm all signed up to Memrise and everything). I don't have the book though.
I don't know anyone Japanese.. I can try on my own.
(I don't think I can.). Goodnight.. Sleep well.. I love you.. Good morning.
Yeah. Have you heard of him before?. I thought it could tell a story.. I hope you slept well.. Have a great day.
Doesn't every story?. I'll see. My bed hasn't invited me in yet.. I think it's upset, because I slept in a different bed last night.
A story always has an ending though.. Have a nice breakfast.. I hope the sunrise looks nice over the Eiffel Tower (unless it rises behind you :P). Then you've got the sunset to look forward to.. I feel like I type so much, and facebook says you've "seen" it, but then I don't get a response. I should probably type less.
I apologize then.. The sunrise sounds great.. Staying up and watching the sunrise would be nice.. Have a great day. Bye for now.. I hope your day has gone swimmingly.. I thought you might find these cute.. Especially the second one.
Okay, good. I've accomplished what I set out to do.
My day is going alright.. How is your day going?
That's good.
That's great!. I should probably keep up.. How far along are you?
Sounds great so far!. Keep up the good work.
Is that so? I really should be keeping up then!
I think it is.. It would really help if traveling to Japan.
I'm sure.. Just have to learn both.. Anyway. I'm glad to hear you had a good day. Maybe you can give me some details on what you did. Goodnight and sweet dreams (for now or for later, whenever you decide to sleep)
Where did you find an option to download it?. I'm still looking for it.. I hope you don't mind, but I went ahead and collected mail at your house. There was a package at the door, and the mailbox was getting full.
I can use it on the web. I guess I don't need to download it unless I knew I wasn't going to have access to the internet.. And it's not a problem. Let me know when other packages arrive and I can take them in. Otherwise, I thought I would wait another three days (unless you want me to go every day)
Wow. You're so fast.
And I'll try for Saturday, because post doesn't come Sunday :P
Genki is available on Memrise, if you didn't notice.
Okay, just checking.. Oh? Any advice you would give to someone who wishes to learn Japanese?
I'll keep that in mind.. Have a great night. Sleep well.
I guess it's a good thing to be addicted to.
Neato.
Wow. That was fast.
Good job!. Good luck continuing your endeavor. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Have some good ones. Not just about sweet pancakes or cannoli.. But those kinds are fine too :P
If you want me in those dreams, that's cool too.
I'll do my best.. Sweet dreams, Cutie.. Adidas is sold out of Condivo 12 training pants in a women's small, but I have found a few websites that have them (not certain how reputable they are and they would be for around $40). Condivo 14* I meant to type 14 :P. Still the option of a men's x-small or you could try a youth large :P
It's tough, because I think they've been discontinued.. Is that too much? I can calm down.
Just songs and cute things I thought you might like.. Like-- maybe this thing will remind Leandra how cute she thinks I am.. Or not.. there's no guarantee.
Probably not on the second thing :P. Anyway-- good morning.
How'd you sleep?. I'm starting to feel like you don't find me very cute anymore.
I'm glad it was just a dream.. I'm assuming you're in agreement with my previous statement.. How do silver training pants sound? I know they're not black, but they're in the size you would need them.. Oops-- they're in a men's small.. My apologies.. Well... have a nice day.. What are your plans?
Sounds good.. Are you ignoring parts of things that I say?
That you no longer find me cute.. It's okay if you don't.
I guess I'm finding reasons for you to not want me anymore. Which I suppose I have. I worry that you've found someone in France-- perhaps. I think I just need you to tell me that it's all okay, but I have trust issues.
Okay.. Have a good time.. I'm sorry for acting the way I have been.
I don't know. I remember you being excited to talk to me, and that you couldn't wait to tackle me and give me hugs. But I haven't been getting that "vibe" from you.. But maybe growing up does that to you, and I shouldn't expect those things and grow up too.
Sounds like they've switched from love tackles, to kill tackles.. Also sounds like you're still itching to wrestle.. Which I obviously mean by "self-defense". Because that's definitely something useful for you to learn. I've recuperated from the last time we battled.. But you also never really confirmed whether or not you still found me cute.. It doesn't matter.. I'll get to sleep now. Have a nice day.. It's just... you've stopped giving me compliments and you constantly refer to me as "dude." It doesn't feel like the way a person treats the person their in a relationship with.. I just feel like you're talking to Edward/Lawrence again. Which is okay, you can do that, but I think we should stop talking if that's the case.
It makes me want to talk to you less.. Maybe it's for the best.. I'll leave you with goodbye then. Have a nice day.. I feel like I shouldn't have said that.. I'm sorry. You can talk to anyone you want to. My feelings shouldn't matter in this matter.. And now I'm finding trouble falling to sleep.. I thought that you would talk to me when you wanted to, so I'll be waiting for that moment.
Good afternoon.. That looks cool. Have a good rest of your day.. And after that rest, have a good day.. Because rest means to relax.. I'll see myself out.
That sounds cute.. Probably because it's a cute girl feeding cute birds.. "It" being the scene I'm imagining.
I have one pair in navy blue.. It's not the nicest, but I was probably too late to give an answer, so don't worry about it.
That's great. Now you can watch all of the Japanese movies without subtitles!. I'm okay. How are you?
I guess you can still have your subtitles then.. Anyway. I'm glad you had a good day. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I hope you have another nice day tomorrow.
Thanks.
I will check it out.
Whoa... you've really spruced up the place.
Well I really love the decor. Is that... mahogany?. I'm just up to my usual self. Except I'm up pretty early. I have my driver improvement class today. What are you up to?
Oh, yes. I suppose the greenish hue is the giveaway.
I love you too. I hope you do that same.. the*. My hands are tired.. But not me. I'm as awake as a whistle.. Or a kazoo, because those make zzz sounds.
Whoa... shut the front door and lock the house because we're going away for a prolonged period of time and wouldn't want to come home to find racoons have made their way with the kitchen.
Oh.. it's just another way of saying "Get out" or "no way"
I'll try. I hope I signed up for the right one. Thanks so much. Bye, Leandra. Have a great time today.. I love you, and I hope you're excited for surprises that I haven't told you about, but now I have, and you'll have that to think about all day. "What did he get me?" Well you'll find out!. But not right now, because it's a secret!
Tah tah for now.. Don't let it distract you too much from your day. Just think about it every now and then and know that you're loved and that I'm thinking about you.. I got your mail. One of them said "L. Irvine" which could mean it's for you, or your mother-- I assumed you, so I'm hoping I'm right. The porch light was on, which may have been on purpose, or I may have accidentally turned it on the last time I collected mail. Either way, I turned it off-- but I can turn it back on if it was on purpose.. Also-- I am willing to take you to Charlottesville, if no other rides exist. I thought I could drop off my certificate from today at the vasap office in Lexington on the way (I can always mail it, but this way I ensure it gets to them)
I was informed I need to take it to where it needs to go.
We were given a physical certificate.
Maybe it's new.. I don't know. I was just told I need to present the certificate to the vasap office.. Since the office is monitoring me. :P. I had hoped that I could see you, and that my offer would be pretty enticing too.
A really long time.. But okay. It would likely just be harder on you.
Sounds worth it to me.. Drove even further than that, if you don't recall.
I can't, because I'm late for choosing that option.. I'll try to find a 1 credit class.. Maybe a self defense class?
Like Video Art.
I have to officially claim that I'm part time.. And it's not certain that I will receive funding as part time.
Thanks. Goodnight.. I'll figure things out.. Have a great day tomorrow. Is it your last one?
Oh. Okay. I hope your last day was great then.. Have a nice flight.. I just signed up for Watercolor 1. Fitting that you'd have that dish escargot.. And that looks cool! Much better than just two in the bush.. (escargot=as you go)
Goodnight.. Watercolor will be an 8am class.. Sweet dreams.. Wow-- impressive progress.
Like I said-- I was cheating. So I can't promise that's what it is.
Google tells me that is "no"
Use no instead?
I don't know what that means.. I guess it's like "no problem". Like slang?
or "no need". I have not been.
Bye.. I hope to see you February 14th.. But it's not terribly important.. Sleep tight.
I don't know what jaa mata means either.. I'm guess "see you". guessing*. I won't keep you up any more. Goodnight.. I think the picture of you with the bird could be your new profile picture.. Good morning.
Reverse Fresh Prince!. I guess you're more like a Princess though.. I hope you have safe travels.
It is really cool.. Hello there.
How are you?. I'm sure you're very tired. Don't mind me. I'll let you sleep. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Wow. It actually applies to me now :P. Just kidding, but it is an oddity after all that time.. I love you. See you around.. Unless you don't want to, that's fine too.
The oddity is being able to say sweet dreams, and it be the appropriate time to go to sleep :P. I like the marshmallow wonderland!
Good morning!. How is your day progressing so far?
I'm going to be silly and do my grocery shopping on Tuesday to save 5%. But I'll be sure to make a list as well.. I am. Spring Commencement is May 7th.. Which means that is my last day.. Do you still want to open a joint account together?
Yeah-- that's what I was thinking. I was going to ask before I did anything with it.. I can put it in the bank tomorrow, and transfer it to you?
Okay. we do have the money from the adventure fund.
It's $1000+. That might not be enough though.
Skydiving sounds terrifying, but we can go.
Okay. Cool. Banks are closed today, which is why I'm waiting for tomorrow.
The fund probably could have been more, so I'm sorry for that.
I have a bunch of coins, which would take a while.. They have an automated sorter.. I'll try to be healthy.. Don't you worry about that.
Okay. I'll put the money into the bank, then transfer it to Capital One.. I'll receive a receipt for it too, so I can toss that into the elephant jar.
I'll try to get things done before my 10:30am class.
Watercolor MW 1:00pm-3:15pm Publication Design MW 3:50pm-6:00pm Portfolio Prep TR 10:30am-12:45pm Twentieth Century Art TR 2:00pm-3:15pm Senior Graphic Design Project (At all times). What's yours?
I do have a calendar view version. I don't think the "sign-in pin" is the same as the pin I use when making purchases-- unless it is, but I thought that was the one I needed to get in the mail.. Have a safe trip. I hope you also have an awesome day. I also hope that almond butter is on sale :P. You know.. just in case you're feeling like treating yourself :P
That sounds good too-- though if you had the food processor with you, then you could have both.. It doesn't look like much of a calendar, but it's there :P
No problem.. Anything for you :P
I have a gmail account, you can always try to use dropbox.. Unless you don't.. But email is usually alright. I can wait until I see you next, and I can give you a usb to transfer it to.
I'm at justsomepita@gmail.com. How has your day been?. I mean-- I heard you got almonds, so it's probably great.
I helped make lasagna.
Home is where the heart is :P
No meat. It was layers of ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella, tomato sauce, spinach, carrots and pasta.. Meat would have been met well though, I'm sure.
Charlottesville of all places?. That's definitely something you shouldn't miss.. I unfortunately have class until 6pm on Wednesdays.. So I don't think I can make it.
I would go with you if it were any other day!. Like... Friday for example. I'm pretty free those days.
And for any events that you want me at.. I'm down for anything!
Like I said before... It sounds terrifying, and I'll be terrified, but if you want to, we can do it.
Yeah. Scott said he could teach me how-- he wants to teach Jessica too, so as long as we coordinate, we should be good.
So I will do my best!. You want to scuba dive and skydive?. Or you want to do them at different times?. Because whichever is okay.
Okay. Sounds good.. Time for lasagna!. It's pretty good :P. I'm about to head over to Radford. Goodnight and sweet dreams for later.. Oh! When should I return the key to your mother? I can run over tonight if that works!
Thanks. I'll do my best.. I love you.
(hug). Sweet dreams.. I just counted and the total is ~$1100.. $1099 if the Wells Fargo dollar doesn't count as a dollar :P. I'm a bit surprised that I had an even number of coins :P. Goodnight!
I can do that.
Thanks.. I hope you have a great day too.. Oh. I don't have a UVa computing ID.
justsomepita@gmail.com
Okay.. Wow. More swing dancing?
Are you going?
Wow! What are you up to?
Makes sense, as it's Tuesday.. I saw a pair of figure skates at the goodwill, but they were a size 6.. I thought they would have been a nice gift though, had they been a proper size.. Have fun. Bye for now.
I think of you nonstop :P. They were white.. They were in a Canadian size-- I think 9.. But that's a 6 in U.S. sizes.
I'll keep those in mind.
Especially in mind when you do live close to a frozen lake.. Who knows where you'll live in the future :P. Wow-- ice skates aren't as expensive as I thought they would be. At least-- not the used ones.. Good morning.. The bank in Radford does not have a coin counter, but the one in Blacksburg does. I've put a portion into the bank, but we can wait to make any transfers on Friday/Saturday.
Thank you!. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.. Your schedule is a mystery at the moment.... it's like you're off the radar!. Laying low... like you've... done something!!!. You can remove the file now. It finished downloading-- it failed the first time, and took a long time the second time.. Just though I'd tell you.
Ooh! I'll check that out.
My red backpack has already been outside of the country.
Oh.. I guess that's pretty neat.
I'm down.. Or up.. Both :P
Sounds like a lot of fun.
Sounds great.
Can't wait.. I am done for the day.. Well-- with classes at least.. I just noticed I rhymed before :P
I was thinking I'd get started on homework.. I can do anything you would like me to do though.
Yeah, I'm not dude.. The adventure fund can help?
That sounds like a lot of fun.
So I've heard.
It makes a lot of sense.. Gap was saying the same thing the other day.. Positive you want me as your travel companion?
Really?
You had me going there.
I feel like you have a lot of options.. Not at all.
Of course not.. That's one of the best parts.
For food? I guess that depends on how expensive food is.
We could get some $5 Bento boxes :P. And battle for them?
It's your standard over the top anime.
Probably because of cute boys. Obviously :P. Just kidding, of course.. I'm always available to watch it with, if you would like.
Haha... Half a bathroom :P. That looks nice.. I've never stayed on a boat before.. It only has one bed though. Will that be a problem?
It's not a problem for me. I was just thinking you may not like it.
That's fine.. Kind of like when we were camping.
You'd prefer a separate bed?
And that one specifically has a kayak.. Yeah. That sounds nice.
I guess that puts a damper on things.. Unless it doesn't? :P
That sounds good.. Especially if you want some quiet time :P
I'm not sure yet.. I will think about it.
Animals are nice.. That looks like fun
That would be safe.
That sounds good.
I see a horse in the logo. Does this mean horse riding?. I'm ready to discover mysteries!
I'd like to see an armadillo.. My kind of place is a place with you.
That sounds fine.. Sorry for being sappy.
Manatees in the tough life?. Doesn't sound so tough with those cuties swimming around.
And the treasure hunting?
We could forage for our food!
And hunting for mushrooms.. And squirrel.. Maybe not squirrel.
Definitely.. I'll do some research before purchase.. There was a yahoo article saying that Kosovo, Albania, Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania were nice locations to visit that were affordable.
They were "underrated". But Albania is where Eneas is from, so you know.. it's got something going for it :P. I was reading something that the newer redbird backpacks weren't made as well as some older models.. I should also see my mothers collection of backpacks first.
Okay, I will do the same after I check with the ones already in my family's possession.. And he could always want to visit Albania.. And I sort of meant that it's a good country based on the merit of one person from it, though I know that's not the case.
3/4 is a Friday?. I don't have classes on Fridays.. On 3/3 I'm done with classes at 3:15pm.. So you can have me a few extra days :P
You can have me immediately after that class.
I mean-- I can drive over and pick you up.
If that's what you want.. I can pack things for you?. Maybe stuff you want from Blacksburg?
I'm pretty free on Thursday :P
Okay. Let me know then.
I can do that.. We can discuss the "menu" later.
If you'd like. We can bring sleeping bags.. The black sleeping bag I have is pretty thick.. It would probably keep us warm through the night.
Not at night.. It can drop to a pretty cold temperature. Especially in a vehicle, which doesn't retain heat all that well.. I know from experience.
Are you saying no to the sleeping bag?
I know what that means, but you make it sound like 40 degrees isn't anything, we don't need a sleeping bag.. But I know you're going to want it.
Alright, sounds good.. That's fine. It might not be very good for our backs, but we'll just have to stretch a whole bunch.
Awesome. I'll copy this down.
Sounds fine.. kerfuffle. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
You?. You should take a break.
Anything you'd like to do.
Sweet dreams to you too.. Goodnight.. I should not have looked at my facebook history.... Now I'm just sad.. I miss you, but I think you've grown accustomed without me.. Which is okay. I can get along just fine without skype or phone calls. You don't have to text me any more either.
I have publication design as well.. Good morning.. Have a good time in CS 4730 :P
It is.
It's true.. It'll be a mystery to me.. Should I say.... Game design?!
I had to look it up.
Ni No Kuni Wrath of the White Witch.
Giving an example of a game to someone?
Interesting.. I'm definitely interested in game design.. I still have to find someone to help code the two games I want to make for my senior project.
I'm not sure.. It seems most people are too busy.. That I ask.
That's interesting.. I can provide sprites and graphics, if you like.
No problem.. I would be glad to help.. Have fun in... text mining?. At 5pm.... I guess you've got a bit of time before that.
Have fun with that.. I'm looking at the various projects, books, and readings I'm going to have to do and or get.
Unless I already have your class names :P. Watercolor seems like it's going to be nice.. Someone was talking about how nice the teacher is, and that she will teach you Chinese if you ask.
I think she'll only teach you bits during class.
But I can always ask.. You should take up fencing.
I'm sure.. Knowing how to sword fight is standard etiquette for a lady.
It is my duty as a gentleman.
I'm sure I could list a few-- but there are likely more than I know myself.. Honestly, I'm probably not good enough to be considered a gentleman.
I can't even get in to take the reexamination.. It's very exclusive.
https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top. I have to pick a book.
I just have to pick 1 from the 100 listed.. I have to read it, design the cover, design the layout, and make a minimum of 6 illustrations.. Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are both options.. But my professor says he is tired of looking at those.
I love you too!. Just 97 more balloons.... Wait-- 96 counting yours.. How easy is it for you to locate books?
Okay. Google hasn't been helping all that much.. I'll try the .eu one.
I need the book for the entire year.
It's a new class-- they aren't textbooks.. One book I want to buy, so that's okay-- but the other two I'm not sure about.. They're checked out at the moment.
Thanks, but we have reading due tomorrow.. Which surprised me.. I'll see if the google books preview has the appropriate pages.. I'll probably buy the books. No luck finding them online or on the .eu site.. Thanks though!. Someone may have been speaking incorrectly about the reading.
They said we had reading to do.. They may not be correct-- as I've checked the syllabus, and I haven't seen anything about having to read a chapter or anything.
I'm asking around to double check.. But I don't think I'll be able to do it regardless.. Anna Karenina is quite the wordy novel.
If I made it, you would like to read it?. Have a safe walk. I'm free for a call, if that makes you feel safer.
So if I design it, then you would like a copy?. How was the meeting?
Ooo.. Those are good markers.. I'm not sure about the whole snapchat thing anymore.. Maybe if there were a smartphone app, I could download it to it :P
Wait.. there's something called bluestacks.. Hello Beautiful!. Excuse me... I'm being silly.
Oh you know me...
I bet they're coming along.
I can still be your post whenever I'm nearby.
I can help you with those too.. You know.. if you want.. You know.. I should invest in hiking boots.. You should probably too.
I suppose-- but boot keep your toes safe.. boots*
So they'd be good!. Your toesies will thank you.. (hug). Okay. I have snapchat now.
Yes way.
Done.. Or.. I found you.. I think.
Cool!. I sent you something. Wow.. you have a score of 96?
I'm trying to respond to you, but it's not sending :P. There. I couldn't add any words :P. I had to hold my laptop over my face for that :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Might just have to get a smartphone to make this easier :P. I didn't get to see your reply for as long as I wanted and then it was gone forever.
I wasn't given the option.
They do role call and a head count.. I don't think I could sneak very well.. Plus they have a check in at PennApps to make sure I'm supposed to be there.. I don't think it will be very easy.
I can still provide graphics for you.
I mean.. it's okay if you want to replace me too.
Which part isn't serious?
I'm pretty sure I didn't contribute as much as you wanted me to.. How did you guys build it?. What would you want me to write instead?
Okay.. The deed is done.. Sorry for leaving it that way.
Have a great day.
Have a good time in Data Science Software. I think...
Wow.. wizard.... :O
Thanks-- no portfolio prep today though.. My class is really large, so he split it into Tuesday and Thursday groups. We're starting next week, and I'm in the Thursday group.. http://www.radford.edu/content/cvpa/home/news/Releases/feng-3.html. This looks great! I wish I took a class with Professor Feng.. Oh no.. PennApps is cancelled!. I'm sorry!
!!!. Yes.. Wow! How is she?. Probably going to be cold soon, after some snow angles.. Probably right ones.. And then some snow angels.. Goodnight.
Fun!. The dream team back together at last.. Enjoy the rest of the party.. It looks quite "happenin'". Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you.
Good morning!. Enjoy the snow!. There's so much to play in!. Wow... that party lasted forever!
That's good.. Hey... if you wanted, you could have your own hackathon.. You could call it "HackBlizzard" or "HackSnow" and then you could get some friends, maybe even Tanul if you wanted. And you could have fun times.. And for breaks, you can play in the snow.
Oh, okay! I just thought if it was something you really wanted to do, then it was possible.. I guess you can treat it like a Homeworkathon.. And for breaks you play in the snow. Pretty much the same thing I already said!
No more homework then!. :P. Do you guys have butter beer on hand?
Maybe some Burt's Jelly Beans?
Oops.. I haven't read/seen the movies in quite some time.. Here's a recipe for Butterbeer though:      Cream Soda     1 tsp Caramel Syrup     1 tsp Butterscotch Syrup     Heavy Whipping Cream. Then there's:      2 liter cream soda     2 tablespoons Butter extract     2 teaspoons rum extract    Cream topping      1 7oz container of marshmallow creme     1 cup whipping cream     1 teaspoon rum extract. But I understand that running to the store for said ingredients, would be difficult.. Maybe you have some chocolate frogs on hand?
It's all about the Harry Potter experience.. At the very least, you can put on a robe and a scarf.. And drink water out of a glass mug (I doubt you have those)
That will have to do.
The first one?. I haven't seen it in years!. Maybe we should have a Harry Potter Marathon as well.
I meant at this house-- since I can't do it with you.
I am not. I am in Radford.
I do have classes on Monday.. Which is why I stayed.. Enjoy magic today.
I love you too!. How's herbology going?. Or was that a different class?. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Oh.. so it was just Defense of the Dark Arts?. That doesn't sound like a very well rounded education.. You should discuss this with the headmaster.
Yep.. But then again.. I'm just a muggle, so what do I know?
I never received a letter in the mail, so yes.
I'm just not fortunate enough.
You too!. I hope you had a great day.. From what I heard, and saw it looks like you spent a fun wintery Harry Potter sledding marathon extravaganza.
I'm glad you had fun! Only four more to go.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you.
Wow.. Then that's just three left.. Happy Pie Day!!!!. You've gotta bake a pie today to celebrate!. Tell your housemates, and open a pie shop :P. Just kidding, of course.. I hope you're enjoying the snow. I would go out, but I don't have the appropriate attire to do so.
National Pie Day!
I don't have any boots.. My toes will fall off, and my shoes will get ruined!. I guess I don't have anyone to play with, which also hinders me from going outside.. It doesn't hinder me, but it's just not as fun.
If you have any 3D glasses lying around.... You could wear those.. Flannel is also big.. Converse and combat boots are also something.. You'll probably need a sock hat.. And an ironic mustache.. If you've got a jean jacket, I think they wear those too.. If you have a pair of suspenders and maybe a bow tie-- that could work.. Pretty standard issue hipster attire.. Have a nice party.
I'm not sure how they would work with a skirt :P. You're definitely going to want to shave the sides of your head. It's the only way.. It'll be like a mohawk.. Just kidding, but that's a thing I see.. Along with dyed hair.. But for you.... You're going to want to get your hair as poofy as possible.
Molly has short hair.
She wasn't a hipster when she had long hair.. Here you go:. Just put all of your hair to one side of your head.. And don't forget an old fashioned hat.. Like the messenger/paperboy hat you have.
That works too.. You're going to have to take your contacts out and wear your glasses.. Glasses are pretty much standard (for some reason). I hear ironic t-shirts are good.. That or attire from the 50's-80's.. Oh!. No offense, but you could bring your guitar too.. (Guitar is cool, but you could play something like Wonderwall or Mumford and Sons over and over). Goodnight and sweet dreams. Sorry if some of my suggestions were bad or sounded like they were coming from the wrong place. I hope you enjoy the rest of your night, and the rest of the party.
Wow!. Not going to lie, you look super adorable.. I think it would be pretty great to see that outfit in person.
You said that before.. They look good on you.
You look amazing.. I would but that as my phone background if I could.. put*
Oh, it's not too noticeable.. Thanks for showing me.. You need to calm down on the cuteness factor though.. Just kidding.. Your cuteness factor is right where it should be.. Excuse my sillyness factor though.. Thanks again for the picture! Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Sorry if I offended you.
If you say so.. Have a great rest of your night if you're still partying.
Lackluster.. But that's okay. I'm working on it.. I saw bits of your day, so I can deduce that it was great.. Sleep tight.
It is great. I've been looking over my assignments.. I guess I wish I had done more work though.. But it's okay. I'll get more done tomorrow.
I have a book and a magazine to design.. So I was reviewing how to put them together.
That does sound interesting.. I still have those games I want to make :P
That sounds great.. I think I know the art style I want for "Curse of the Werekitten". I want a sketchy animation type art style-- the sketch would overlay the 3D character that is rendered with cell shading. I'm not sure how that would work though.. I just thought it would be neat-- I'll look into it.. Goodnight.
I think that would be cool.
I was thinking either a sketchy animation look or a clay look.
I like the balloon so much more than the thumbs up!. Thank you so much!!!. You're the best.
You're great.. I love you!
(hug)
Goodnight.. Good afternoon.
I hope you have a great day.
Is the kissy face new?
I see it.. Times they are a changin'.. I hope your day is going well.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Sleep tight.. I'm not sure if I would be able to afford going to HackTech.
Okay.. Are you still going?
Oh.. okay.. Are you okay?
Oh goodness.. This movie marathon is quite the marathon.. I saw you were hanging out with Cedric. How is he?
Just waiting for someone to pop in.. Don't let him trick you into immortality.. Enjoy yourself.. I managed to make two drawings. I'll try to get more done in the morning.. Goodnight.
I love you.
(hug). I still haven't decided on a book to design yet.. I know it wasn't on the list, but I kind of want to do The Wizard of Oz.. (It's one of my dad's favorite movies, so I think he might like it if it were a gift). I'll think about it though.. sorry for bringing it up so often.
I think he. 's more familiar with the movie*. But I think he is a fan of the imagery.. Specifically the Tin Man :P. And he did like the silhouettes, but I think I'll make a more illustrated version.. Anyway.. I hope you have a great day! I love you, Leandra.
Normally watercolor, but the teacher wanted to give us time to gather supplies. Instead I'm having a senior project meeting at 2:30 and then Publication Design at 3:50.
Drawings for the books? Or just drawings in general?
Okay! As soon as I make some!. I thought I'd send you a picture message yesterday, but I didn't want to bother you.
I'm not sure. I just noticed how busy you are. You might not have time for some things.. And even if you are, you might not welcome things either.
I will keep that in mind.. I'm trying to decode the picture, but I'm starting to think it's just a banana, hair dryer, and glasses.
Banana for scale?. That's... funny..
Me too.. I'll be right there with you.. Sans the actual coding.
Thank you!
I got it. Thanks.
It looks pretty interesting so far.
Thanks again!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Wow!. Must feel magical!
I red up to the Half Blood Prince, I believe.. But I've seen all six movies.
What? There's more than six books/movies??. o.o
I'm kidding-- the final book came after I was interested.
I suppose.. It just came two years too late :P
Sweet dreams to you too.. I hope you had a magical day.. I love you.
(hug)
I haven't deceived anyone into taking it, if that's what you mean.
I guess so.. How are you?. I hope you had a great day.
I've just been worrying about homework.. Nothing to highlight.. I did go to the grocery store though.
Yeah. I've got quite a bit ahead of me.
I haven't even crossed the starting line.. So I suppose that's one more thing to worry about.. I guess I do have a highlight though, I picked up my shoes from the shoe repair store.. They look pretty nice.. Oh! And guess what came in the mail?
I thought you'd guess :P
I guess you don't have to keep guessing. You'll find out eventually.. Anyway. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I'm working on The Wonderful Wizard of Oz for the book project.
Yeah. I need to do that too.
Oh.. it's not that.. We haven't spent much time together, because we have different class times.. It's just been me, myself, and I.. Goodnight.
It's a secret unless you guess it.. Or until you visit.
That might give it away.. It's something you can wear.
No.
Indeed... I'm having a tough time making illustrations for Wizard of Oz.. I hope it comes easier soon.
I guess it's difficult to stray away from the original illustrations.. Those are what come to mind.. Well goodnight.. I guess you already went to sleep.. Are you still coming this weekend?
You don't have to worry about it.
When are you planning?. to*
I guess I have no choice then.
I can do it with you. I wouldn't want you to go up all alone.. (With the instructor)
I should get ready too.
I can skydive with you.
Tah tah for now.
Rawr to you!. Wow.. You know me and free t-shirts.
I always appreciate a good free tee.. I'm going to head to watercolor now.. I love you. I hope your day is going swimmingly.. Especially if the snow is melting, then you'll have to be swimming to class.
It was okay, she didn't like what I painted, but it was okay.
I painted the Wizard of Oz characters.. Hello.
I thought since we were talking about watercolor that it would be clear that it's my teacher.. I'll try to be clearer next time.
I'm sorry.
That's different, because there's no context.
I said "painted" in the same sentence, solidifying its context.
That may be the case, but I wouldn't care or mention whether someone else didn't like it.
I'll work on it.
I suppose.. I am boiling chicken.
(It's not fresh)
(But I have fresh salmon). I generally eat bad stuff for me.
Like apples, bananas, chicken, granola, eggs, bread, salmon, and mixed spring mix.. I mean frozen chicken, and fresh salmon.
The unmentioned cheerios.
It's whole wheat (or so it says)
I have a bunch of quick oats.
I want to fix some rice sometime.
It always is.
Scurvy is very difficult to get.. Oh and I drink 2% milk pretty regularly.
What do you mean?. It's not made yet.
I wish they were different. I'm trying my best to what I can afford.. By "they" I mean, my meals... Okay.. well.. goodnight. I hope you had a nice day.
That doesn't sound like enough.. like it's*. I also think I need to eat more :P
Okay.. Thanks.. That'd be great!. I guess it's gotten late. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I would.. I've got a quiz to study for, and a poster to dsign.. And I have this to fill out:
It's for my Portfolio class.
I'm not sure if I can make some of the judgements on there.
You haven't really been prodding me.
Oh.. I thought you meant recently.. I would apply, but I don't have a portfolio together.
(The website doesn't count)
I need a more professional website.
I suppose.. There aren't many places that are "screaming my name"
My heart hasn't picked.
That's pretty fortunate.
Okay. I can try.
I will get to work after classes tomorrow.. Either then, or Friday.. It's okay if you don't visit.. I know that finding a ride is difficult and it's just one more thing to do-- so don't worry.
You can always visit another time. I don't mind.
Good luck on the homework.
No, I'll be doing some reading and poster design.
Why is it sad?
Not at all.
Because it's not "whatever". It's just-- I know you're doing your own thing, and most times that doesn't involve me, but I shouldn't mind it.
It shouldn't bother me.. I can't expect you to be around.
I don't mean to say that.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Sleep tight.. Don't let the bed bugs bite.
Good morning.
I would be worried if it were anyone else/. You know.. using my accounts :P. Unless it is someone else!. o.o
Because I'm being silly?
I can be your ride.. I don't have class Friday.
Okay. I can be a last resort then.. Kristi Marie had a listing 13 hours ago, but she's full now.. Maybe you can check with her just in case a spot opens up.
Oh, of course.
What time would you like for me to show up?
Okay. So I would need to leave around 8:50?. There's a ride from Richmond-- but that may be out of the way.
I can definitely give you a ride.. I don't mind.. (Sorry for saying that again). (but it's really no issue)
You can choose anything you like.. Should I make two listings? One to go to Charlottesville and the other to Virginia Tech?. And if you're driving-- should you post the second so that we avoid confusion?. I'm not certain how much to charge on the ride board.
Complications arose. I will likely only be able to leave by 9:30 (the earliest). I don't want to say, because it may upset the affected party.. Is this okay?
I didn't want to say what the complications were, in case you were wondering.. Okay-- I'll say "Some time before 12pm.. "*
Okay...?
You didn't see Sedrek Kovar?. If you did, then I can still come and pick you up.
It's on the Virginia Tech Carpool
He did say 3-4, but I understand.. Like I said, I can be your ride.. No need to worry.. Just have to solve some issues in the morning.. I'm hesitant to make a listing until I know the time I'm leaving.
No. Just something time consuming.. "Making a one way trip to Charlottesville tomorrow (Friday, January 29th) some time before 12pm."
Okay.
I can give you a ride then too.. If no other options come up.
Goodnight. I'm going to sweep you away.
Should I bring your gift then or do you want it later?. Should I make my post on those?
It's not a round trip though.
But that's not certain yet.. I don't want to make promises I can't keep.
Sorry... Goodnight.. Good morning.
It's taking a while, but it's getting there.. I might be able to leave at the time I posted-- no takers yet though.. Want to make a listing for Charlottesville?
I'm likely not quite ready to leave.
Around that time.
I was going to do that.
Anything you want me to bring?
Oh! Thanks. I had issues with my printer here. I was going to find another printer, but that helps.. And I'll wear my swimsuit under my clothes.. I was going to wear something nice to see you in, should I change and wear something casual?
Can do.
Okay. I can bring the swimming trunks and a t-shirt.
I'll see you around too.. Great profile picture!
You've traded me in for a bird.
Goodnight.. Be sure to sleep.. Sorry to say that though (about trading me) Part of me thought you were growing away from me, because you no longer wanted me in your picture.. I hope you made it safely to Charlottesville!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
That's because you look great in the photo!. But part of me misses being with you.. I'm glad you're safe!. Don't forget to stretch!. You might be sore from scuba!. (you might not feel it now, but you will!)
Oh no! You left before you got kisses on the random bruises.
You also had random cuts, so that just shows a portion to how dangerous it is.. They just won't!. You'll have to come back asap!
Oh, I know!. Magazines are expensive!. And there was only one animation related and one anime, Japanese film related.. That's just an update on what I had been doing-- since I said I was going to Barnes & Noble.. Anyway-- I'm sure you're super sleepy, so goodnight and sweet dreams to you.
Yeah-- we're also going to have to have the magazine work for print as well as an app.. But that's okay, because I think there's a program that makes it fairly easy to convert.. I love you! Goodnight.
Oh-- that's just "Undertale". And it's inspired from other games like Earthbound.
Oh yes I know!. Good morning!. I hope you have an awesome day today.
Watercolor and publication design. Which translates to "I think I want to paint a duck" and "reading magazines, and preparing pages for the Wizard of Oz". "Accompanied with illustrations". What are you doing today?
Tah tah for now, cutie!. Don't forget-- you can forgo a hairdryer, because you look awesome either way!. Tah tah for now.
You're the heart, by the way.
You're perfect!. For heart hugs!. Whoa! Delta Rae is coming back?
Cool!
I see!
Cool cool!. How's it going?
I'm working on homework.. Book layout n' whatnot.. I messed up on my ducks!. But it's okay.
Oh-- no! The black paper that I laid over it transferred ink to the painting.
Yep!. Surprise!
I can show you in person!
Any time!. I'll have class Wednesday to work/finish it up!
I can only hope.. (hug). How has your day been>. ?*. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Would your mother like a painting of a duck? I know it's something in her house... could be a nice present. Though I know that she doesn't necessarily need more stuff, but ducks are nice!
Good morning.
I had a dream about you.. How did you sleep?
I slept well too. Did you go to bed late?
Wow! I didn't even know.. I last heard from you at 8, so I thought you went to bed early :P
That's good.. I hope you have a great day today.. Have a good time in Data Science.
Thanks!. Hello.. I'm back from shopping.. Not that you knew I was ever actually shopping.. Did you go shopping today?
Today's a good day to.. If you ever decide to.
Mostly just the Senior Discount today :P
Yep.. I found the popcorn you liked on sale. I did not find the cheese flavored kind though.. How was/is small group?
Oh. I didn't realize it was evil.. Good luck on homework.. I'll be here if you want to talk to me, or if you want compliments. Otherwise I'll keep out of your hair.
Book covers and page layouts.
That's on sale as well as the caramel corn.. Unfortunately I went with caramel corn :P
I usually don't, but I saw it was the kind you were crazy about.. But I suppose I should have gone with kettle corn if I were to go with any corn at all.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you!
(hug)
Good morning.. I tried flour shampoo today.. (You know-- just flour :P). You were my inspiration.
My hair doesn't really feel clean, and I think I smell like a biscuit.
Then that's okay.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Hello!
Participated in watercolor Elaborated on a font design Tried to design book covers Eating food Really excited to talk to you
Yes.. The font was for that too :P. I also worked on the character illustrations.. Have you checked your phone recently?
I sent you a picture.
I definitely sent it. But I can resend it too.
Do you like it?. It's not very illustrative, but I did a good amount of work on the lettering.
So you're saying it's bad?!?!?
Well that's okay.. I was thinking it would look nice in gold.. I'm not certain where to go with the cover art just yet.. Have you received the image yet?
Thanks!. Would you be interested in a painting such as that one?. Probably not?. Anyway-- it's late, so I'll say goodnight for now.
Not "around around"
Is that so?
Wow!. That's interesting.. Sounds like fun!. Getting to roll around n' such.
I bet!. Just be careful not to roll into anyone.. Unless you roll into me. I won't mind.. In fact, your rolling will be welcomed, and you will be embraced.. I'm going to sleep now. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
I think so. I thought I had some dreams about texting someone, but that actually happened. :P. Anyway. I suppose I should roll over to my class.. Have a nice day today.
It was purposeful texting, but it happened during the night, so I thought it didn't happen :P. Tah tah for now.
I suppose so.. Today is number two in flour hair.
That would be great.
Scrub-a-dub-dub!
I don't have any-- but I can get some.
Thank you!. Boop!. Have fun in Data Science.
Have fun in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Break a leg dancing!. (don't really though-- just for good luck)
Me too.. Do you want to meet there?
Would you like for me to pick you up then?
Okay.. Sorry I missed your call
Well free to the next time you want to call, I had just left my phone in my jacket pocket.. feel free*. I'll be around my phone from now on.. Goodnight.. Sweet dreams.. Good morning.
Looks like I bombarded you with messages.. I hope game design was fun.
Have a safe trip.. I'll be ready to head over to the dive center whenever you arrive.. Did you want me to pick you up?. Are you exercising in the morning? Would you like company?. I guess I'd be cramping your style though.
We could go there if you'd like.. Well... goodnight.
We can go to the gym, because there's room.. Or you can just do your usual routine.
Sure. We can do that.. Goodnight.
Sweet dreams to you too.. Good morning.
Are you ready for your day?
Awesome.. Okay, well have a great one.
I'm making banana pancakes, if you would care for any.
Okay.. I guess I don't have much else to offer.. I hope you get to do everything you want to today.. Good luck.. We didn't do much planning last night. Did you still want help?
With planning?. For the trip?
Any time you want to take care of that, I can do so.. I mean we, of course, but I was trying to say I would be ready whenever you wanted to.
I hope your day is going well.. I wanted to see you today, but it'll probably be late by the time you respond to this. I hope you had a good day, I did the exercise by myself and I made sure to have a healthy breakfast and lunch. I hope you got everything you needed done today. I'm still working on homework.. That's just my update.
I didn't say that.
:P. I just wanted to see you.. I feel like that isn't a reciprocated feeling though.. That's okay though. I can leave you alone.
Just from the neglect.
The state of being uncared for. Not being around.. Kind of how you leave periodically mid conversation for prolonged periods of time.. I also thought we had plans for the day.. I'll just be alone then.. Have a good night.
We were going to the rec center to exercise and play ping pong.. I guess you needed that in writing with an exact time.. I don't think I've been treated like a boyfriend lately, so I'm sorry if I haven't been acting like much of one. Don't worry about me though, enjoy your weekend.. Have a safe trip back to Charlottesville.
I thought you would have remembered.
I didn't hear from you either.. It doesn't matter.. I'll be fine on my own from now on.
I feel alone.. But it doesn't matter.
That's how I feel like I've been treated.. I don't think you want anything to do with me.. I'm unwanted.. And you're not really around.. I'm just talking to myself.. I can do that without you.
I am expecting a response.. But I guess I don't know how conversations work then.
You're supposed to say: "I'm ready to now!". or something.. or "I really want to see you right away, get over here" not "Thank you"
I know.
You'd want me to specify a place and a time-- but I don't know when you'd be ready, so I can't make a time.. I also don't have anywhere to take you-- and I can't invite myself over to your house.
Okay.
I don't have my watercolors with me. I just brought the painting to show you in person.
It wasn't any trouble.. Even if you don't see it.. Goodnight.
No.
Yes.
No. Just bye.
The permanent kind.
It's like saying goodbye to a friend you won't see again.. I don't feel wanted, so it's best that I go.. It's something you probably should have already done.
I shouldn't talk, because I don't make meaningful conversation and I only hint at things.
I'm done.
I won't, because I feel unwanted and unloved. My hearts still broken from the several times you've broken it, and you don't care. I'm tired. I'm not what you want, and I've done things that you don't like and every time you remind me that you don't like it.. No. I'm alone.
I'm sure that I'm alone.
I can't.. You don't have to send anyone here, and you don't have to come either.
You're allowed to do anything.. And I wanted to see you all day.. But you're doing your own thing, and it's gotten late.. I'm still beaten over this, because you still keep ties with him. You want him in your life more than you want me. It doesn't help that you don't want me to compliment you, to touch you, or anything. I feel like a second choice, and I'm tired of it.. You don't want me to kiss you anymore. Which makes me feel like a friend more than anything else.. I'm just someone you occasionally talk to.
Okay.
I would stick longer.
So that's that?
No. But when you leave me alone you remind me of how I felt before.. I just wanted for you to say "Hey, I want to see you today"
Why didn't you say so?. I've been waiting all day.
I have, but you've either been busy, or you rejected them.. There isn't much of a place for you to work if I invited you to my house, I can't invite myself to your house, and I don't know where else you'd want to be.. I think I have an ice cream maker in the freezer. I could go buy some avocados and we could make ice cream.
I can. I planned an entire day, but you didn't like my plans.. So we made dinner instead.. Just mentioning the ice cream maker probably made you shiver and think "No no no no no"
If my plans don't include hiking, bike riding, kite flying, horseback riding, or exercise, you generally don't want to do it.. And then those plans are really just recycled plans.
I wanted to play Earthbound with you, but since it's single player, you didn't want to share the experience.. I think the only thing I can share with you is homework.. Things like going out to bowl, playing video games, or watching a movie don't seem to interest you.. I wanted to play 80's Trivia with you, but I think you wanted to play Banagrams instead.. It's not that I don't make suggestions, but you're very particular, even if you say "if it's something I wanted to do I would be happy.". I suggested we exercise together this morning.
Except for playing Earthbound, which you said no to before I brought it.
That list were the things I wanted to do, but I wanted to make sure you'd enjoy yourself.. I was very excited to play Earthbound.
Because you said you didn't want to.
I'm not going to bring my super nintendo, controllers, cables, and the game if you don't want to play.. I've done that before, and it just sat in my backpack.
I can't do whatever I want. I need your consent first.
Okay.. Would you like to work on homework tomorrow? We can work at the library.. Wait.. hold on.. It opens at 1pm tomorrow and closes at 5pm.. Or we can just find a room in Squires.
If we go to Squires, we could go around 9am?. I figure that gives you an hour to sleep in, an hour to exercise, and an hour to shower and get ready.. But I suppose you may take longer though.
I can pick you up.
I suppose that depends. Would you like to pack lunch or leave for lunch?. Also-- would you want to take billiard breaks?. billiards*. I was thinking we would stay until we felt we accomplished a good amount of work-- or felt comfortable in the amount of work we did.. Then I can take you home.. I would offer to help you pack, but I'm assuming that you're still pretty collected.
I know. But you need to get ready Sunday so you can leave Monday.
Yes, but you should be packed and ready.. If there were any clothes you wanted to try, I could give you my opinion.
That's what I said.. But I can help you make a few decisions?. Just an option.. I can help you make dinner too.
Did you want to check off Independence Day from your to watch movie list?. I would be interested. I was also looking at a movie called "Nocturna" that I wanted to see.
No. That's fine. I thought you'd say that, but I figured I'd ask.. If it isn't so cold, we should go up to the park and take a break from homework.. Can you send me the links to Cumberland Island and everything?. I need to look over everything so that we can plan tomorrow as well.. I'll need to go to Tech Dive Center tomorrow, I think I'll pay the $25 rental fee then.
Okay.. That can work.. I'll see you tomorrow at 9.
Goodnight.. Sleep well.. Sweet dreams too.
That's exciting.. I wish I could be going to Michigan :P. I hope you have fun.
Wow!. I should apply for one.
That's a lot.. I was going to sit in and observe the process.
I suppose.. I think I'm going to sleep now.
Goodnight.. I'll see you in the morning.
Sleep tight.. Be sure to stay cuddly.. The bak kwa looks good.
Then its looks aren't deceiving then.. It looks like meat brownies.. That sounded more delicious in my head.
I suppose so.. Good job on the bak kwa.
I'm not sure what it's supposed to look/taste like, but it looks good to me.. Uh oh. Filler copy?
You can't agree to those terms.. They're outlandish.. I guess I don't find that funny either.. Good morning.. How are you doing on time?. I just got out of the shower, so I can be there soon, but I may go over a bit. Perhaps 5-15 minutes.. I'll still try to be there by 9, of course.
Hello!
Hello there, Partner!. How's the old homestead?
Awesome!. I'll let you keep tending to the farm.. I'll be here whenever you want to chat by the watering hole.
Just reformatting!. There were quite a bit of tips my professor had to show us (the class).. For publications.
Yup! It'll make the book design go much faster.
Indeed!. What are you up to?
:P. A write up about your write up about your code?
Whoa.. writeception.. Sounds interesting.
Really?. I thought it was great!. :3. I just picked Katy up from school!. In case you were wondering where I was.\
Yeah! I was like "Wow. This girl knows her stuff!". And by stuff I mean "puns"
Probably!. I was like "Wow! I want to get her a big hug.". But now I'm like "Wow! I want to give her a big hug, but not because she made a pun."
Is it though?
Sweet dreams to you!. I'll be saving them for when you're around!. Goodnight. I love you!
Sleep tight!
Good morning!
I can be the help!. But... I can't send myself just yet!. Just be sure to practice this weekend, and I can definitely help then!
That's okay!
Involuntary whimpering causes me to involuntary hug you.. (It's not really involuntary, of course)
I hope you do too!. I love you. Good luck with everything today.
You've got this!. And you've got this (points to self) too!
No problem!
!!!. Just think.. you could have had many suspenders days last week!. Oh.. the suspenders are red-- that means they're good for Valentines Day parties.
I'm assuming there are many at UVa.. There are plans for one coming this weekend, but I think I'd rather spend the time with you.
I'm supposed to wait to talk to you tomorrow.. That's not the order the words need to be in.... until* tomorrow.
I was teasing you.. You were teasing me first-- but I suppose it was more hurtful teasing.. Unless you weren't teasing me, and you were just trying to be mean.. I wasn't going to tell you what I wanted to do, because I thought you liked surprises.. Now I feel ignored.
That's good.. I'm not sure what you were doing to reset your pin. I know my password, but do I intentionally say "Forgot password"?
Okay. I was just using the link you sent me.. I reset the pin.. Thanks.. I'll check it out tomorrow, and if it doesn't work I will call customer service.
Are you telling me because you want me to go? Or because you're signing up?
Okay.. All signed up.
I won't say I'm going until I am accepted.
What are you working on?
What kind of chocolate?
I'm designing the book interior. I'm a bit hesitant to dive into the watercolor for the cover.. I didn't realize you had taken some!. Or.. maybe I did... That's cool.
Oh!. That's awesome!. You might need more when you visit!. It's the Chocolate Holiday after all.
With great power comes great chocolate abilities.
I might.. I'll have to find the masking tape.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I should-- but if I don't, and you go to sleep before I do, then I've still wished you sweet dreams.
Of course.. Gotta have those sweet caramel dreams!
I saw recipes for homemade twix, kit kat, and almond joys.. I'm letting you know, because those are some of my preferred candies :P
I was going to look at how to make them healthier by making a few substitutions.. But it's not necessary :P
Okay: The go to response for when you don't care to respond.. "But Peter, I need three hands to count the amount you've said that today."
Definitely a stuffy penguin :P
Oh no... that shouldn't even be used as a joke.
I'm finding it difficult to design a joint other than a ball/socket.. One that retains the rotation, but can be easily fabricated.. I suppose I have something I can try.. It probably won't be very efficient, and won't make for an easily repairable armature, but I'll see how it holds together.
I think if it were a series of washers with a screw holding it together, it could function while retaining the ability to be fixed (I can replace the screw assembly easier than to build something again). The assembly will work for the neck, I don't need it for the legs, but I need something for the arms.. I might just have to have a series of hinges.. However, that has potential to fail.
I wanted to show you.. But if you have any ideas, that would be great.. But not necessary.
That's okay.
Making stiff hinges is what is problematic.. And I can't use thick wire for the particular puppet.. I need to it be functional-- which is a purpose of the project.. I'll keep at the drawing board.. Thanks anyway
Goodnight.. Sleep well!. The sweet dreams from before might have run out, so... Sweet dreams!. Good morning!
I hope you slept well.. Have fun in Game Design!
Any time!. I think it's really cool that you have a sprite (decompiler?) application!
Sounds cool to me!. It appears that I have misplaced one of my nice pencils.. I hope I left it in Blacksburg!. Anyway... off I go to Watercolor.. I think you'll like what I plan to paint next!
Awesome, thank you!
Sure. I can even help you film it.. I probably won't forget, but be sure to remind me just to be safe@!. I'll be sure to charge it when I get home.
What are you filming?. Do you need a tripod?
Okay. I have access to one (It's not sturdy, but it should do the job). I'll have everything ready for you.. I can help with setting everything up.
It won't be a problem.. I suppose you won't want me around during filming, so I will brief you on how to do everything-- but I will do most of the technical stuff.. Will you want a large depth of field in which nothing is blurry, or a shallow one in which you'll be in focus, but the background will be blurry?. Oh-- have fun in Defense OH
Oh.. did you drop that class? Or are you skipping?. It's still in your calendar.
I see.. I didn't know that.. But now I know.. Because it's our super short show.. Off to publications class. Have fun at Text Mining.
Thanks.. Enjoy breakdancing.
Any time.. Were there any activities you were looking forward to?. I'm just asking for input.. Unless you don't want to spend time with me, that's fine too.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLMeDUBKmBs
I just was thinking that I can't make the decision-- so if you didn't want to, I should respect that.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Sleep tight.
Uh oh.. there's a wasp flying in my room.. Maybe you had no intention to see me?
Well I didn't want to create any obligation if you wanted other things.. I've been hurt before, and I know keeping plans can be hard.
I guess I meant that I've been hurt, and feeling like you would want to see me is hard to believe.. I have a few plans..
Self-fulfilling prophecy?. I'm sorry. I expect the worst.. My plans were a surprise, unless you want to know them.
Honestly, you probably don't, since you want me to be different.
I think you're partly at fault for my low self esteem.
You mentioned to me that you like guys with muscles. You constantly mention that I cannot do anything for myself. You went off galavanting with a previous romantic partner, even after you assured me you were "just friends." You even compared me to him mentioning how confident he was.
It hard to be confident in you. You can do it all over again.
It just hurt me that you like muscles on guys-- when I'm not the person that you can use as reference.
Not the way you have been. You either guilt trip me, threaten (pressure) me.. It's just that it culminates to me not being the person you want.. That you've checked out other guys and said "Wow-- he has great shoulders" or "His confidence is super attractive I'm going to drool over him"
I thought that until you went and decided that I wasn't who you wanted.. If I was who you wanted, you would have not tried to "resolve" things with your past, because you would have been happy in your present.
There were better ways to help you move forward, because it only pushed me back.
I can't.. Because I wasn't a part of it.
Peace may be easier if I didn't stay with the person that caused the distress.. Why should I be with a person who cares for me so little that they would hurt me like that?
The answer is to not be with that person.
"Or nah?" bothers me more than you know.. And you're the only person that I've been in a relationship with.
I don't like it because it's annoying.
Probably not.. "Or nah?" also made things sound like a joke.. Like you're not taking anything seriously.
That means you're the only person to have hurt me.. So it's obvious that the person is you.
I've already said everything.
I suppose.. I didn't mean to offend you before.. It just wasn't clear that you were coming this weekend to see me-- especially since it sounded like you had work to be doing.. I thought you were just going to spend time with your mother and do you work.. I mean-- I'd be around for a little while setting up the camera and everything, but I thought that was going to be it.
I apologize.. I always assume you're busy.. You've found so many extracurricular activities, that it's hard to think you have any extra time.
I understand. It just starts to feel like your plans don't include me.. Like: "Whoever I am monogamous with at the time.". Means that I'm not part of your future.
I'm quoting you.
You said you planned on going on a trip back to Europe to do something that can be construed as romantic, so I asked who would you go with? And that was your response.
Maybe because it wasn't very important to you-- but it stuck with me.
Mostly because it tells me you don't expect to be in a relationship with me in the future.
If you expected to be with me in the future then you would say "You, silly."
It's not inferring-- by not being specific, you open it up to anyone, and anyone isn't me.
Because I was your sillyhead at one point...
It doesn't exclude me, but the likelihood that it is me is very low.
Which you could have said it would be me-- but you opened it up to anyone.
No. I shouldn't have kept you up this late in the first place.
Of course.
Perhaps.. I think I don't like "or nah" because it makes you sound like a generic, cookie-cutter person I meet and see over social media.
But I don't know otherwise-- as that could be who you become.
You'll just be like every other girl. One who likes muscular men, starbucks, and twitter.. I'm pretty out of touch with things, so that's not the best list of examples.
Especially not the first one.
I'm sure.. It won't be me though.
So whoever you're basing that attraction on must be good looking.
Of course-- I just mean that it's not me.. Which makes me disappointed.
Just the comments you've made have made me reach the conclusion that I'm not who you want.. And I know you're saying that's not true.. But it's just how you've made me feel.
Yes. You're with me, but I'm not you're ideal choice.
Which is why you try to push, change, and shape me whenever you can.
But your ideal is what you should strive for.
Just that I'm sorry, I went overboard, and that I love you.
Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I'll be writing some essays.. Good morning.
Have a great day!. I'm excited for you.
Oh... you know!. (you probably don't know, but... you know!). O. I'll stop being cryptic.
(hug). (hug)(hug). (hug)(hug). Oops.. I missed a step.. That's a tripping hazard.. Have fun defending against Voldemort today.. http://birding.about.com/od/birdfeeders/a/whatduckseat.htm
Wow.. is this digital painting?
I'm looking forward to see you too!
I'm not sure which one I preferred.. It's not all that different in price from a new one.. Oh-- at first I couldn't tell if it was a different model or not :P. Is that someone you met in Paris?. Interesting thing in your hand.
The Deviant Art. The one one Amazon is $75.. That one is $73.95.. on* Amazon.

I thought you were saying "bite". Because it's bait.. And I suppose so!. Because it's new, and that's better than used :P
I hope not either!. I'll buy too.. I'll see you tomorrow.. Goodnight for now!. Sweet dreams.. Good luck with your work.
Designing the armatures to my stop motion puppets.
I'm going to carve the head, maybe the feet, and maybe the hands out of wax and cast them in brass.. The other parts should be easily manufactured using a piece of copper rod.. Oh-- and copper sheets of course.. Lion and Scarecrow will both have simple wire armatures.. So I'm focusing mostly on the Tinman.. But I might go to bed early and work on it in the morning.
You sound fantastic!. What are you up to?. I suppose you're too deep in thought to answer... Okay.. well.. goodnight and sweet dreams.
Sounds time consuming :P. Enjoy yourself.
I guess everything consumes time.. But I suppose I relate it more to things that may not be necessary, but still consume time.. When you say clips it sounds like you're just watching people dancing, but you're not really "learning". In short bursts*
It's usually too fast to learn by watching.
Oh. That makes sense.. It's like watching break down videos that break down the move, but without the talking.. And you do it at your own pace.. I'm glad your having fun.. you're*. I kind of wish you wanted to chat a little more, but I haven't been much of a conversationalist lately, so I understand if you don't want to.. See you around. Goodnight.
I liked them when I wore them at the pool.. I suppose the listing is over though.. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Aeris-Accel-Scuba-Fins-BLACK-Size-REGULAR-NEW-Snorkeling-SCUBA-OCEANIC-/182020844705?hash=item2a6149aca1:g:GiAAAOSw3ydVmAes. This is still there though :P
Oh.. you know me.. I'm not sure what the difference is between regular and small though.. Are you going to need me to pick you up anywhere/. ?*. I'm free to do so, and I would be glad to.. Oh! I forgot to tell you, But on Wednesday I got to pet puppies!. I'm safe!. It was just a bit of a dusting of snow (which looks pretty). (:
(hug). I overslept a bit I think.. I'm not sure how quickly I can meet you at 11!. But I will try my berry best!
Good morning!. Is it still okay to come over?
Did you just wake up?
Okay! I can wait a bit!. I won't take away from family time!!
I was thinking we would do homework, take a break and get burrito bowls at Chipotle, I heard you were interesting in cuddling-- so that would be nice!. We could come back to my house after Chipotle and play Pac Man Vs for a short amount of time.. Oh-- and you need that video, so you should prepare what you're going to say.. I will bring the camera and tripod.. We could film it in Squires (it'll look all professional.)
You would prefer your room?
Okay!. When you are finished with breakfast, I can be like Red Rover!
(: !
I'm waiting until I know that you've finished your breakfast :P. What are you up to?
(I'm also having a discussion about my logo-- in case you thought I was just sitting here)
No, with a fellow classmate.
Just over facebook.. Wow!. She's so good!
Her hands are effortlessly gliding on the keyboard!. Thank you for showing this to me!
(hug). Can I come hug you now?. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjm18-idNkg. I really do wish to see you, and I didn't mean for things to not go according to plans, but I'm ready whenever you see this message!!. And I can be over right away!!!
It's getting pretty close to the time we said we would go to Chipotle-- but I think we can work on homework until 3 and then go and eat there.. Or we can go to my house and eat there, if you would prefer that, and I thought maybe 2-3 rounds of Pacman vs, depending on how long the rounds go for.. Then we film your video!
If that works for you!. I'll be right over! (:. (hug) (hug)(hug)
(!!!! :3)
Me too!. School is closed tomorrow! :P. It's a miracle!. Or.. dreams do come true!
(Is that what you said?). No, it's anticipation from the upcoming snow.
I'm not sure.. There once was a time that the school didn't close for nobody no how.. Now the school is closure crazy.
Not really.. But I suppose I have a homework day tomorrow.
Mhmm!
Or donuts!
Nom!. The snow got crazy so fast!. But I am safe, and if you care about that sort of thing, then it's good!
Ahh!. :P. that safe doesn't look safe!. I love you!
(hug). I had a great Valentines Day with you!
Any time!. Feel free to do anything next time I see you
Just feel free!. Anything you like!
Self-defense practice.
You bet!. We could lay down some mats.. hug it out.. I mean-- duel it out.
But injuring your attacker is part of the deal, so I understand if you do!
I would prefer the same, but things happen :P. Like me falling asleep in my clothes, because it was cold and I bundled up in my blankets.
But if you're here, then I'd be busy tucking you in!
(hug). Do you still have classes today?
Awesome!. We read that in English class!. Snow Day!!!!. Time to watch Harry Potter again!!
It was good.. Make a wish!
That's just 2 hours a day.. Doesn't sound too bad.. It's not like you need it for your resume, though! So you should only do it if you find it fun!
Definitely!
Especially if it becomes a substantial entity.. Definitely that too!
Having the understanding you have is a plus, because you'll understand what everyone is saying.
I think it's a good start for thinking about business.
I know you can do a lot that you would rather do, but it's actual experience.
If you had a different internship lined up, then you could debate between the two.
That's true.
This could complicate things, but maybe you could take one less class?. You know.. to balance the work load?
Of course, I was just thinking you could take it later on.
I was thinking that too.
Definitely discuss what will be needed of you first.. It might be something that interests you.. You might just have to spend less time at clubs.. I know that sounds lame :P
That's fine.. Are your classes cancelled on Friday?
I think you should mention that you would feel comfortable in discussion, because of your mechanical engineering background, but that coding is where your heart is.. Are you sure you would want to be in a car for a longer period of time?. I can drive, and you can nap!. But then it'll get super late.
I will likely be in Blacksburg before you. I can pack the car before you arrive.
The schedule seems fine. The only reason to leave earlier is to take longer nap sessions :P
Yep.. Well I'm just kidding :P
If we leave sooner, we can nap longer :P
The sooner we leave the longer we are on the road?
Unless we drive slower :P
We're not allowed to, I thought.
And it seems to be cheaper.
And it's only $20.
I meant each.
I have plenty :P
Or-- access to plenty.
I will do the same!
That is cool!
That sounds good!
So we won't leave Thursday?
Oh, right!. That sounds nice.
Whoa.... Disneyworld/. ??
Manatee Snorkeling sounds exciting!. Sounds great!
Yeah!
Universal Studios has Harry Potter.. Which sounds pretty magical!
So cool!. I'm fine without, of course!@
Just mention how you think it would be fun, that you're most interested in coding, but that you feel comfortable at least discussing mechanical engineering, but that your school schedule is hectic.. You should just try to confirm what your duties would be.
You can say "Though the offer sounds appetizing, I do not believe my current schedule would allow time to devout to such an internship."
Okay.. too formal you say.. I can work on that.. You could say "Kay thanks bye"
(That's actually the exact thing you shouldn't say)
My class gets out at 3:15. I could walk home in 15 minutes and then drive to Blacksburg in 30 or so.. So 4ish.
It's possible!. We might be so tired that we just want to sleep once we're there.
But will I be okay?
Or I can drive until I get tired.
What about if I wake up from my sleep, then I take over?
Then you get rest too.
Sounds good.
(hug). I hope you are having a nice Presidents' Day!
Thanks!. I love you!
(hug). The lion has been redesigned and I'm working on fabrication!. Same with the scarecrow.
I suppose I need to decide on the fabric for the scarecrows clothing.. I don't have any epoxy (I think mine went bad) so I'll have to wait until tomorrow to get some.. I'll probably get some plumbers epoxy too, because it's easier to use than to drill holes on dowel rods.. Just an update.. I know it isn't much, but I'm hoping to do more!
It's not much!. I feel like I need to make the puppets larger, but the lion is constrained to the size of the wooden egg I have.
Those things are expensive. :P. I could just bulk up the egg.. I suppose if I make them larger, then I run into a problem with the cost.. As the Tinman is the most expensive puppet, and making them all larger will make him more expensive.. I'll figure it out!
I can get better detail, and I can shoot the pictures from a distance. (though it's only slight)
Just something to consider.. That would put a hold on fabrication, because I'll need to scan and print the drawn versions.. Which will be okay!. I'll have all of my supplies, and things will go by quickly.. Don't have to worry about this guy!. Psst...
This is a secret... and I wasn't supposed to tell, but I hear you have a secret admirer...
No, the secret is that they admire you.. But I think you know them.... Spoiler... his name is Peter, and he has a huge crush on you!
I knew you would like it!. Mostly because you told me you would!
I wanted to flip through and pick out a poem for you, but I was more excited about giving it to you.
It was a dead give away after that!
I should have tripped you up by reading a different poem!
Just maybe!
Sweet dreams to you too!. I see you signed up for VtHacks.. Would you like for me to accompany you?
Wow! You're rhyming!. Good morning!. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Womens-American-Eagle-Outfitters-Corduroy-Skinny-Jeans-4-Purple-Cotton-Jegging-/331748983481?hash=item4d3dc7c2b9:g:Dd4AAOSwX~dWjsaM. I just realized that my pair of light gray pants are incredibly pink. No pants are safe!. (I'm not mad, I just find it funny)
That was you! :3
You don't have to :P. What size pants are you again?. Perfect size!
I didn't see the pants on the ae site.. But I saw plenty of joggers!
http://www.ebay.com/itm/American-eagle-hi-rise-jegging-corduroy-size-2-x-long-/182020127627?hash=item2a613ebb8b:g:~soAAOSwe7BWu9Zj. One day.... I hope you have a great day.
Thanks!. I love you, Leandra!
I had an extension to finish an essay (it was finished, but it wasn't good). And now I still don't have a decent essay, but the revisions are due today.. Hopefully not before 2pm.
Thanks!. I was sort of just writing the essay without citing anything, which is something you shouldn't do.. SO I need to do that as well.. It'll be okay though!. I'm sorry to just "toss" this on you.
:$. I'll keep at it.. I hope your day is going really well!. I love you!. Would you like to watch the last 4 episodes of Gravity Falls with me?
I still have time to work on the paper.. It's a little reorganized and revised though.
I kind of want to call it a day and work on more important projects though. I definitely got the sources down!. Thanks for believing in me! :3. Have fun in Defense Against the Dark Arts and Small Group!
^~^. I was doing homework with friends.
It's better than being alone :P
I think they're dancing.. And not getting tackled.. But we both know that dancing looks like you held in my arms being rocked around.
I'm glad you think so.. I'm currently thinking about the gauge of wire to use for the puppets.. I know that it's possible to use ball and socket jointed armatures, which are less likely to break, but they are more time consuming to make.. I'm worried the wire armatures won't survive.
He was very top heavy. But that's because he had a fairly large circle in his chest and thin supports in the legs.
I'm worried the lion might be just as heavy-- but will be supported by 4 limbs, instead of 2
We'll see.. I've scaled them up a bit, so I may need to find something other than the egg I have to make the lion.. I just cut limbs from a dowel rod for the scarecrow though.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Thank you.. I love you. Sleep well!
Good morning!
How is your day progressing so far?. Have fun in Game Design!
My day is going alright.. I've drawn the Wizard of Oz characters the way I want them for the book cover-- I think.. I just have to scan them in.. I won't be able to watercolor it just yet, but I'll pretend watercolor in photoshop.
She does have arms!. And a basket :P. I would show you right away, but it's having trouble loading up!
Thank you! (:. It's all drilled and ready to go.. I have to "thread" the dowel rods with wire and epoxy it together.. Then I can work on the stuffing, and then the clothes.. I'm still not sure what to dress him in.
For his face, but that's hard to replicate in small size :P. I was thinking blue jeans with a few patches and a blue long sleeved shirt.. I've been invited to "Trivia Night". So I'm going there tonight.. Goodnight and sweet dreams if I don't talk to you later!. I love you!
No problem!. What do you think?. It's a work in progress.
That doesn't sound very promising.
But you only like a portion of the front and back cover.. I hope your day is going well!. (hug)
I love you too!. Goodnight and sweet dreams! I wish I were able to help you pack!
But I'll be ready to pack for Spring Break!. !! I can tuck you in every night if you like!
I can get the ball rolling, but you should definitely have input.. You know.. since you're also eating.
Wow! I was thinking salmon packs! :P. Hey, we could make our own granola bars :P
We can have both :P
Sounds like you're less adventurous than I thought!. (Just kidding :P)
Unless we add our own dark chocolate?
We could bring a jar of peanut butter, since it's good for a quick treat.. Or we can spoon it into a baggy so that it's less bulky.
I would say yes, but I already purchased it.. I thought we were both buying it Tuesday, so that's what I did.
Are you sure? Were you planning on making a large purchase to get more cash back? Or something?
Wow. Will 50,000 miles get you another flight?
That sounds nice!
I do.
The referral redirects me to the main site.. Is that supposed to be the case?. I would have thought I would be sent to a sign up page.
I'm still ending up at groupon.com
Maybe you have a referral code I can enter when signing up?. Oh.. okay. I hope that works for you.. Okay, so at the manatee page I should "buy" the first or second option?
It was just a page asking for my name and email.
and click buy?
It's $55.
I was just confirming that that's the one.. The code does not work.. Sorry, the code can't apply to this purchase. Check the code's rules.
That wasn't even 15 minutes!. What do you want to do with me for the remaining five?
-$10
For GROUPON10. I cannot use NEWOFF (I'm assuming since I already used the first one)
I mean-- they won't work together.. It said it wouldn't validate it at this time.
PRES30 didn't work.. NEWOFF is -$10 also.
It is not a valid code.
Is there a difference between NEWOFF and GROUPON10?
I mean-- one said it was a special discount, while the other said it was a new member discount.
I'm ready.. Done.. Done.
I'm using GROUPON10, it's a "First Order Special Discount". You can keep me for however long you want.
:3
Just to confirm, 403 is the address?. Or is it not applicable?
Okay, just making sure!
Why did you derp?. We were having such a good moment!
Both of them are derps?. Oh, and order has been confirmed.. Are you deleting the messages now?
I still see them.
Uh oh :P
Right click what?
I can't do that.
That would explain why I couldn't do it on Facebook :P
1. Pull up Groupon with our mobile app (or print it out). 2. Appointment required, call (352) 563-0041 or 1-800-291-3483 and mention your Groupon. 3. Present Groupon upon arrival. 4. Enjoy!
Goodnight and sweet dreams.
!!!!. (hug)(hug)
Rawr!
Me too!. I'll try to learn manual soon-- most of the snow is melting, so I'll try to before the next snow hits.. Don't worry though!. Sleep tight!
So many worries if not.. I can't put you through that.
Sweet dreams, my one and only.. Or do you prefer Cutie Pie?
Okay! Sweet dreams, Cutie Pie!. :3
I love you!
Good morning!. How are you today?
I'm alright!. Checking Snapchat to see if you have any adventures posted!. Wow!!. Lake Michigan!
That's pretty cool!. I knew checking would be worth it!
!!!
Yeah.... It was the only sloth I saw.
Any time!. Don't forget I can contribute to design work!
Awesome!. You can bounce ideas off of me.
Go for it!. Simple does well!
Of course!. But you're going to rocket!. What would be the company name?. app name*
Touristar. :P. Or.. Tour-chure. The combination of tourist and brochure.
Oops.... I was thinking "Tour-sure". Tourister was the first thought.. But maybe there's a stigma to a tourist, and people prefer to be travelers.. Cicerone, sightseer, docent
I don't think you can just call it "Adventure". TripGuide could be a thing?. Or "Call to (Adventure)"
Adventure isn't very clear.. People might think they're going on a quest.. Trip Quest :P. But that sounds like MapQuest.. Call to Adventure?. You could have "Call to" really small above "Adventure"
Okay.. The sign up screen could cycle images of tourist destinations.
I think an account would be good, because it would keep track of your visits and whatnot.
And you can make plans with it. And you can list your preferences, and the app will cater your trips to it.. That's probably very difficult though.. I'm sure there are plenty of API's that are applicable though.
I'm available for more, if you want it.. I love you.
When I say I'm "available" I mean "I want to help, please use me!". "Put me in coach!"
Of course! And they have a short and simple name!. Except they made something for road trips in America, but you seem to be interested in making something more worldly.. So I think you have an idea different enough that you should be fine regardless if "Via" happens to be similar.. Good luck.. Don't forget about me :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I hope you're having fun.. I love you.. I'll be here for whenever you need someone to make designs-- unless you've found someone else for that. Good luck this weekend. I'm excited to see what you make, but I'll do my best not to distract you.
Oh! You have a team!. Do you need me to work tonight or tomorrow?
You win crayon points :P. Just an idea.
Sorry.. A bad idea.. I was just thinking that crayons are easy to create a recognizable icon for.. Let me know what you need.
Of course.. Good morning.
I'm ready to work.. Do you need a logo?
"is an* app". (Don't mean to nitpick with the typo though.). You could be a "Supply Pal". Also-- lending means that you will get the supplies back, but I don't think that's how the system is going to work.. It would likely be more of a donation.. Be the "Giving Tree" :P
Lend-a-hand could be a thing too.. I'm not sure if you would be infringing upon copyright laws by using Giving Tree.
Okay.. Well let me know which name the group decides on.. I can design for it.
I would not mind.
I'm fine with just being nice!
How do I make a return?
The links are not active to make a return.. However it said that I can make a refund within three days, and we ordered on the 18th.. I guess it counts as an event ticket, so we only had the day of the purchase to request a refund.
And request an exchange?. (Exchange the current groupon for two of the other groupons?. )*
I will make the call soon.. What art style would you like the images?. It doesn't give me a phone number to call and just a text box to type my problems. I'm not certain what to say, but so far I have: "The groupon expires before my trip and I would like to request a refund for this particular groupon, so that I may order one that won't be expired for when I use it."
Okay. I'll call them now.. Or after I get the mail.. Or now.. Probably now.
Uh oh!. I went to get the mail!. 20-30 minute wait time
I'm looking forward to seeing you too.. I'm still waiting on this call now :P. Want to tell me what kind of art you want for your app?
I left "1" so they're supposed to call me back.. Or they won't call back.. That could happen.. I called again, but I'm still on hold.
I'm not sure how that's supposed to help :P. It's been 24 hours, and it's not a local deal.
Then I'm supposed to call Monday? That's even out of the 3 day range for local deals.. You can go ahead if you like.
But there isn't an option to :P
I am.. pmattox2@radford.edu goingbackto1955. I've been given the confirmation email.
Just that they've received the request, that they usually get back within 24 hours, but it may take longer due to a high volume of requests.
Okay. That's good.
I was not.. Is this what you're looking for?. I draw better on paper, of course, so I might do that.
That's not a good reaction.
What do you imagine?
What does that mean?
"closed figures"?. I will gladly make whatever you tell me to.
Stick figures?
Oh.. I can draw them with crayons for that "added effect"
When do you need it by?. Would you like the thought bubble separate so you can add it wherever and however you want it?. Or just a thought bubble wishing he/she had crayons, but doesn't.. Also-- this is school, the place that advocates children to be creative, not "cleaner". Okay.. maybe a little bit cleaner.. What's my deadline?
But when's the latest/soonest you need it by?. And what about a logo?
Technology in the classroom? That sounds terrible.. :P. I'm mostly kidding.. I'm not sure how to illustrate that.. Glue = model of Eiffel Tower. But tablet = what?
Or a rocket ship?
Okay. I think I'm getting the idea.
So three frames: 1 dream, 2 receive tablet, 3 dream comes true. Dream being robot.
The classmates build a robot?. I don't know anything techy.
I just don't know what they kids would make.. Plus, I'm pretty sure at a young age, they want rocket ships and robots.
A bottle rocket does.. I don't know what you said, but this was my email:. Hi Peter, Sorry for any confusion! On the original screen where you made this purchase, http://groupon.com/deals/american-pro-diving-center-32-lakeland, we included a "Fine Print" section on the deal page. This section will always include all the conditions of a deal that you should know before making your purchase. In this case, the restriction in question is: "Promotional value expires Mar 1, 2016." If you have any further questions, please let me know. Regards, Semmichon YS Groupon Customer Support
That only applies to local events.. Which it is not.. I will email back, but I don't believe it will help.. Or I just jinxed it and it did help :P. It has been refunded.
Yup.. I know it's not great, but maybe it can be used as a placeholder?
I hope it's not too late!
No problem!. Sorry it still looks the same.. Anything else you need?
What would you like the logo to look like?
..... https://biladye.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/the-giving-tree.jpg. Like a stump?. Or the tree?. Something like this?
Do you want to use it?. Or would you like larger leaves?
Check your email-- Facebook converts it to a jpg. sent
You can't shrink it?
How large is that?
Okay, I sent two.
Just in case.
Sent again-- one at half and one at one fourth.. Did that help?. I hope it did.. Anything else?. It looked pretty small.. looks*
You're welcome!. I almost lost you in that phone call because my phone was dying!
Oh, I charged it up mid conversation!
Wow!
Aww!. Cute!
All swaddled up!. Just like the way I'll tuck you in the next time I get the chance!
(I meant to click the second one)
You'd have to be the one to click that first one :P. Because of metaphor.. Ahh! So cute!
All this time?
That hand is after you.
I did some design work for a classmate. They needed a flier, so I whipped one up for them.. They promised to pay me in cookies, but I was just doing it to be a friend.. I've built and felted the armature to the scarecrow.
Neat!. I have a bunch of illustrations to do though.. At least 6, but I want to do one for each chapter, which is 24.. But for the most part, the characters are finalized. I think Dorothy's face is what was off-putting for you.. Sleep tight!
Not yet, but I think the lips are what made you question her.. Maybe the eyelashes too.. At least that's what I think is what was bothering you.
Not tears!. I hope you're having fun~
We'll see!. You'll see my progress soon enough.. I hope to have fun, but I'm likely going to stay awake for much of the night!
Drawathon!
I'll get sleep later :P
What do you mean?. You're cool!
Oh, that's fine!. I'm terrible, and I've been procrastinating, so it's my fault.
I'll try!. Just 24 drawings!
:$. I was drawing the scarecrow all wrong!. He's supposed to be wearing an all blue suit.. I've gotta fix that.. I also gave him button eyes, but his eyes are painted on the sack that is his face.
It doesn't change my illustration much, just have to change the colors and his button eyes.
Mhmm.. I'm going to do 24 illustrations, but I feel like I need to do more.
24 for the opening chapters.. But more would be because it's a children's book.. There's a version of the Wizard of Oz that incorporates the images into the text.
I'll try to get the 24 done for now.. And I'll make the extra ones later.. Upon further inspection, he has button eyes :P. Except I've made him much taller than he should be.
Camping with you sounds like fun!. Is that you all bundled up!. And yes, I was reviewing the chapter.. Sleep well!. If you develop any kinks in you neck, be sure to let me know!. I can help fix them!. I love you, Leandra!. Sweet dreams.
(hug)
Happy Monday!. Where are you now?
Wow!. Good ol' terminal D.
That's good!
I'm in Radford.. The usual spot.. Have a nice flight!
(hug)
It'll feel so good I bet!. I can help too!. Wait.. no I can't...
By waiting for the next flight in the terminal?
You sure?
Tah tah for now!. Have a nice flight. See you next fall! :P. Rawr!. (hug)(hug)
I love you too!!!. I'm alright, how are you?
That's good!. Illustrations went slower than expected.. Are you still in transit?
Awesome!. Sounds like quite the adventure!. How was the sloth?. It sounded like a fun 15 hours.
Awesome!. Is it everything you thought it would be?. I'm fine just hugging you.. But hugging you in Costa Rica could be cool!
That's good!. I'm not sure when mine will come in, but I'm excited for it too!
But isn't a more fulfilling surprise if I don't know if it's there yet?
It says it will arrive Thursday.. You're looking stunning in those suspenders!. But you look stunning without them, so it's not really the suspenders.. I saw your "Good news". And it looks great!. I'm not sure what it will go to, but it's awesome.
I don't know what that stands for, but sounds exciting.. Good luck with the application.. I wanted to give you a phone call, but I'll let you do things!. Anyway. Goodnight and sweet dreams! You're probably exhausted!. I love you.
It's already tomorrow!. So right now! :P
Sure.
I just have class at 2pm-3:15.. So before and after works for me.. Pretend that I'm tucking you in super snug!
Sweet dreams to you too!. I can't tell what your snapchat is :P
That makes sense.. Good morning!
I hope you slept well!
Too well? That almost sounds bad!. I slept alright too. Had some strange dreams that I can't remember now :P. But at the time they were weird.. Have you been considering who to vote for for President?
It's important stuff :P. I'm currently reading up on Jill Stein.
She's running for the Green Party.. I haven't read too much about her, but her plan doesn't sound terrible.. I'd say it's "promising" but there's little chance many people have heard about her, which means she's unlikely to win.. I don't want to tell you she's "great" of course, because like I said, I don't know that much about her. She's just an alternative to the other candidates.
As a member of the Green Party, she wants America to be environmentally friendly by 2030. Have a great day.
Of course. I was actually going to suggest it.
Of course.. What's the website again?. I need to see when it closes and everything.
I am usually free on Fridays.
Of course.. Have a great day.
I love you!
(hug). (hug)(hug). (hug)(hug)(hug). (hug)(hug)(hug)(hug). (hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug). (hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug). Sorry for not having the card done sooner. I took care of it. Have a great night. I love you!
And I've made small purchases, which seemed to work, so everything is a-okay.. I've also gotten pretty far on memrise.
Self guided missile?. I want to be kissed by a manatee!. A self-guided tour sounds like fun!
Awesome.. I don't think it will be.. But I don't really know.
that doesn't sound so bad.. I will peruse eBay though!
I'm doing alright. How are you doing?. Just painting a picture.
Do you need a sword?. A shield perhaps?. Maybe a hug to regain your strength?
I'll be sure to give you some then!. Not that you weren't going to receive them anyway.
This weekend is the Addy awards.
I know.. I am not signed up for either currently.
I would, but I thought we were busy.
I can still give you design work, without the pressure of the hack.. I feel like I'd be a bit late to sign up.
What would I do?. I can offer design work.
That seems a bit dishonest.
I can contribute ideas without being a part of it.. You can sleep over at my house if you want a bed. It's a wee bit closer than your house.
No, of course.. That's fine.. I can be your ride then.
Won't be a problem!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I love you.. I can't wait for the weekend.
I'm all signed up for the Hackathon.
You're great!. Good morning.
I hope you slept well!. I whipped up another painting last night.
Thank you.. I just sent a picture of it to you.
Looks nice.
Awesome.. I think you made that picture 10% more Leandra.. But 100% more amazing!
You know me... that guy who likes to compliment you.. I just cut the mat for my duck painting-- I would have matted a different painting, but I've only got the three, and one isn't necessarily finished.. Have a great day today.
Okay, I resent it.
Thanks!. You can hardly see the mistakes I made.
I will do my best to do so.
I do have free time today, after my 4pm class (it ends at 6pm). $50 doesn't sound too bad to rent.. Ordering online may be tough, because I won't know how it fits on my face.
Hmm... It might be nice-- but I don't know how the suit will fit.
I guess there are measurements online.. http://www.scubapro.com/en-US/USA/wetsuits-size-chart.aspx
Would you like me to measure you before you make a purchase?
One you're comfortable in forever or one that's uncomfortable that makes you want to buy a comfortable one.. That's what you have to think about.
But then you're spending $80 on a comfortable one if you don't love it. I guess it's an excuse to measure you :P. Plus, you're going to need more weights if it's too big on you.. Which may be uncomfortable for diving.
I suppose I would be interested.
I don't know my size offhand.
I can do my own measurements, I just have to get my hands on measuring tape.
Is that so?. I didn't even measure my feet yet.
I was kidding :P
I know my shoe size :P. I guess things can run larger or smaller.. I can't remember the mask that everyone wore when diving.
It was black with a single lens for the eyes.. It looked comfortable.
I didn't wear them :P
http://www.amazon.com/Scuba-Choice-Spearfishing-Stainless-Classic/dp/B0092VBD5E/ref=sr_1_11?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1456342350&sr=1-11&keywords=scuba+mask. This one looks good :P. http://www.amazon.com/Hollis-Frameless-Diving-Freediving-Spearfishing/dp/B00361V0RW/ref=sr_1_24?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1456342350&sr=1-24&keywords=scuba+mask. Actually, this looks like the one.
Yes.. It's a bit pricey though.
The lowest I'm seeing it for is $74 or best offer.. This doesn't look so bad:. http://www.amazon.com/Cressi-Diving-Snorkeling-Freediving-Snorkel/dp/B0067BGZBE/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1456342350&sr=1-1&keywords=scuba+mask
I think the black ones look nice.. I'm worried about the mask sealing.
Reviews are saying that the mask did not create a seal and fogged instantly when entering the water.
Perhaps.
Oh. I. I'm sorry I wasn't available earlier*
I am busy until 6pm, my class starts at 4pm.
We'll be by the coast, there might be some nice sushi restaurants on the way.
When would you need it by.. I can make time for you, but I do have a big project that's taking a good amount of time.
I can try.
Okay.. I'll figure it out after I get some illustrations done.
I'm a bit worried about projects.. I have a project and an essay due the day after spring break.
Technically the project is due tomorrow at the latest, but it won't come in until next week, and then I won't have time to make corrections.
That sounds good.
I will too-- but some of my homework involves making stop motion puppets.
I have to place an order for my book project and it won't arrive after shipment until a week or so afterwards.
It's due the Monday after break.. But I have to order it, have it ship to my house, proof it, and order a new one if something was wrong.
Probably today.
So many things.. I'm starting to panic.
I'm not figiting.
I'm just getting worried because of all the stuff there is and the limited time to do it.
But I don't want to put it all on you.
Thanks. I sent that link to you before.. http://www.ebay.com/itm/2XU-Triathlon-Full-Wetsuit-Size-Small-Medium-Tall-/182030728633?hash=item2a61e07db9:g:fj0AAOSwG-1WyL5P. This is an option for a wetsuit if it's the right size.. http://www.amazon.com/NeoSport-Wetsuits-Premium-Neoprene-Zipper/dp/B000V9P73U/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1456345048&sr=1-1&keywords=scuba+boots. And I think these are the boots I wore before-- they were a size 9.
Jump sprites for?. Okay, no go then.. I can make jump sprites?
I can make them pretty quickly.
I'd be worried I couldn't fit those since I wore a 9.
Yeah, I wore a 9 and it fit.. I suppose it depends on how accurate the sizes are.
I would like to call you back, but I'm guessing you're already home!
Really?. I can wait-- We've got things to do.
Not cacao powder?. But whoa! What kind did you get?
Not special dark!. I just hear that stuff is added to give it the extra dark taste.
"bad stuff" is added.. Like chemicals.. I could be incorrect, of course.. I probably am.. https://www.groupon.com/deals/kurama-2. https://www.groupon.com/deals/aroy-jung-asian-fusion-1-1
Oops.
Oh, okay.. I'm not sure how to check places other than large cities.. I'm going to get back to work though. I have 5 resumes to create for tomorrow.
Might be an all nighter tonight.
I would rather not :P. I like my usual 6-7 hours :P
I found something!
Can I though? :P. Probably :P. But then it's off to the races Friday-Sunday :P
Do you mean Friday-Saturday?. Friday-Sunday is not an option for me.
I was not able to.. GROUPON10 was it?
Well that one didn't work. SALE3 applied though.
NEWOFF was not valid.. https://www.groupon.com/deals/lime-leaf-thai-restaurant-1. https://www.groupon.com/deals/dim-sum-room. https://www.groupon.com/deals/jaxmint-indian-restaurant. https://www.groupon.com/deals/fuji-sushi-16545255. https://www.groupon.com/deals/fuji-sushi-6040808
I have only checked the proximity of each.. https://www.groupon.com/deals/pho-a-noodle-bar-2. I know how you like Pho.. The Pho looks fairly affordable.
Which options are enticing you?. Was it the Indian food?. Or the sushi?. http://www.openfu.us/menu.html. The sushi doesn't look too expensive-- but I'm not sure how much it usually goes for.
I think you like sushi, so I might go sushi?. The rolls are around $2.75 (for four pieces)
The raw fish roll is $2.75.. Value is $20, save $8.
There's also Hibachi Grill for $5.45.. $5.25*. However, the groupon is for specialty rolls and nigiri.. The Indian Restaurant doesn't sound bad either, if you wanted that for the way back.. There are two coupons for Sushi X. I kind of want a yes before I order it.. Never mind-- if you change your mind I'll just cancel the order.
Can I play?
Thank you! (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I love you!!!
(I look like this before I'm about to sweep you off your feet-- usually without the flower)
Oh no. That's so personal.. I'm 5'9" (I think) and 135 lbs (I also think)
The first is SP?. They say it's a women's small?
Ah.
And that's an appropriate size for me?
Okay.. Umm. I was thinking I was going to nap until 2:38. I'm feeling a bit tired, but I still have more work to do.
They both look nice.. The Bare suit is buy it now, which means it will ship sooner.. The Evo looks nicer though.
I'll be back in a few!
Good morning!. I love you! I hope you have a great day today!
Thank you!. Am I still needed to take your car to Radford?
Are you sure?. Has it already been taken care of?
Did you not trust me?. What kind of cookies would you like?. I'm getting paid in cookies :P. I only needed 3 resumes!
I think they will be making them!. So what kind would you want them to make?. Did you receive an email from vthacks? I haven't received any form of confirmation.
Yes cookies? I'm not sure if there's a recipe for that, but I'll see.. I love you, Cutie Pie!. I hope you're having a wonderful day!
They're using organic milk, I don't think they want to go out to buy groceries specifically for me-- otherwise they would have just paid me in cash.. Sleep well.. Doorknob.
Any time.. I didn't want to eat them alone.. I feel unwanted and undesired.. But that's okay.. I can transfer that money to you.
The way you were acting did not make me feel welcomed or loved.
Why did you feel bad?
No, the way I feel doesn't matter.
I was excited to see you today, but I didn't feel like you were all that excited for me. Why did you feel bad?
It felt that you wanted to leave pretty quickly.
From me.
Because you wanted to leave.. Sleep well.. I would nap too, but I don't think I will.. You don't need me any more (not that you ever did.)
Good morning.
It's me.. When are you ready?. I'll have to get ready myself.
And eating breakfast would be good.. I can make banana muffins.. I've got those extra ripe bananas :P
I can take you to that.. Does a microwave muffin or banana pancakes sound okay?
I think I'll have time to pick you up.
That sounds doable.. I'll let you know if I take any longer.
I hope your travel was safe.
That's good, because you're about to see a lot of me.
Four days :P. Do you think you'd want popcorn on an open fire?. It would be the unflavored kind you get in bags.
Cool.. I might have purchased some :P. It was on sale :P
What can I say? I'm a 60 year old man.. But I wanted to check it out before I knew it was on sale.. I thought it might be a good snack for camping.. (if we're allowed to build a fire). We might not be able to.
Neat.. It could be nice.. Will you want me to bring anything specific?
I was thinking of something specific, but I'm going to assume no.. But please give me a list!
Okay. I have a list going on from things you've told me previously.. I think I still have the lighter fluid from our previous camping trip.
At least I should.
Oh, I can make a few phone calls and transfer the money to you.. I have one of those.. Should I bring an eye mask?
I'm not sure.. It's only if you want me to wear it.
I just recall you wanted me to wear one before. I wasn't sure if you would want me to do the same again.. I'll assume no.
It wasn't uncomfortable when you asked me to the last time.. It's okay. I assume you are not interested.. You don't have to be, of course.. I'll make sure to stay on "my side" of the bed/tent.. Anyway-- I'm going to drop it now.. Good luck on your homework.. I can go to the store to make grocery purchases, if that would allow us to leave sooner.
I don't think I would need one other than if you wanted me to wear one.
Yes, but if you cannot arrive Thursday night, then I can make purchases.
Okay, sounds good.. Let me know, and we can determine a list and I can have it ready for when you come over.. I will bring an eyemask just in case, but I don't think I'll see much use in it.. Might be good to have for when we go to Japan though.. I don't happen to have all that many pairs of shorts. I might have to go purchase some.. Predicted thunderstorms on the 11th and 12th (Thursday and Friday). I hope that doesn't affect anything.
I have access to those things.. I can ask my brother in the morning.
Where will we be diving again?. The prediction is for Jacksonville, so we might be okay.
I just don't have it memorized :/
I don't have an itinerary.
I know.. I remembered.
It's not something that searches in "weather.com"
No.. That's not searchable.. I think that's just a "moniker"
Thursday-Saturday a 60% chance of thunderstorms.. So it was a different forecast.. I just checked out Key Largo.. Then I checked Tavernier.
I was just thinking it might be good to check.. It could always change, of course.
Sweet dreams to you too.. Good morning.
I hope you slept well!. Watercolor class has been canceled today because of the Donald Trump speech.. (Canceled because of how difficult it will be to get to campus will be)
The seats were sold out the day of.. Most people going are going in protest.. So likely the protest is disrupting traffic.. "I was surprised to learn that Leap Day was a tradition that originated long ago in Ireland. On this day, women were allowed to ask a man for a date or for their hand in marriage; contrary to the usual tradition of women waiting patiently for men to ask them on a date, or for his hand in marriage. In the United States, the Leap Day phenomenon was documented as early as the 20th century. Slate Magazine features some vintage postcards dedicated to warning men about the hazards of accepting female visitors on Leap Day.". In short-- it's Sadie Hawkins Day, so now's your chance :P
It is indeed.. You knew and you didn't ask me anything?. I'm shocked :P
I've never seen or heard of that movie.
I've never played harvest moon.
Also I'd probably pick a guy.. For class?
I have Super Metroid II for the Gameboy, if that would work.
Good news!
A class is promoting illegal activity?. That's strange.
I don't think it is :P
Can I also play for homework?
I don't have the link you have.
But google leads to illegal activities, when a school sanctioned link is slightly less illegal.
Then you could just pull it up on NESbox
I already found it-- and I thought the link had a NESbox and SNESbox-- but I don't see it any more.
(I think it was a thing, but it's been removed). Talk to you after midnight.
You've got this.. I can help you start, if you need.
I know.. I have 3 magazine covers to design.
Of course. I'm ready to inspire you.
What are you getting started on?
I don't know what that means :P. But you're a model, so you must understand.. I don't mean to offend when I say that, of course, because I think you're much more than that.. I was trying to be cute :P
I didn't want to upset you!. So I was clarifying.
I respect you, dude.. Anyway-- I can definitely pump your bike tires.
Is there anything else you may need?. I can buy the nonperishable foods.
Extra 20% off on Groupon: CLEAR20. You can use it up to 3 times.
For clearance items.. I gotta read the fine print next time.. We would just be staying until the 7th?
How far away can it be?
What's the price range?. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6705366?checkin=03%2F06%2F2016&checkout=03%2F07%2F2016&guests=2&s=aA8rVc7m. How does this look?
This: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11544362?checkin=03%2F06%2F2016&checkout=03%2F07%2F2016&guests=2&s=aA8rVc7m. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6395110?checkin=03%2F06%2F2016&checkout=03%2F07%2F2016&guests=2&s=8Nh71EJ3
I have more places in my tabs.
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4271180?s=F6PuLUM1. $42, but it doesn't show hidden fees-- so they might be there.
Oops.. It must have reset my specifications.. This one is $45: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9077407?checkin=03%2F06%2F2016&checkout=03%2F07%2F2016&guests=2&s=nPqLDs2j
Yes, that's what I was thinking.. Anything else you need?. You need the voucher for Fuji Sushi.
I can go on the hunt
I do have more pressing matters, but they'll get done :P. It's not as important as time spent with you.
Sounds fine to me!. I wanted to transfer those funds to you, however, the card I received on Saturday is now deactivated because I entered the correct code, but it didn't recognize it as such.
I suppose-- but I'm a little upset about it.. I'm not liking this bank.
National Bank (of Blacksburg)
I might transfer all of my funds into my Capital One account.
Unless you're the devil on my shoulder and it's the wrong thing to do!. Kidding of course.
Dun dun dun!
Rawr to you!
An attack with tackles???. That's like a double attack!
Eep!. Are you going to tackle me in real life too?
I'll brace myself then.. If you need to practice your battling skills too, I can be your punching bag.
But you like punching me.. :P
They're asking if you are going to be going either before or after.. So perhaps they're asking, because Sunday isn't a good day for them.. Like: "Are you going to be traveling through Jacksonville before Sunday? Because we would love to see you, but we're busy then."
(Just one of many interpretations)
Or it just wasn't clear the first time, and they want clarification.
Good morning.. I love you! Have a great super busy day today!
Anything you want me to pick up at the store?. I was thinking of going today. I can get non-perishables.. I already have the salmon/chicken packets on a list of things you wanted.
Anything else?
I will check.. (when I'm there). I haven't gone to the store yet-- I'm waiting on more things to put on my list.
The one in Blacksburg.. South Main.. It has a pretty large natural food section.
Oh I know it.. So? Chia seeds, nuts (almonds?), peanut butter?
I understand, I just thought I could pick up some non-perishable food.
The tent fits in the backpack.
It's prepacked for later :P. Microwave muffins, huh?. I don't have the ingredients you have :P. How do dates sound?. That jar of cashews is available.
Okay.. Any last minute adjustments before I go to the store?
I don't believe you, but okay.. I'm back from the store.
Mhmm.. I got a few packets of salmon and chicken.. Some mixed nuts and other delicacies.
Sure.. Sorry that the phone call couldn't have been better.
It was just your tone of voice, which might have been caused by you thinking you were making me feel bad.. It was just concerning, nothing bad.. Anyway... goodnight and sweet dreams.
You've got this!. (points to self)
Sleep well.. I might need to buy a pair of shorts for our trip :P. How many days are we camping?
Okay, just checking. Thanks.. I guess I could have deduced it from the gap between the airbnb stops.
I'm sorry for not having things written down.
I took a quiz and "I side with Jill Stein on most 2016 Presidential Election issues" was my result.
http://www.isidewith.com/ I'm not sure how reputable it is.. I won't get into too much detail, but my answers sided with hers 83% of the time.. Have you heard a band called "Oh Wonder"?. I'm not positive, but you might like them.. I've also been listening to Nothing But Thieves.
I guess you might find Oh Wonder to be a bit slow.
Just trying to get you through your day.
It looks really cute.
They were created for a single purpose.. To hug all the things.. Everything that goes into the water is in danger... of receiving hugs!. They will find you... and they will hug you.. I'm going to print the groupon for Fuji Sushi.
Mine is also free.. So I already took care of it.. I can print more.. It would probably be easier for me, because the free printer is in my classroom.
You can send me anything you haven't printed yet.. And I can take care of it.
Oh, okay.. I hope you had a nice day today.. (hug). Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I think I will be too.. Good luck!
The magazine and leave behinds.. What are you working on?
It's something I leave behind after an interview.
Yeah. I have 3 to come up with.. I meant to practice driving more tonight, but Scott was busy. Do you think tomorrow will be too late?
I really wanted to make things easier on you.
Oh.. Okay.
Okay. I'll do that after class.
Okay. Was it the Cressi brand?
Thanks.
They have scuba masks and snorkels, but they don't have a set.
That's what I meant, actually.
I hope so as well.. I'm probably going to get this: http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=23122226&cp=4406646.4413993.19248926.19572776&categoryId=19701526
Just based on the reviews on the website.. I suppose I could check amazon.
I'll be sure to call.. I've got creative block for these leave behinds.. Good morning.. Have a nice day today!. I hope you aren't too stressed.
You've got this.
I've gotten much less picky over the years, so I'll try anything at least once.. The only thing I've gotten picky about is when things are too salty!
Sounds great!. It actually sounds really exciting.
I'm getting close. That sounds awesome.
Awesome.. I can ride my bike over.
Okay, that's fine then.. I was thinking of wearing pants and a nice shirt tomorrow because I'm meeting your cousin.. Are there any me specific things I should bring?. Like a cooler?. Do we still need bungie cords?
I have the tent... Sure. What do you need?
That's fine!. I thought you were going to need me to write it.. That's good though, you can help me decide what we need from my house before we go to yours.
Let me check.. There is not, but the driveway across the street where I usually park is available.. But I can park there and there will be room for you in the back lot.. You can park in the back!
Cool.
(hug)
I love you too!!!!1. How are you right now?. Are you all packed and ready to go?
Wow! Really?. I could see you then?. That would be cool.
!!!. That would be awesome!. I was thinking about heading to Radford soon. Do you think I could see you before I go>. ?*
That would be great!. Only if you want!
Wow! Me too!. Still have any homework to work on?
So... yes?. Or do you just want to sleep more?. You are probably super tired!
Awesome!. I will be ready soonish. Would you like me right over?
Cool!. I'll make sure I don't forget anything.. I have a few things here and there.. But as soon as I have everything, I'll be right over.
That is fine!
Yeah, that's fine!. Oh-- let me make that transfer!. I just need your info!
I have a Wells Fargo account ending in 3670 in my external accounts.
Right :P. This is a Capital One account?
Can you check and confirm?
Yes.
I understand. I just want to be safe!. I'm ready to go! Are you ready to receive?
Awesome!. I'll be red rover then!. I'm all safe.. Good morning!. Did you sleep well?
You left it with me, but I gave it back to you-- so I thought it was in the car.
You did leave it with me and it was in my pocket after we filled up, so you didn't leave it at the gas station.
No, I took it out of my pocket and gave it back to you when we got back into the car.. I was just letting you know that I had it, in case you thought you left it.. had had* it.
Thanks, you too!. (hug). (hug)(hug). I hope you had a really great day today!. I made spaghetti for dinner tonight.
It has fresh roma tomatoes, carrots, and chicken in the sauce.
Mhmm!. We'll see how good it actually is!. I've been slaving over it for a while :P. Just gotta top it off with lettuce.. It's pretty delicious.. I wish you could share it!
I didn't have any raisins-- but I thought about them!. The chicken was boiled, and it tasted pretty good in the sauce!. I love you!
I used tomato soup, because I didn't have any sauce-- but it worked about the same :P. I wanted to add mushrooms, but I didn't have any.. Good morning!. I hope you aren't too stressed today (I know you handle it well, but you've got a lot to do)
Mhmm!. You've got this!
It's happening!. o.o. I love you!. I hope you had a great day!. I've been thinking about you.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
It's you!. (hug). Never mind :P. Sleep tight!. I don't know how or when, but I really hurt my toe today.
Good morning!
I hope you have a great day today!
You're going to be back for "Bring your own cup" to 7-11 :P
It's in celebration of it's 50th anniversary.. You can bring your own cup.. And the cup can be anything :P. As long as it's 10" in diameter.. It sounds like too much though :P
You fill it up with slurpee flavors.
No, sorry.. Though I wouldn't want 7-11 hotdogs :P
:P. Just slurpee :P. Gummy bears would be cool though.. Hide them under the slurpee.
Rawr!!
Eep!
I'm not scared-- I'm ready for you!
You can take your violent tendencies out on me, don't worry about that :P
:3
I love you too, Leandra!
It's looking like essay writing, and portfolio spread making.. And a little bit of magazine developing.
I'll be rooting for you too!. What is your day looking like?
Interesting.... Any news on the video game?. I'm totally ready to help with sprites!. I'll ease your burden so that you can get more work done.
Awesome!. It can be a little weekend project!. Or we can just hang out and have fun.
You sound like fun to me!!!. (hug)
He's an actor.. He was Harry Osborn in the first Spiderman Trilogy.
He stars in a bunch of inappropriate movies.. I think he started acting in a show called "Freaks and Geeks". Oh-- he was in the movie Oz the Great and the Powerful.. I found that out before my book project, but it reminded me of it.
Whoa! I didn't know that!. That's neat.
:P. Are you going to enter the Price is Right?. I feel like I'd be really bad, because I don't know prices on things.
But you could win....... a new car!. Not that that's important :P
Like which ones?
Do any of those really compare to being crowded in an audience with the off chance of being called to "come on down"?. I happen to have a drawer of those items of which you speak.
Sure!
Except not borrow :P. You're going to have to keep it :P
They're just in an art box collecting dust because of my mom and sister.
I'm always a Sunday option :P
That's me: "Sunday Option"
Oh.. right.. But "Sunday Option" is my middle name.
I can totally get these illustrations done.. Like super soon.. I get these bursts of creativity that push me through :P. I gotta get this essay done too though, so I'll get on it.
Not at all :P
That would be fantastic!
Me too!. You'll get plenty of hugs too, as long as you want them!
I would definitely love to have you longer! (:. Saturday at 2pm is less than any amount of measurable time.. You'd pretty much not visit :P
And then I can keep you!
!!!!. Awesome!. (:. Did you want to try the Lebanese food in Blacksburg?
Okay!. I can help make food then!
om nom!. I'm having a tough time writing this paper.
I don't!. But thank you!. I didn't make it in on time. I'll try to finish and email it to her.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
It doesn't :p. She wants a paper copy, but that'll be okay.. Good morning@. !*
Hello, cool kid!
What's up for today? I know Thursdays are typically your busy days.
I'm working on spreads for my flatbook (it showcases my portfolio) and I have the essay to turn in (a paper copy). I think for the most part I'm going to be working on publication homework for the rest of the day-- maybe a dash of stop motion puppet fabrication splashed in the mix.. Oh-- I have a midterm today too!
You're more to me than just a midterm buddy!. You're my best friend, and an awesome carrot!
Unless you find a ride, otherwise, yes.
Oh, well I definitely want to see you.. And for as long as possible-- so it's more than okay.
Whenever you need to return.
I do have class at 1pm Mondays-- but it's just watercolor.
Fine... fine... If you say so..
That's fine by me.
I think the latest we could leave on Monday is 8am.. I can probably be late for class, because my teacher is very lenient.
Then 7:30am :P
We can always leave Sunday night.
But like I said, my watercolor teacher is fairly lenient.
So if I'm a bit late, it won't hurt so much.. Especially since I haven't missed a day yet.. Plus if I email her now, she'll at least know before the trip :P. 7:30 is a bit early for some people though.. I need to run to class, but I think between 7-8am would be a good time frame.. 6-6:30am at the earliest.
Wow!. Right when you thought it wouldn't happen :P. Ahh! What happened?. Self destruct?
To drive you back?. Or is that your ride back?
If that's what you want to do, but it's fine if you want me to take you and if you want to see me for a longer amount of time.
What if I have shoe string?
I do have white yarn.. Are you making lil' booties?. I might have brown or black though-- I don't know.. I assumed you needed shoe string because you need shoe color.
You're perfect!
Paige has knitting needles, but she may also have a crochet needle hanging around.. Paige confirmed that she does.
Don't thank me :P. It'll be Paige who's helping the most.
I'll tell her when I see her.. I love you!. I can't wait to see you too.
Take your time (:. (hug)
Ahh!. You self-destructed again!!. (You're not an angry bird, but it was the only explosion I saw). Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Goodnight, Leandra!. I hope to hug you bunches when you visit!
As long as you want!. Good morning!. How was Kroger?
That's good.
I do not mind.. You are welcome to at any time. I can start looking too.
No problem.. I'm not having any luck either.. You're welcome to stop by though.
Gas station, my house, then your house.. Including your car, there are four places it could be.. I'm positive that I left the gas station with it, so we have three places to search.
I don't think it ever made it up to my room-- in fact, I don't think it made it into my house.. I would like to help you look, of course.. I'm going to go to Mish Mish now though, to make a return.. Never mind-- I'm going to go tomorrow.
It closed at 6
I can help you look-- four eyes are better than one.
better than two*
Makes sense to me.. Would you like another set of eyes?
I can be over in 5-10 minutes, is that okay?. (yes, no?)
Okay! I'll see you in a bit. Should I bring anything?. Popcorn?. :P
Oh, I already have that ready to go :P. Anything else?
I love rotten cabbage!
I would love to!. Anything I should bring before I come over?. Anything at all?. You can stop looking for your wallet.. I was wrong about it never coming into my house :P
It fell between my bed and the wall.. It was obscured by a pillow too.
It really didn't want to be found.
Don't thank me. It was an accident really :P. I just went to unplug my laptop, and there it was.. I'm going to leave now-- you haven't told me to bring anything else.. so I'm going to assume I'm okay.
Hello.. I hope you're safe.
I have the left/right walking sprites, the forward/backward walking sprites, and the left/right/up/down net swinging sprites.. So that means the playable character is ready.. What if the students throw you upgrades so you can (defeat?) your teacher.. You should play Bubble Bobble!. Or Kirby's Adventure!. Oh, and I've made the disks spin.. I'll organize the sprites and send them over.
No problem!. What colors did you want the chips to be?. Blue, red, and yellow?
Okay, got it!. I love you.. I've sent the things.
Missing me already?. Don't worry-- I'm missing you too.
That sounds awesome!. For a moment I thought that it was going to be one of those sleeper pods.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
(hug)
Rawr to you!. What makes you say such sweet things?
:3. I'll get you the teacher sprite soon!. With throwing action.. Then I'll work on classroom assets.
Wa :P. Sweet dreams to you too!. The raccoon dog!. Is it similar to a tanooki?. tanuki*?
Wow!. It's cute!
Just imagine me tucking you in!
I love you!. Night night!!
Good morning!. How does this look?
I can't give your teacher hair :(. The sprites are the same size as Lily though.. Though a bit shorter.. The pixels scaled fairly well when I did 200%, will that be okay?. (So it should be easy, and easier on me, to make them the small size, then scale them the larger size). Just let me know! I can try 300% and 400% as well.
The sprites are about 20x20 pixels each.. Depending whether or not they have a net.
The super nintendo was 16x16 pixels.. and the nes was 8x8. And those scale fairly well.. I can scale it up, but like I said, it's the same size as the Lily sprites.. And you were able to scale that up without seeing anything blur within the game.
Lily is 16x24. So you want the sprites about 2 times as large.
Okay, that's just twice as large.. But you want them even larger than that, right?
1.5 times?. So would you want me to just make them 3 or 4 times larger?
14x20 (There's 2 more pixels making 16, but it's just hair). 28x40 if I double it.. 42x60 if I triple it.. 48x80 if I quadruple it.
56*x80. I can do both.
It's going okay. I'm getting very behind on the magazine I have to make, which is concerning.. How is your day going?
I know the feeling!
Really?. Okay! That's the look I'll go with.. It's largely based on an actual lion.
https://a4-images.myspacecdn.com/images03/30/b58ec9cd682f4bdf8d19118bd1b8f83b/300x300.jpg. Lions have fairly triangular noses, but I'm unfamiliar with the Ferocious Beast of which you speak of.
I'll look into it.
It's not difficult to erase and redraw.. I'll send you the modified nose.
No, I think you're right. It looked a bit off.
Okay, cool!. I think it looks better too, so thank you!
Hopefully it won't look weird standing next to the tinman and the scarecrow.
I added the x2 and x3 files.. Here's a more "top down" view of a head.
Is the most recent one better?
That's strange, because I made sure that they were 1 pixel apart.. Oh!. Which net sprites? Because I corrected a few and they are closer together than before!. I saw issues with the other net sprites, but we should be good now.. I sent you the updates.. Please let me know what you want changed for Floryan.
No problem!
As soon as you approve of a Floryan, I can make the throwing animation (He should only be rotating to face you, right?)
So the full rotation?. All eight sides?. Will his also be throwing from that angle?
So just throw forward?. And is this one okay?. This one is a little more modified:. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I'm finding it difficult to realize the side, but I'll figure it out!. I love you too!
I ron't!
I'm just me :P. Are you sure you like it?. I can still make revisions.. He could look like this:
But what if...
Even the body? and the arms?. And the feet? The feet are probably too small.. Is it the head?. Is the head the part you like?
You sure?. It's just really hard to get the profile :P
The head was the problem :P. But I suppose the body didn't help :P. Goodnight.. Sleep tight!. I'll try to figure out the angles too.. Let me know what you think of the back and sides.
I needed to make the torso about the same as the front, because that allows for an easy rotation.
But he could probably be this much skinnier?. I think it looks a bit better.
That makes sense-- I do too, but I was worried it blended too much with the glasses.. I'll get the angle ones done later today, and then I'll work on the throwing.. I should be done after that-- for now I have a quick project proposal I need to work on, and I need to prepare things for the art show (I found out yesterday that it's required to turn something in, and the deadline is today)
It's specifically for Publications.
It's okay, he becomes the king of the beasts!. I hope you're doing well too!
The three paintings I set off to make today are finished.. I want to show you as soon as they are scanned in!. What's my deadline to give you Floryan Sprites?
Even smaller than the small ones I made?
I've sent a screenshot!
Of course-- I was just trying to send everything all at once.
Okay... :P
:3. I'm glad you think so!. The Floryan sprites are coming your way.. It's up on Google Drive!
Sure!. I'm not up to anything in particular.
You sure?
Laughter makes me think otherwise :P
Well it's filler for now-- I fixed a few parts.. And he still needs his throwing arm.. Is he left or right handed?. This is the angled sprite.. His eye gets slightly lost, but that's what happens.
Well is he right or left handed?. Because I'm going to go right-- but if he's left handed, then that'll be embarrassing.
Okay, that's what I'll do then.. I'll try to get you some more sprites!. I'll listen to some music while I work.
Aw man.... If only we were going to France!. But that's okay. I can wait until we're alone.
Wow!. And I never knew!. The angled walk is coming together nicely.
And it's finished!. Maybe next you can help me with my game :P
I don't know.. mine is pretty complicated :P. Sweet dreams to you too!. I'll get on the throwing sprites.. Or would you want the classroom first?. Maybe the hallway and the vending machine?
Good morning!
*tackled*!. *going down*. *explosion*. What kind of floor and back wall?. Would a tiled floor and a while board work?
I meant to say "Whiteboard". I don't know what your classroom looks like :P. It could be carpet for all I know.
I thought I'd make doors at the back of the class.. So the player sprite walks in, and the boss falls from the sky :P. I was thinking you could have an intro where the students funnel in and take their seats.. I bet it's part carpet part wood floor.
So all the students funnel in, and the player is the last to come in-- so I'll need to leave one seat empty.
Should I make this as an animation?. Oh-- so you would make it?
I would just need walking sprites for all of the students and you would need to make an animation where the student pulls the chair out to sit down.. I can mock that up so you know what it would look like.
I don't think it would be too hard.. The chair scoots a few pixels back, student sits as the chair scoots to original pixels.
Okay :P. The chair should rotate as it comes back so that it's a more natural transition into the chair.. Got it.,. Heard you loud and clear.
Home already??. That's so soon!. Have a nice shower!
Not too soon for me, but for you :P. Color of chairs?. I guess I can change it later :P. I just sent a student sitting in a chair.. Sending the table over. This is how I have the classroom set up:. The red is the available walking path.. There is room, however, between the two tables.. In case you were worried about that.. I cleaned up the available walking spaces. And with Floryan in the mix.. I never added shadows!. Would you like those?
Oh, I thought it was a table.. The table is a separate asset.. The image is just to give you an idea.
I made a smaller desk.
Would you like shadows?
It wouldn't be too hard?. If you would like them, I can add them?. I left the table in the assets so you can have it.. I'm not sure about the floor tile, but you can use it temporarily.. So they were tables!. All along.
And your teacher is even wearing his signature plaid.. Your classroom has such bland colors :P. Now this is the kind of classroom I'd want to be in.
Where are his glasses??. I designed a man wearing glasses, but in that picture I see no glasses!. Do I need to design his desk too?. I was thinking he could come from the sky and land on the desk so that it explodes.. That would explain why it wouldn't be there.
Wouldn't it though!. So much fun!. I gotta go shower!. Just like you a bit ago :P
The Floryan sprite doesn't look menacing enough :P. You should sneak pictures of his face.. And I'll make him boss material.
What do the TA's look like?
What? :P. Are you sure you want the classroom to look that bland?
You got it!. Fall backward or fall to the side?
I can do both, and you can use them at your discretion.. I think falling to the side might be funny if I made them raise a hand as if they're fainting.. Fall backwards would also be funny too.. Should they spin then fall?
Okay.
Sounds great!. I have yet to schedule an appointment at the post office.. I suppose you could say things have been fairly busy, but I probably should have gotten that out of the way.
It shouldn't be hard to find the number.
Grain or not to grain?
Adding grain isn't hard :P
I can just make four or eight variations.
Thinner which way?
Okay, but it's top down perspective.. Don't forget that :P. This much thinner?
The one I just showed you just happens to be that size.
I think it would be best moved a tad bit down though.
I'll send you the tables soon.. I'll work on the classroom wall.
I heard that the customer service at the particular post office in Radford is not very good.. A lot of complaints from people.. (I heard it from the googlevine)
No-- I was just going to call the one in Blacksburg.
Don't look now, but I'm sending you the tables now.
Also I'm in class.
Yep. The tables are on the drive.. Have fun with Floryan. Is he going to advise you on your game?
Tah tah for now.. Stay close to the google drive.. Assets are going to be popping up left and right.
Are there two doors into the classroom?
I see. You wouldn't be able to see that one.. Might have to take some creative freedom.. I was going to make the clock spin.. I'm still not sure about the carpet.
Should I start sending you assets?. Or do you want the wall and everything all at once?. Like as a single background-- because I made things separately.. When was that demo?. I'm sorry for not having a background yet.
Okay!. The door technically needs an open and close animation.. Purple floor okay?. I was going to make the projector retractable, the doors have an open/close animation, and have the clock move.. Door animation has been added.. I made a "falling back" sequence.. Visiting this weekend would make sense, because your mother is on Spring Break, unless she visits you!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. How many students do you think you'll need?
Got it. I've got the "generic" yellow one doing most of the action so far.. I should probably make another boy, and two girls.. Just to keep everything balanced.. Do you think you'll have a "character creator"?. I know we have the main playable sprite and everything, but you could make it so that people can customize-- unless you just want to have unlockable characters.
Omit what?. The unlockable characters?. Should I remove the other door and place it where it actually is in the back of the class?
Yeah, that's fine-- I just thought that people wouldn't want to be confined!. Unlockable characters would be good though.. At the very least.
Maybe you have to defeat a digital enemy on the projector?. The doors have to open to let the students in,. You told me you wanted a falling animation (still working on the other one). And a clock just makes it more "realistic"
He's still on the chair.. I gave you a preview animation before I made the chair :P. But the sprites with the chair should be up on the drive.
Maybe I can make a green bubble animation that comes from his mouth which would play after?. Or if I make it you can do what you need to.
It would just be green bubbles floating away from him.. Really??. I want some!
I'm not sure about seeing you, but talking to you in the morning will be nice!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I finished the second kind of falling. I included both the left and right directions. I mocked up the falling, and I only used about half of the sprites (about every other one), but I included all of the ones I made just in case.. I've also made the poison bubbles.. It didn't save properly. Again :P
Good morning!
Another day closer to the next that I'll see you :3
What??!?!?!?!?!1111/1/1/1. @!#!#)()!#!@!. Explosion!!!. I mean.. ehemmm. That's cool I guess.. (actually really cool)
(hug). (hug)(hug). So throwing sprites? Are there any other miscellaneous things I need to get to?
Well I need to do the throwing, and then the variety of students.. But you have the falling animations and the poison affect.. So As soon as I get you a throwing animation, you might have "everything". I suppose I could include a bounce in that falling animation that I sent you.
Is that bad?
You too!. I have one throwing animation down.. I'll get the other ones soon.
You have the front throw.. At the very least.. It looks a bit off, but it'll do for now.. It's on the drive now.. Remind me to resend Floryan, his back sprite was missing a pixel.. Or I'll send everything with the throwing sprites.. I made half of the throwing sprites. I'm not sure how they'll animate, but I don't think I did a very good job with them.. I sent them to you too, so you have them.. I finished the last ones.. They're available to you for whenever you need them now.
No problem!. The same goes like I said before-- I'm not sure how they'll animate.. But I hope it works!. There's an art show tomorrow night.. You've seen what I put in, but I'm going to go.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I would, but I'm not certain of the time.. I think it's 7pm.. It is 6pm, but that doesn't mean you can't come late (If you want to come, of course)
Oh, of course. Well I can pick you up wherever you need me to.. And then I can take you home.. I'd probably be heading to Blacksburg myself anyway.
Yes.. Part of my would be worried that people don't stay at those shows for very long-- but that's fine with me!
It doesn't.. For some reason I was thinking that it'd just be closed :P. But it won't get that late.
It should be fun... what do you say?
Awesome!. :3. Sweet dreams to you too!. You can see the originals as welL!. well*. Oh yeah! the hallway and the vending machine need to be made. I'll wait for the weekend though.. Hey! Looks just like you!. Just kidding.. Though the two of you both look very cuddly.
Wow!. I knew it! :3. Let me know where you plan to be dropped off and when. I'll be there to sweep you away.. Good morning!. Would you be interested in going to Joann Fabrics?. I need to go to get materials for my stop motion puppets, but if you wanted to go to get materials for your barefoot shoes, then that would be cool!
Oh, that's okay!. Enjoy the doughnuts!. I can pick up the material for you, if you would like!
We could make really thin sandals.. They would have little support, and your feet would likely still hurt from gravel, so it's like the same thing, but they have bottoms so it's a more believable shoe.
Well what would happen if I did it anyway?. Would you wear it?
Depends on what?
Aw man.. Even if it were made with love?
Aww... okay.
I have yet to go.
I'm sorry!
Homework.
Mostly.. I forgot the magazine I was looking at for reference though.. I'll see you around.
Soonish.
Wow, really>. ?*
How so?
And I'll get to see you?. Okay!. I'll try to be quick.
I already know what I. 'm looking for*
Sounds like fun!. I should probably get my cocktail of shots some time soon.
Yes, sorry I missed you!
Snap!. That seems like too much power!. Maybe you should limit yourself?
Double Snap!. Will there be two people against Floryan?. I'll make player two green :P
Green because it references Luigi.. I'm going to Radford now.
You gave me your scuba papers again.. I tried to leave them with you.
I'll do that.
I'm just Peter.
I won't, because it's still in the car :P
I'll get to some much needed work when I get to Radford.. I need to come up with a layout for my magazine.. Like: Front cover, ad, contents, feature, ad, etcetera.
It's Animation themed.. Contents should be easy-- it's just the names of the people who worked on the magazine. Ads are also fairly easy, as they are related to animation-- like how Dragonframe is common for animation, and there's an animation program that recently became open sourced.
You probably can!. I'll think about it (:. I love you too!!!. Are you doing any work on the game right now?
What?
But I'm doing that!!!. Oh :P. Any new items I need to make icons for?
I think I'll make the splash screen for when you beat a level the same size as the store screen.. What do you think of using https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Snack_machine_3538.JPG as reference?
Okay.... Hmm.... This is what I came up with so far.. The spiral is supposed to be a ring that holds the snack items.
Does it look any better?. The numbers won't do anything, they're just there for looks.
Insert means "confirm"
Whichever button you have as the select or main action button will likely be their go to button when trying to select something from the vending machine.
Or enter, one of those.
"a" is usually shoot, but it's also what you select with, while "b" is your secondary button and escapes.. Display what on the screen?
Since you're making it two player, you'll need a way for each player to have their own "ESC"
awsd are direction, and I think z and x are the primary buttons-- for usual key binds.. Are you going to have it so that players can customize the keys they use?
Okay.
I think you just need directional keys, a primary key which selects and swings your net, a secondary key which escapes and throws your power ups, and a key that rotates through your power ups.. Unless you have a key for each available power up.
What if you have a "freeze time" power up?. It stops Floryan, but allows you to save the students.
I guess that's the same idea as the distraction idea.
And it would stop the timer
Oh right.. This isn't the kind of game that you race against the clock.
I love you too!. I'm working on the screens for you.. Smoke bomb
Have you ever opened a bag?. It's a puff of smoke.. I think it's what you're looking for :P
Sleep is for people who are finished with their projects!
Definitely for Leandra's.
But only if she's been properly tucked in.. So... tuck tuck.. There... that should do it.. Store screen sent.. It doesn't have prices though.. There's a red and a blue one.. Good morning!
The highlight frames were the only things I made separate.
That makes sense.. I just wanted to give you something so you could start working.
I sent you the hallway already.. Or what do you mean?
It's called "Classroom and Hallway.png.. "*. Oh. It did appear to be missing. Maybe someone deleted it by mistake?. It's there now.
:P. April the 5th. Is the next available time for an appointment.. At 9.. It's within the 3 week window.. Sorry-- 10:45.. I wanted to see what you thought, but I've just gone ahead and made the appointment.
I think it will be fine.. I don't think there will be one for tomorrow or Wednesday, and I know it doesn't hurt to check, but I think I can spend my time better.
The downtown office does not do passports, and the Radford office won't answer their phones.. What happens when it doesn't?
That doesn't sound like a better alternative.
Okay.. Then I'll do that.
That's okay :P
All alone?. Doesn't sound like fun to me.
I guess I'll drive throw Charlottesville and take you away :P
Neat :P. What do you need now for the game?
:P. I was just imagining them drinking the Ginger Ale.. Did you like the name? I thought "Curall" sounds like a name, but it's also "Cure All"
I'll figure it out.
When would you like the green second player?
Okay.
There is.. I'm not sure how accurate it will be.
Om?
You can't eat it.. I sent it to you. There's three variations total.. What's next?
I can do that.. Done and sent.. Aw man... I meant to give a rotation for the throwing sprites, but now I finished, and I don't want to go back :P
No, for the player.. Player Throw is in.
I got your second player too.
Not so.. I didn't do any diagonal throws though.
What's next?. After level screen?. Multiple classroom layouts?. I finished the store and the restoration from poison, so what now?
Wow!. I didn't know that was me.. Do you want it to be full screen or the same size as the store screen?
What needs to be on it?
Do you think you could draw a wireframe of what you want?. If it doesn't take too long, of course.
That's fine.. I just want to have a clear idea.. It'll take me a "second" to finalize it.
There's a puppy in class!
I know!. Do you think it would make sense to make the splash screen look like a notebook that you're recording your progress in?. Tonight's the night for staying up!
Okay, cool!. I'll make it look like a folder, and on top a piece of notebook paper.. Or just give it spiral rings like a notebook :P
Okay!. Ninja Gaiden kept track of your score as you played, and then at the end added everything up for you.. I might see what the notebook looks like at an angle too.
Yup.. I thought it would make sense to take notes of your progress and achievement in a notebook.. So that's what's happening!
I just need to know what else to include.
What if it was a doodle on the paper that was animating?. animated*
I think when the level is over the player should do a "victory jump"
Or the score and stats for a single player on one page, and the same for the other player if it's needed.. I can do an animation of the page flipping.
To a second page.. How does that sound?
Okay. So tasks... Victory jump, and page turning.. Is that all I need for now?
Yeah, I can do those as soon as you figure them out.. So net range means I need to make a longer net?
I guess I shouldn't have made the nets part of the sprite and just as a layer over it.. It is-- I should probably make it longer.
Just a bit longer? two or three pixels?
I'll determine it.
Maybe one upgrade to make a larger net. I can make a swing down animation.. But maybe save that for later?
Okay, cool!. On the drive now.. They are about as far from the head as I had the back view.. I didn't want to make it look ridiculously long.
You're amazingness!. What else now? Title screen, victory jump, and page turning?
Awesome.. I'll try to make a good turn around after I finish eating.
I do, but it's just three more things?. Do you need an animation of the after game screen? One where the notebook scrolls in from the bottom?
Oh! Okay!
I know what tweening is, I didn't know you had the option. But okay!
Can you make single colors?. I think a transparent black screen should appear behind the notebook.. Can you do that?
I can do it.
I have the notebook ready for whenever you give me the info!. !!!
Okay. So I should go ahead and send the notebook then.. Got it.
That sounds familiar. It might be on Hoth.. But I can't remember.. The black transparency can be used anywhere, since it's just a shape.. And I sent the notebook.. I'll get to the animation.
Okay!
I got you.
Don't remind me!. Puffs and ginger ale sent.. I forgot to make the smoke bomb!. It'll just be orange and it will go on top of the throwing animation (which you should already have). Then I'll make the smoke, which will also be orange.
No problem.
I do.
I've been using layers for a lot of things!
I want to receive and give you all the hugs too!
Microwaves sent.. Hallway sent too.. These are on their own, so you don't have to unpack them (I don't think). But they aren't a uniform size, so I'm not sure about it.
What size does it need to be then?
For the hallway?. Or for everything?
Okay. I can do that-- I didn't know it had to be flush against the border.. Or does it need a pixel on each side?
Awesome!
I lub you too!. Paper Animation sent
Sweet dreams to you too!. I'm just about to send over the store screen and the hallway!
I think when you purchase Da Bomb Cheese Puffs you should receive 10 puffs that you throw.. Ah! Sugar Cubs!
I was thinking the bag isn't a perfect sphere, so I'd have to make rotation sprites.
I didn't make the throw sprite like that, but I suppose I can just have it rotate flat.. Microwaves and hallway officially in.. Smoke variations (I can improve it later if you like) and the rotating cheese puff bag are in.
Ahh! You're so cute!!!. See what happens when he lands? He squashes-- that's an animation technique.. It probably needs another frame though.. If you could use gifs instead of pngs, then you'd already have everything in the right spot :P. Good morning!
(hug). (ignore lol). (I just liked how happy he looks)
That's Jabba the Hutt :P. But I suppose that's an apt description.. Though he's definitely not as cute in person!. Is Classroom Hero (Classroom Heroes?) Still the title of the game?
Makes sense.. I was thinking of the title screen, and maybe you'd have "Singleplayer" and "Multiplayer" a clickable option, but depending on the one you have selected it would show a single jump or a two player jump.
That's what I meant.. It would just highlight.. Title screen would be the name and the jumpers.. That's what I have mocked up so far.. But I was going to make a logo and the 1-player and 2-player buttons.
How would you customize your character?
So I need to make all of the different options?
Yes.. But I was specifically saying that I would need to make each variation in the title screen too.
Just standing sprites?!?!
Such an undynamic stance!
Would you like a Megaman or a Link or a Mario sprite?. They could be unlockables :P
That sounds cool!. What if the Mario mushroom turns you into Mario?. And the Zelda pots turn you into Link?. :P
Makes sense.. Okay. I'll work on a logo and the title screen. I'm not sure what else needs to happen right away.
I'll get onto the coding then.
How many different classmates would you like for me to make?. Anyone I should be referencing?
I'm laying out all of the character sprites so that I can paint over top of them. That way it's a little bit easier.
There would be if if it were all a single image.. But I have multiple layers, so it doesn't work well.. Plus I have to paint new hair and faces anyway.
You sure?. I'm working on the title screen as of now anyway, but you sure?
How does it look so far?. Is that an okay font?
hmmm.... I might need to rethink this design on paper.. I've started to feel under the weather :/
I'm a bit achy and my throat has more gravel than a rural parking lot.
I can't talk, I've lost my voice.. I suppose I can try to talk.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_3XVF_OPfE
You can find anything on the internet!
I got ISFP.. And I've taken the test before :P
Oh no!. Is that bad?
I think I might have.
Wait.. you're the Adventurer? I'm the Harmonizer.. I didn't know that was the result :P
From the one I just took.. It said I was the Harmonizer :P
Oh.. I was confused for a second.
Maybe partially.
What was yours?
Wow.
Spot on.
:P. You're just describing yourself.. Are you reading from your biography?
That's me all right.
:P. They're also creative.. Which was one of the attributes.
Snap!. Got me there.
I guess so :P
It's true.. I think truth is okay, but people are emotionally driven.
Sad2-D2 :(
Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I think I understand my personality score, and I don't think the test is all that accurate for me.
I don't know. I just think there are too many variables.. And I've got much to do, but I think my body will fail me if I don't sleep :P. I will sleep, unfortunately I needed a magazine nearly completed, and I do not have one.
I love you too!. Scott's number is 540-557-7621
Me too :P
Wow!. They won't be impervious to your hugs anymore!. How'd it get in the building???
Dun dun!
No.... It's a real horse :P
I'm going to try to put this guys work in my magazine: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJx7XNG-m296QV9qX5HEFtQ
Have fun.
I need to think about what I'm going to email him :P
No, but I still need to request permission to use any of his imagery.
Hello Mr. Lafferty,  My name is Peter Mattox. I'm currently in a publications class and I am working on an unofficial Traditional Animation Magazine for the class. The reason I am contacting you today is because I would like to feature you in the magazine and use some of your imagery.. I've never asked someone to do this before, so I'm not sure what I should put.
Technically I'm publishing it for the class.. And he may be willing to send higher quality images to me, which would be better than what I would rip from youtube.
How does this sound: My name is Peter Mattox. I'm currently in a publications class and I am working on an unofficial Traditional Animation Magazine for the class. I really enjoy the work you've done with Curse of the Wolf's Heart, I think it's a great example of the work process of an animator and the process of stop motion animation. I am requesting permission to use your images in the magazine. The magazine will provide the history of animation, basic principals of animation, tutorials for people who wish to get into animation, and features on animators, all of which can help inspire potential animators.. I think I'm going to contact James Lopez as well.
:P. Yup. My name is getting all over the place.. James Lopez gave permission!. Kind of a big deal :P
He worked on Hercules as the lead animator.. He was a Disney animator.. So it's pretty cool.
Jeff Lafferty has yet to respond, but that's probably because I mailed him through youtube, and I should have just emailed him directly :P. Just two more animators and I should probably be set for the features.
I'm slowly deteriorating.. How are you feeling?
Sounds eventful!. My mind is hazy and I can't focus.. It's not good.. I shouldn't really complain, but I think it affected the art I was making today.. I can't go to Bitcamp this year. I have my BFA Senior Review on the 8th.
Could help me?
Oh, it wouldn't help with my sickness.. I also already ate it.. Jeff Lafferty responded and offered higher res photos too.. So I just gotta think about what I need.. Would you be interested in going to my Senior Show?. It's April 15th.
Let me find out!. It's likely 7pm, but I don't have a definitive time on my calendar.. Though it may be 5 or 6pm, as I think those are more reasonable times.
It's the Senior Graphic Design show, so it's a show case of everyones (inluding my) work.. I wish I had some soup :P
That would be impressive!
Oh yeah, probalby.. probably*. :P. I think I'm going to sleep early today.. Sweet dreams to you!
What about the soup? I don't have any :P
That's so nice of you.
Om nom.
I can wait for soup :P. !!
It's tough choosing between miso and hot and sour.
Both?. Are you crazy??
That all sounds amazing.
I think you can surprise me! I don't want more than you're willing to offer.
Shrimp is probably safer.. Scallops are clams?. Won't that just make me feel clammy :P
Either sounds fine.
That's the one.
Can I use my card? Or is it a cash business?
I do.
1311 is the last 4 digits.. pmattox2@radford.edu (I'm pretty sure)
on CC
6877
I'm not sure.
That sounds good.
$2 what I was thinking too.
I just made tea too!
Thank you so much!
Yes, thank you!. I didn't finish it all though :P. The miso soup had seaweed in it.
(hug). I love you!
Oh definitely!. Did you have a movie night?
om nom@. Good morning sleepy panda!
That's you!. Good morning!
I'm still under the weather.. How are you feeling today?. My portfolio site is down, which is sad :P. How's the game coming along?. Never mind, the site wasn't opening on campus-- it's working at home just fine.
Awesome!. Proud of you!. (hug). I love you!. Thanks so much for the food last night! (:
I think the sickness is waning, but I may not feel 100% until Saturday (I'm thinking tomorrow I'll be 78%)
That's me!. Need any sprites done?
It wouldn't be too much work, but when would you need that by?
Okay, cool!
I will rest.. I thought about helping more, but my body says no.. I just fried the leftover rice with an egg and om nom.
Gotta om nom to get better.. OM!. It's pretty good :P. How does the game look?
Hopefully!
Am I a team member? :P
Awesome!. That's all I needed :P. I hope they contribute soon!. I want to show the game off at my senior show :P
Oh no!. My phone is upstairs!
Let me get up there!. You can call back if you like, I'm still pretty hard to listen to.. I understand if you're busy though.
Wow!!!11113223#2$@1. How I feel.... vs. how exciting that is!. I'm finding it very difficult to draw Toto.
Good morning!. Hello!
How are you today?
Just okay?. What's up?. Buttercup?. I'm okay too.. I love you!. And I lub you :3
I hope you're doing better!. I can't wait to see you again!. (hug)
What was wrong before?. I'm slowly recuperating.. I grayed out the ginger ale and the cheese puffs for you.. Wow.. a new to do list?. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I can make those hearts you needed.. Wow.. Just a barrage of messages from my end! That must get troublesome.
Yeah-- if that's what you meant for the icons. I just put a filter over it :P. I skimmed the todo, do you need me to read the whole thing?. I'm researching for Japan.
Good morning.. I would like to help you with the bookings.
Sure!. I can make the time for you!
All day :P
Okay..! :P
Sounds good to me!
Awesome!!!. I'm feeling better!. 90%. Do you need help?
Okay (:. I'll be ready whenever you need me then!
Ready for what?
Oh, okay!
I'm just lounging about :P
I'm on :P
I love you toooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111!!!1!
I didn't have a sugar cub variant of my own :(. I can see you type!. :3
It's true.. True to life :P
It's difficult to get to a composition that I'm happy with.
You don't know what they look like!. In my dream last night I was a mermaid.. But I could temporarily grow legs when I went on land.
But it wasn't a curse!. Just something I could do naturally.
It was only temporary, but I wasn't evil, I just liked going on land.. I went on land with my brothers and we took after school lessons.
(I had multiple brothers, all of whom where not my actual brother)
I guess I merman :P. People discovered my powers and tried to capture me.. But I got away.
And I swam back home.
I had to be more inconspicuous, but things weren't over for me just yet!
So I wasn't confined to the ocean, but I wasn't so victorious.
Well... only intense battles under the sea!
When I returned I found that my home had been over run by a competing tribe!
I have noticed a few games that share currency, but have their own inventory.. I think I'd prefer my own though.
Or a "How could you use all of the items?"
Like-- arguments would ensue, because someone would use all of the items.
Yeah, you have to feed them the antidote!. And I suppose that cooperation is key :P
:P
Soup so good!!!
I didn't realize the panda was in the soup :o. I thought he was eating the soup!
I made a mistake!
Outside of the panda fur.. :P
Still figuring out characters.. I can't wait either!
!!!. Fun with foxes!
Fun with Leandra!!
:3
Not super pleased with what I have, but that's okay.
Did you see what I sent you?
Yes. I can resend it.
:3. You're just saying that!. I'm still finding trouble with Dorothy and Toto-- but I think I'll stick with this one.. The power keeps going out. I should probably go to sleep :P
Power's back!
Congrats aren't in order. It just means I can talk to you.
Mhmm!. I sent you a second preview of my illustrations. What did you think?
That's the one :P
I just sent you the munchkin version.. I keep making small mistakes, so I hope you don't notice.. I'm not sure whether or not to illustrate the wicked witch or just her castle.. Need more help planning?. Of course you do!. But I'm ready when you are :P
I hope so!
I'm having trouble picking imagery!. Like for the Journey to the Great Oz I was thinking the group would be in a camp, but now I think they should be walking, because that would make the most sense for "Journey"
:P. Yeah, that's okay.. Decisions are hard regardless though!. And I'm running out of paper to make roughs on! :o
!! I still have your feet measurements!!!!. I can make you shoes too :D. It's been my dream for years!!!!. Moccasins have simple patterns.
That doesn't sound hard!. They have leather at Jo Ann's!. It's about the size of your foot :P
There's suede too :P. But suede is slippery.. The leather should work.. And two pieces would only be about $11.
The leather should be more durable, and you'll still feel anything underneath.
I can make you something too!. You can trust me!
Have fun!
I love you too!
Nope.. Do you mind me calling you adorable?
I always do!. I've sent you more progress.. I'm about halfway done.
I'm not sure if you're getting it or not.. I hope office hours were nice.. I made some soup.. It was the canned kind, so not really "made by me" but I added veggies and whatnot.
Late for soup?. That's okay. That just means you can't have any.. But more can be made, if you would like some!
Deadline not met, but I'm getting there.. I'm sending you my illustrations as I go though. So I hope you're fairly caught up.
Not the recent bunch :P
It's scarecrows face D;
It's okay, they're going to be rescued!
Indeed!. I have 11 images left to draw, but I can help with more Japan planning.. "Japlanning" if you will.
Okay.. We can do it over food again :P
Okay!. I'm slightly concerned about my magazine, but I'll try and work on that after my illustrations.
Just 24.. And my magazine is technically due tomorrow.
We gotta get planning done as soon as possible!. The final magazine isn't due until much later.
I got food already.. I'm ready for ya.
Already there and ready.
I didn't realize you were leaving.
Ahh
Sorry :/. I don't know what I want to see until we research it.
And did you not hear the enthusiasm for Shirakawa-go and the prayer houses?. I learned that from the Japanese heritage quizzes.
Not on the planning list, otherwise I would have seen it.
Yes.
Goodnight!. You sure got quite the amount of winky faces from James.
Still here!. I love you too!. 7 illustrations left and I'm so behind!
That takes so long and still likely isn't enough time!!
Good morning!. My flying monkeys look so goofy! :(
:P
I love you too!. Almost forgot the colophon!. All 24 illustrations are done (each with varying degrees of satisfaction) and I just need a cover now.
You're amazing!. Not sure what to do about the book cover!
I have failed you!. I'm so sorry :(
Or was it I who wasn't smart enough??
:3. What are you up to now?. What's the eta for the game?
Cool!. I need to select what I'm going to show in the senior show.. I was hoping the game could be something!
That would be super cool!. I can't use my tablet because all of my micro usbs have plastic shells that are too big  to fit :P
I know!. I really needed it too.
I'm sure it's bad advice coming from a good place!. This is my cover so far.
Sweet dreams, my one and only.
Sleep well!!. Tuck tuck!. I'm playing with the blue color
What kind of blue would you like?
One last blue!
Oh no! I over slept and my appointment is at 10:45 :(. I don't have my picture ready! :?
They didn't accept my photo anyway because of the shadows :P. 6 weeks to wait :P
They did.. I made sure to dress nicely (though with bed head) just in case.. This is the cover I went with.
You like it?. You really like it!!. I didn't click you, lumpy purple thing!
Have fun!. Be safe (:. What's my deadline for fixing those sprites?
Alpha by tomorrow though?. I'll see what I can do.. I have my magazine to work on and I need to pick out what I want to put in the show. Deadline was yesterday, but I honestly don't know what to include.
Yep.. Gotta pick :P
Those don't count, unfortunately.
Okay! I fixed them!. The addition of the "floating" folder should make you happy.. Or I hope it does at least.
I didn't know what to name them (I had to do it manually) I just named them in the order their supposed to be.
they're*. I'm sorry!
I was about to do the same thing for the poison bubbles.. So feel free to let me know how that's supposed to be.
Okay!
Poison bubble 01?. bubbles added!. Do you think you could give me a few suggestions on what to include in my senior show?. Also-- do you want me to make that clock for you?
For a timer :P
I can include physical copies, or pictures.
Those drawings aren't enough to warrant a show :P
Have fun. I love you. I didn't realize I was dying or that you were threatening me :P
I love you too!. The suspense after "about that...". What do you have to tell me? Is it terminal?. Oh no. I said I love you one too many times!. Goodnight, I hope you sleep well.. If there's anything else you need from me... like a title screen, or extra characters (extra playable characters), a few sprites that didn't unpack properly, hugs, more power up items,  or anything at all, let me know!
And scene.
When you're dramatic, you're dramatic.. I can't help that it's the only one to accurately describe me.. I guess there's this cactus.. Sweet dreams to you too!. I hope the revised sprites help.
Awesome!!!
You too!. Tuck tuck.
Good morning!
I have watercolor class and publications class today. I have my magazine to work on, and I still have pieces to include in the show (and what to include in my exit review)
It's a lot!. I'm a bit worried about it.
I suppose what I have up on the website. I have my packaging that I can submit, and my illustrations from Illustration class.. I can include my Wizard of Oz book, my magazine (though I doubt it will be finished), my Wizard of Oz stop motion puppets (again, I doubt they will be finished), and old projects.. Animations can also be included I think.
I forgot about jewelry!. I don't have any of the jewelry that I made you :P. I don't think the Pooh bear characters reflect the level of detail and finish that I want to portray at the show.. Is today alpha day?. Do you need a logo?
But I need to put it up a few days in advance.. So you'd be a bit late :P. How does this look?
Wow!. You think so?. I need to decide on what to include in my portfolio :(. I think you should have a "Choose your Hero" screen, so that you don't do it all on the start screen.
I think it would be easier for me if there were a "choose your hero" screen :P
Okay.
Easier for me to make.
I was just thinking that if multiple characters were to exist, then choosing them on a separate screen would be easier, because it's something that can be added later.
I don't believe that's something you're going to want to keep hidden :P
Oh, then that changes my title screen altogether :P
Okay!. I sent you the title screen. It can be temporary.
Friday is my review, after that I should be less busy.. I can definitely make time for you.
Whoa, what do you mean???. How will you see my face?
Then you can have my face!. That's not hard.. I thought you were going to see me in person somehow.. And I got excited :P
The review is Friday at 11:30 and should only last until 11:45.. So I could visit :p. (If you thought that that would be cool). Of course I think it'd be cool, but I suppose I would have to find a place to stay for the night unless I were to leave as soon as I got there :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
You disappeared on me :P
Pretty exciting!. Hello!
Sorry! Too many programs running at one time!!
Sorry :/. The morning won't work for me, unfortunately.
Good morning!. Zzzz
Wow! It's totally me too!
I don't want to leave :(. We just started to trust each other.
Eep!. You got me!. My portfolio isn't finished, but I'm going to print it.. I unfortunately no longer have the flatbook to present it in.. I opted to return it and purchase a nicer one online, but you know how that can be :P
A few points off (or a lot, I'm not sure) but it'll be better than nothing.. I think I know what I'm printing for tomorrows exit review, so that's good.. I gotta blast!. (Gotta print things before class starts.)
Thank you!. Did you want me to visit tomorrow night?
Oh.. I see.. That's understandable.
I thought someone lived in there!. It's up to you (:
Oh-- I thought it wasn't up to you until next year :P
Okay!. Good luck!
What does that mean? It reduces to 2/5!
Oh man!. 6 of those people gotta step up.. Or not-- because intruding isn't something that should be welcomed easily.
Neat :P
I do want to go!. That's where we're going!
:P. Become the monkey you were born to be.
Never.. I'll look at it later though!. I'm running around today.
Wow!
You won't believe what she can do with her shoulder.
Well I'm a graphic designer.. It's in my job description to get people to click bait :P. But baiting with good designs.. And interesting products.. Hello!. Or not :P
I hope your day is going well!
It's tomorrow :P
I got 3/5 points-- so it could have been worse.
Yep-- fortunately it's not the final, which is worth more points.. Anything you want to say? My laptop is fading gray.
Wow! Passing grade!!!. I love you too :3. I'll let you get back to your day. I gotta grab fancy clothes from my Blacksburg house, and then I'm back to Radford!. Tah tah for now, Cutie Pie!
It's required! :P. It's a professional event.
Time to head to Radford!. I'll take the Buick-- that way I can go straight to Charlottesville if you receive permission!
Yep!. Pretty cool!. (hug). Hello!. I'm just hanging out working on this portfolio o' mine.. It's nearly "finished". (Finished to a point where I think I can start working on other pressing matters). What are the names of your partners for Classroom Heroes?. I want to attribute them for the show.
Is that the order you want to appear?
To Japan?
Or to Charlottesville?. I don't have one!. Just the pink and white one.. What do I need it for?
I have no guns!. I don't like showing off my arms :P
Yes.. Also because I don't have a tank top.
Not in Radford.
D:
Okay, don't you worry.. Popcorn will be coming.. And it'll be popping sooner than you think!
Thanks! (:. I'm glad they're working!
Ahhh!. I don't have an artist statement prepared for tomorrow :P
It needs to be 150-200 words.. So fairly short.
Probably :P
Okay!
Do you think you could look over my artist statement?. It's regrettably, not very good (also too long), but I have some stuff right now.
There's probably a more elegant way of wording things, and a way to include "traditional influences" that my sleep deprived mind cannot comprehend at this hour.. All I can do is cut and fold paper :p
Of course-- those are all three areas I was trying to fix :P
I'm a very passive person :P
My teacher didn't want us using the word "I"
I know-- I tried to limit it though.
Oh I am :P
Shucks :P
:P
My review is at 11:30, so I'll try to work on it now.
Leant was a typo that spellcheck didn't pick up because it's technically a word.
Thank you. I had no idea it was that bad.. I suppose I had some inkling.
What did you do there? Did you purposefully make it distracting?
No idea.
Thanks.
You're great.. I had no voice :P
It's pretty concise.
I see. I still have to cut it down by 60 or so words. Thanks so much though!. Don't worry any more, you can go ahead and sleep-- sorry to keep you up for so long.
How does one write more concisely?
Thanks so much!
Oh..
Oops!. No-- go ahead and sleep!
Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I love you!. I gotta wake up at 7 or 7:30!. Let's see if I can do it!
Will do!. Just finished!. They really liked my work (:
Now I can head home, pack and drive over.. I won't forget the popcorn.
Senior show here we come!
I just gotta finish those puppets and a book.. Talk to you when I get back to the internet!. Back to the internet!
Om nom!. Give me a second to pack and I'll be on my way!. Do I need to bring anything? Shorts? Sneakers?. I don't know what the weather is like :P
You got it.. I already had that packed.. I might be able to go now :P
I have oil in the car, and the tank is close to full-- should be okay, and if not, there are plenty of gas stations.. Just need to grab toiletries.. Which were in a convenient baggie.. I hope I'm not forgetting anything?. Could you run through what I "might" need?
Some of my homework involves painting, cutting things, and making stop motion puppets-- I think I'll leave those here.. I'll work on the magazine while I'm there.. I was going to offer to take you shopping if you didn't :P. No tank top, sorry-- it's in Blacksburg.. Okay... I think I have everything.. I'll head out now.. No food to bring though!. Leaving now!
Got it.. See you soon.
Hello!
Hi hi!. How are you?
That's good!. I'm om nomming bread :P. How's the game coming along?. Or any other projects? (:
Wow! You'll be able to mine Runite in no time!. (hug. )*. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you.. I hope I didn't leave my pencil in the study room :P
My puppets aren't ready!. I'd assume the study room, but it might not be very likely.. I'm not actually eating a donut :P. Hello!
How are you?
I'm also good!. Just getting projects together.
Oh no!!!!!!1. How'd that happen?
Don't die!
I hope not!
That's good!
Sometimes :P. Like every day when I eat gmos :P
I was just kidding-- technically everything is genetically modified :P
It definitely depends on what was modified and whether or not it was an improvement!
Have you seen dog breeds?
I guess we'll see the affects the food has on us.
You have a point :P
Test tube meat sounds neat :P
Soon we won't need to eat!. Food will just appear in our stomachs.
Yeah, I wouldn't want to give it up, but it takes up so much time!
om nom
That's why food is fast now.. Because of how inconvenient it is.
What about speed eating?
:P. I suppose when people are really crunched for time they just skip eating.
It would though, because you can't eat and cut paper at the same time.
But you take time out to take a bite, and you have to wash your hands after each bite, because you get your hands messy.
If I were to eat a pb & j for example, peanut butter and jelly are sticky, and it's a finger food.. And it's very easy to get your hands messy.
:P. I'm not cutting paper, I was just proposing a theoretical scenario.. You can't eat and do anything craft related.
I like the taste of food-- so in the future it will just be an optional activity for the rich.
What are you interested in. Aren't there other things you want?
Also-- I think Floryan is supposed to be bigger.. There are plenty of things to touch on!. Florying walking, multiple students, etc.
Makes sense!. And the longer net!
And how should I indicate the amount?
But hearts will be multiple hearts?
Got it. I'll see what I can do.
Anything won't be what I give you. :P. So hearts, vp, ginger ale, and bomb icons-- do you want "Player 1" and "Player 2" stick figures?. player 2 would just have their info on the other side of the whiteboard.. When do you need this by?
You sure?
It's not supposed to be better resolution-- it's supposed to be the same pixel dimensions as the rest of the game.
It creates a harmonious design that isn't cluttered with varying pixel weight!. It makes everything standardized :P. You can do what you want of course, because you're the game designer :P. I do recommend a pixel based font though.. I can send it to you as soon as I get the chance.
The pressure is building, but I'm hanging in there.. Wait... weird monkeys..
I'm worried I won't have my puppets done for the show.. I suppose I could always cut a few corners to make them.
It'll pain me :P. But it must be done.. I want to keep helping with Japan bookings.. I think peanut butter swirl would be a good ice cream flavor (It would be plain vanilla with peanut butter swirled in). nom :P. Good morning!. I love you!
(:. Did you want a larger clock?
But it'd be more detailed!. I'm going to resend the classroom, the markers got in the way of the icons on the white board.
Okay, let me know.. Time for watercolor class!
I'll try!. Thank you.. I hope you have a wonderful day!
Do you want me to give you numbers?. Like-- would you like for me to make the font for you?
Okay!. Check the drive.. I uploaded the things.. Let me know what else I can do for you.
No problem!. I gave you numbers and a variety of "Player" sizes.. Just in case-- if it's difficult to use, don't use it.. I also removed the clock and the markers from the whiteboard.. (from the background*). This way you can move anything anywhere.. Or have a bigger clock.
You have to look at it with the eye.
They're scaled up to 200% like everything else.
Oh snap!. What is the black bar?
What are those for?
Oh, right... right. :P
I thought they were supposed to be transparencies.. Wait! They go behind!. I put "Title Screen 1 or 2" and it has both player one and 2 on a transparent background.. Player 1 bar and Player 2 bar go behind them (They're the same size, but they are placed where they need to be on the screen). So it's supposed to be that black.
No problem!
I'll use it as background audio!
You're my favorite!
That's good!. I didn't realize that I needed them, but I should have picked up some of those command strips.. My show is at 5pm. It's okay if you can't make it though!
I'm not sure-- any kind I suppose. I need it sooner than you can get it to me, so don't worry about it.. Need anything else for the game?. Has the zinc helped?
You're supposed to eat it before for a healthy immune system!
Interesting!
I thought you just ate a bunch of candy to prevent sickness :P
Does it though?. Probably...
Yeah, you're just good!. The sickness was probably to scared of you.. too*. two?
Don't miss out!!!!!@111121@@!@!. GOGOGOGOGOGOGOG
Eat all of the custard!
Friday is my show :P
No class :P. Are you suggesting I come Thursday?
Maybe you should buy all the 5 cent custard and freeze it and bring it Friday :P
That figures.
Wow custard party with them?. Go to both locations!. or don't :P. Wait... what's real?. Battle Bots?
I've seen battle bots :P
Whoa!. Join!. Or go to one of the events and see robo-carnage!. How's the game coming?. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. How's Text Mining?
Awesome!
Cool, cool!. I love you!
(hug). 99 luftballons!
What?. How does that happen??
I think it's more likely that you thought you woke up so you were trying to change into morning clothes, but as soon as the shorts came off, you had nothing to change into, so for the rest of the night you kept trying to wear your bed sheets.
Just call me Holmes...
Whoa.... WHOA!. Time to call Disney... they need to hear this.. Beauty and the Beast and Science!. (I'll come up with a better name later)
That sounds awesome!. I hope you're day is great!
Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Nap time!. Good morning!
It's until 7pm!
I've had everything that can go wrong do so today.
The bondurant art gallery downtown next to Crumb and Get it.. 1129 E Main St, Radford, VA 24141
Thanks!. I'll save you a plate of reception food!
I'm sorry for not doing so!. The food went fast!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
!!!
What kind of sandwhich would you like?. Just peanut butter?. Or with honey or banana?
:3. I can melt some chocolate on the sandwich if that's what you want!
On the sandwich?. Okay!. It'll be an us sandwich.
Oh no! I over slept :(
Oh wow!. I didn't realize now was the moment.. Is now a good time to come over?
Okay :/. I'll get airbnb's together then.
Okay. I will too.
Do you want me to stop then?
:/. I'll just go in a corner and feel awful then.
With the amount of time you want to see me, I'm surprised you even want me to go on the trip anymore.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11462293?checkin=05%2F22%2F2016&checkout=05%2F25%2F2016&guests=2&s=u2cYKULK
Sorry-- I don't think it's on the island.. Just next to it.. Oh-- but I'm also not finding any places on the island-- so we would have to stay in Hiroshima and have a day trip to it.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11620915?checkin=05%2F22%2F2016&checkout=05%2F25%2F2016&guests=2&s=u2cYKULK. This one has fairly detailed information about the nearby stations and the amount of time it takes to go to Hiroshima and to Miyajima.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11447736?checkin=05%2F25%2F2016&checkout=05%2F28%2F2016&guests=2&s=a5O2utyX Takayama doesn't have a lot of private homes available.. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. I really wanted to, but you don't trust me to.
It's listed in the description (for the Wood Home in Hiroshima)
It takes about 10 minutes by ferry to travel from Miyajimaguchi pier to the world cultural heritage site of Miyajima. And there's a time table for the ferry too: http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jr-miyajimaferry.co.jp%2Ftime%2F&act=url. And people suggested it's a 3 minute walk from the Miyajimaguchi Station to the pier.. So about 53 minutes to travel.
There's a shorter walk to the bus station, and it takes 30 minutes to get to Miyajima.. But I don't mind 20 minutes of walking.
The cost per kilometer is around 20 yen for short distances, and decreases to under 10 yen for long distances.. There's a lot that goes into a ticket :P. That's just the base fare.
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6890168?checkin=05%2F25%2F2016&checkout=05%2F28%2F2016&guests=2&s=a5O2utyX. Shirahama beach for Izu Peninsula?
That's not a beach on Izu Peninsula?
Have fun at the festival.. Shirahama Beach is near Wakayama.
I can't find Shirahama beach on Izu Peninsula-- only Wakayama.
But I suppose there are two.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6317808?checkin=05%2F28%2F2016&checkout=05%2F30%2F2016&guests=2&s=hHH6g1ND. It's a private room, the only private house I saw was on the border of the peninsula.. By that I mean-- it wasn't on the peninsula.. The dates for Ryogoku sumo stadium are no longer available.. The 11th and 14th are booked.
Would you like for me to instant book?
Should I send you what I write to the host before I confirm?
I don't think it will be.
Something like this: Hello Sao. We are two students traveling Japan for the summer. We are very interested in Japanese culture, and we believe your home would be a great place to stay while we experience Hiroshima. We like the easy travel from your home to Miyajima and to the Atomic Bomb Museum.
(I haven't signed off yet)
We are quiet and respectful guests and  we will treat your home as we would our own.
I believe so.
Are you okay with the Tokyo stay having a strict check in?
Just that Nobu has very strict check in/check out times.. He won't allow for early/late check in.
Yes, the one by Sumo Stadium.
I doubt you looked at any of them!. It's pretty much the same message, but I replaces the host and the location-- as well as the sites there (There may be more you want to include!) The airbnb in Takayama is the only one without pocket wifi-- which is nice.. replaced*. The total cost is $914. I haven't yet made the bookings. Do I instabook or something else?
Should I mention that I'm traveling with you in particular?. The planning sheet on google doc?
I don't see a budget. You said that there was a $1500 cap though...
What folder?
You shared "Planning" with me.. A google doc, you didn't share a folder.
Excuse me?
Okay-- I have it.
The budget is lower than these prices.. Did you not account for a service fee?. Okay-- the total from the current bookings is $914, what you have in the folder is $933, so it will be less (this does not include Izu or when we are back in Tokyo). It appears to be within budget, so should I instant book?
When those are 0 it's $933, with them it's $1,133.00
I meant that they were not in the price I gave you.. So good to book?
Oh those are important.
Okay.. the spreadsheet was in preview, because I hadn't added it to my drive (silly me) But I was able to add the new prices.
Oh-- and you should have received the itinerary. When do you want to work on the game?
Okay!. I hope those sandwiches serve you well!. I'm happy that you get to eat them!!. I slaved for so long on them :P
Oh dear!. That's good you had food!!. (:
Oh no1. !*
Maybe I should have gotten the cheaper ones for me, and the cheaper ones for you :P
You had $147 for Tokyo, and I had like $112
I see.... Maybe you should have ordered them :P. But maybe you get a discount for all the trips you've been on?
Perhaps... At least we have them?
Work time!. What do you need from me?
What do they look like?
Hmmm... okay!. I have everything in separate layers, so I can always move things around.. You also need a moving Floryan?. Okay.. so pictures tomorrow... What do you need tonight?
Right. If the levels can wait until tomorrow, then I can get them together.. The timer can be a wall clock.. I can make it larger.. And we can think of the end game screen together!
I would make it more detailed-- or it can be a digital clock.
:P. That sounds silly :p. By that I mean-- it needs to be as complicated and detailed as possible!
Of course!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I want to get something together for you, but I'm not certain what to make yet.
Okay/. I might just use a different carpet.
I know how to find and replace.
I don't know who the boss characters are.
So should the bosses be the same size?
Photoshop won't parse the file you gave me.
I have no idea-- it just won't open the file.
Can you send it via google drive?
The comic version?
I don't know what the real Weimer looks like.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I'll help you more tomorrow.
I love you.
Sleep tight!. Tuck tuck tuck
Good morning~. Have a great day today!. I love you!
Send me pictures of classrooms as you get them, please!
Sooo...?. What do you think?
I see...
I've seen.. I'd probably just make them brown.. What does Weimer's classroom look like?
There's one of those in Floryan's classroom too?. I can make one and you can place it where you need it.
The desks look gray.
I see.... Well I can make new tables!
Awesome.
:P. That was a lot of reading-- does that show respect by reading the whole thing?. Since it took time?
That makes sense-- considering he said that he's not a fan :P
Yeah-- that's what he said he's not a fan of.. When is my deadline for backgrounds, bosses, and???
Okay.. so later today?. I'll see what I can do!. I was going to get my watercolors out of the way so that I can focus on other classes.. I have another painting to do as well, but I can do that tomorrow.
backdrop for controls?. So confused :P
So would that be the informational screen?
instructional*
Couldn't you put the controls on the same screen?
Okay. Are there wire frames of what you want?. Find and replace color isn't doing a good job :P
It was able to change the color of the shirt and the hair, but not the skin.. I can do that manually.. Okay. I'll work on it when I get home tonight.. After a few watercolor paintings.
Don't you worry about it, I'll get things to you!. Oh, and I was going to do that too!
Wow! Cool!
In the game?. It looks fine to me.
Oh no-- is that an issue?. Do you need a larger image?. Should I give other characters longer hair?
I do.. I have everything I've sent you :P
The player would enter the left and exit the right.. The way the classroom is set up at least.. That's*
But the classroom is also on the left?. Facebook is saying "Show previous messages" and it will not, did you say something else?
But that doesn't make sense.. You exit from the right so the shadow is on the right.
In the classroom you have the entrance on the left and the exit on the right, the hallway takes you out to that exit.. So you're further right than you were before.. I suppose you're passed the vending machines though-- regardless, I sent you the one with the shadow on the left.
I get it!
I looked up my passport progress and it says I'm not in the system.
These are dark times.
Dark times indeed.. Do you like your phone? --and do you think I should get one like it?. I know you did a fair amount of research into it beforehand, so you probably really like it.
I think Gap has a similar phone, and I think he's happy with it as well.. I'll consider it!. Maybe one slightly different so I can tell the difference.
What's wrong with beveled edges?
That looks so silly.
Yeah-- I'm a flat screen kind of guy.. Oh-- so do you need a larger title screen?
*tackled*
Oh. Okay!
Is that good?
Cool!. Now you need every angle?. I gotcha!
Right.. right!
It has issues. It won't replace to an exact color.
Oh-- go ahead and do that, but I suppose you need the longer net first.
Longer side net coming your way!!
I know :P. If this doesn't work then I'm not sure how to make it much longer!. I've got one trick left, but I'm hoping I won't need to use it o.o
Cool.. Let me know!. Would you have wanted all of the sprites all together?
Well... I sent just the left and right facing swing sprites.
They should be.
Going to bed early?. Goodnight and sweet dreams to you!. You never gave me classrooms to work off of!. Good morning!
Since always?. Can't get work done that early :P
You heard me :P. I'm just teasing, of course :P. There's a sprite flipped the wrong direction in the student spritesheet you sent me.
Oh no!. It was my fault!. I've fixed the problem-- I'll send it to you when I send all of them.
The chairs were flipped to where the highlight was on the wrong side.
Nope, I just reflected it to where it needed to be.. I was smiling in one of the BFA show pictures, but only one of the pictures was given to me.
It's the only one I have!
:P. There's only two more :P. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUTbvXJg_P0. Thanks!
I think the last one is a good indicator of the room.. I skimmed to see parts.
Thanks!. I've got this here magazine to complete!. It's fairly time sensitive, but I understand your game needs to be in beta for tomorrow!. What is my deadline//when do you need it by?
It's not hard to make the classrooms-- it's just a little bit of moving assets here and there.. It won't be very time consuming, but I want to make more headway with my magazine before I work on something else.
I am happy to help afterwards though!. You can compile a list of tasks you want me to do (:
(I already have a list, but you can add to it)
Cody lives in Ohio.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
(hug). I love you!. I'm sending you the boss fronts.. Meant to send you this, not the psd file.. Not sure about the boss likenesses, but you can use them temporarily.. Never got a check list from you, but I'll try to get things done for you-- when do you need the beta to be ready?. And will there be more time to work on the game?. I was going to keep working, but I've gotten a headache-- which is rare for me. I think I'm going to sleep it off!
You're welcome!. What else do you need?!
I have class at 1, but it's watercolor, so I would be available to work on things. Still chugging along on this magazine.
Thanks. I'm just working on things other than watercolor.
I'm willing to help you if you need it right away!
I don't know who Nick is, but it's the one with the two guys that look alike.
I got you!
Wow!. Can I give you a gif or do you need the animation?
The paper animation should be the same! I can't see why it would be different.. I just sent you the arrow.
Okay, I'll get to the smokebomb.
Thank you!
What??. There are pixel gaps!. 2 of em.. Bag and smoke are up.
Would you like me to send the individual tables?
No problem!. Tables sent.. All 8, because I won't skimp you :P
Let me know of anything else that's urgent!
Not a problem (:. I love you!. ]. Don't forget about dollar subs from Jimmy Johns tomorrow!
I can help!. I was busy cooking, which is why I didn't respond!. My laptop was also being unresponsive when I was trying to log in, so I restarted it!. What are you looking for? I can make it!. What did your imagination make that your hands could not?. "My goal whenever I create A design or an illustration is to see that each detail tells a story, even if the details go unnoticed. ". Does that sound like a good quote?
I can do it super quick!. Put me in coach!. Sorry I didn't get more backgrounds to you.. Do you need to make more revisions after the beta?
What does that mean? Do you want a separate door?
I'm confused. You want the hallway floor to go behind the door?
Okay-- I took care of it.. I gave you the door in a separate file too-- that way you can use it.. separate png*
But I made it the size of the door.. Sent.. Don't worry about anything!
It doesn't take very long to redo.
Classroom 1 and 3 sent to you.. 3 was just a brown overlay over the carpet and a chalk board.. Classroom 1 just has the door added.. Did you want that background from before?
Oh. I was leaving room for your own timer.. I just added the clock back.. On both. Use them how you like.. What about the instruction background?. What were you hoping for?
Cool!. I can keep helping so that you can finish sooner-- or add more later :P
Any time!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I love you so much (:
Coolio.. Sleep tight.
Of course!. I would have said yes last night, but I got sleepy :P
Wow!
Still downloading.
It's just opening a white screen.
That would explain it.. That music is catchy.. I can't move!
I could never move.. Everything else moved though.. The end game screen ends before the victory spin is over-- also I think the spin could go faster!
No-- that spin the character does when they win.
I used awsd and the arrow keys.. I can't get past the end level screen either.. Who made the music?
Was it free use?
Also.. Floryan is too small.. He was supposed to be larger and more imposing and his pixels were supposed to be the same size as everything else was.
What size is it? It bothers me that the pixels are different sizes.
Okay.. I can fix that.
He'll be less detailed, of course.. Can you make a version at 1 to 1?
But I made sure there would be room!
You too!. I would like to test it more, but you know :P. Oh-- You've got a bit of carpet showing on the hallway :P
I pressed "b". I was still not able to move though.. Also-- when the character walks he has two walking images and one standing-- I feel like maybe you're animating all three at once?
Yeah-- it's my fault.. That middle one is him standing still-- so if there were ever a pause or if the player stopped moving it would go to that one.. The other two are the walking sprites that go back and forth.. Time for class!. That's definitely my fault though.. Player two can move.. Player one could not.. I could not throw the bombs-- or at least there wasn't a smoke animation with it.. And Floryan has a super large hitbox.. Whenever the player stops moving it stays on one of the walking images.. That's whenever he is facing left or right.. I think you're using 1, 2, and 3 as the keybinding for the items and the net. I've found that to be awkward for my fingers.. I think using z, x, and c might help-- or using q and e
Primary could be q and secondary could be e.. Two hands?. Oh..
That's tough with two people sharing the keyboard.
That might be nice.
Is that hard?
I can make anything you want.
Just give me a list.
When is the final due?
Make everything done next week, then final touches until May 3rd.
:P. Beta Part II. I think the instruction screen could be the hallway with the student standing toward the bottom.. Oh-- the net looks pretty good now! send me the sprite sheet so I can make the shirts green.. Student walking animation needs to be fixed, just to remind you.. Player two can't enter level two.
It's high priority for me :P. It's a big eye sore.. Also-- I think you can make Floryan bigger, because the hitbox is huge.
That would be cool.
The stand is just for when the character is not moving, but it is currently between the two walking frames which make the animation look jumpy.. I know you'll try your best. You always do!. I can make it so that the character slides at all times-- it looks kinda silly.
No-- if I tap the arrow keys it stays on one sprite.
I'll look into it.
I'm not sure what goes into coding, but the walking would need to switch between the two, instead of staying at the same one.. Like: end with sprite 3, start with sprite 1 again.. I still can't get player 1 working.
Sprite 1 would be walk 1, sprite 3 would be walk 3. Sprite 2 would be stand-- which I think should be the resting sprite.. Yeah!
That's what I mean.
Cool.. I think the victory spin should be faster, and the end level screen should occur after it has completed the animation
Cool.. I've got class now, but I'll keep beta testing :P. Using 1 and 2 as the buttons is pretty easy for when I use two hands.
But being able to set them would be cool.
Tah tah for now!
Thanks!. Oh! If anything-- I think you have the two walking animations in the wrong order, which is why it looks strange-- and if there's a stand pause inbetween the two, then there should be another-- a total of 4 frames, instead of 3.. It's so strange that my arrow keys won't move the character, but awsd will :P. Hello, cutie!
How goes things?
Whoa!!. I hope you're having a good time.
Homework and whatnot!. I need to write a little description about myself-- and it's tough writing about the person you should know the best.
:P. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Wow!!. I thought it wasn't high priority?
Awesome!. Good morning!
Who is Nick?. And the other person doesn't like theirs?. (Tell me which sprite it is). Never mind.. Nick is uploaded with a fresh purple shirt.
Aww :3. You're giving me too much credit.. How does adding controller support to your game sound? I've got the wireless adapter and two controllers.. (I know it's low priority-- just a thought). I'll get those keyboard keys to you eventually!. These are the "pressed" keys.. Look okay?
What about arrows?. Okay. I just sent it over.. Key, Key Pressed Down, and Key Highlight. All for... you!. What would be a cool website name?
It's about me!. Sure I can take a call.
just "www.petermattox.com"?. Or "www.petermattoxdesigns.com"? The shorter the better?
Okay, cool. I'll just have to pick a place to buy it from and to host it.
What kind?
I have not.. Yes, nothing from Domain.com.
Was I supposed to?
You sure?. Sounds like I was supposed to :P
Too much DDR?. Makin' you sweaty?
I can get the domain from Namecheap for $9.84.. So I think I'll do that.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
(hug). I love you.
Yay!!!!
Good morning!
Happy Saturday to you!. Need anything for games?
Sure!. I'm just eating leftovers.
Mhmm!. Carrots and sweet potatoes with rice and chicken :P
I can help you brainstorm!
You could make one about a boy who is cursed into becoming a cat :P. It could be called Cat Curse :P
Or you could make a game where you're stuffed animals inside a claw machine and you have to avoid the claw.
Oh no!. I should play that more so I'd be familiar with it :P
Wow.. I'll keep thinking!
Do you have Mario Party for the n64?
I don't recall it.
Hmmm... Do you need graphics from yours truly?. Make a game where you're a frog and you have to find a princess.
If you beat the game should the character have sick dance moves?
Yeah, I can make a green shirt.. You also wanted variations on the students in the classroom.. I wanted to make girls to populate the classroom, but long hair complicates things with the sprite sheet you gave me.
But the classroom needs diversity!
Don't they need the throwing animation?
I don't mind (:
I can make them 30% smaller too.. So no backward animation?
It doesn't look good because the pixels are different sizes.
Give me the other professors. You should you don't need me to add the throwing?. I already have throwing sprites so it's just a matter of "reskinning" them.
Oh I got this :p
Rawr to you!. What's my checklist? Other than the one you just gave me?. What's needed for the instruction background?. I know that the instruction background will need room for words and for those keys, maybe what the player looks like.. And it needs that twice because of the two players?
I'm looking at it. It doesn't answer my questions.
Yes, but there's a lot that needs to go into the instruction screen. I feel like I need wireframes that will show what you need/want, and I would finalize it.
I have letters-- but you haven't used much of my fonts.
What about .otf?
Probably.. I'll see what I can do :P
Things are okay.
Never too late. How are your classes?
Awesome!. Let me know how that works.
:P
Maybe!. But nothing I've heard about.
Sounds neat!. Sounds like it would work well as a 3d game or as a platformer.. I think it's a solid idea!. What style of art are you thinking of?
I mean 3D or 2D?
I can help make things adorable.
I've got to head over to Radford soon though, so I can't help now.. Oh-- I was thinking it could be more detailed.. Like an illustration or something.
I can make illustrations for the game if you like!
I can work on both!. Just watch me!
Okay!
Are those capybara?. !!!
!!!!!!!. And we can pet them?. I'ma hug one of them!. (maybe two?)
Neat!. This is my blurb: "Regardless of the medium, I have found comfort in the things that I create. I have been most influenced by the cartoons of my childhood, and I always consider motion whenever I design, illustrate, and animate. I am very detail oriented, and I often see many smaller pictures before the bigger picture is fully realized. ". And I cut words from the quote: "My goal whenever I create A design or an illustration is to make sure that each detail tells a story. "
I kind of offered my services and now I'm stuck putting the book together.. Five people have yet to give me their files.
It's like our "Yearbook" so I want it to look nice, but it was in such disrepair before I got to it.. The person who designed the master pages left a lot of errors, which meant everyone who designed their pages had to be redone.. Not completely redone of course-- just touched up.. I'm back in Blacksburg.
Tiresome.. Someone was supposed to meet me and help out, but they never showed.. I didn't volunteer to do all of the work-- I took initiative to start on the work, but no one ended up helping.
I had been, I've been emailing a lot of people.. And a lot of text messages (but they've stopped messaging me). I'm a little disappointed-- I was the color yellow in the book, but someone was forgotten, so the colors may shift and I won't be yellow anymore!
No-- it's Blue (cyan), Magenta, Yellow. It has to start with Blue (cyan) because it's representing CMYK
I'm not the lead designer.
:P
I just liked it the most out of the three colors.. And it looks nice with my spread.. Good morning.
I'm sorry that we didn't do that planning you had wanted to.
How can I tell that they are new? Are they different colors?
Oh, okay!
Specifically for ps2?. There are two types-- is it a slim or a regular?. Is it for James?. I should have a spare.
Whoa... you can use the ps2 slim adapter on your laptop?. I have two that I can place-- you are welcome to the second one.
Wait... Is it just a cable?. With a square side and a circular side?. http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/pict/321598290457_1.jpg. That would make sense based on the specifications you just gave me-- but I feel like your cable is the one with both sides being rounded.. http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41g4RsHi43L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg. I don't know what you want :P
Okay, just checking-- those are part of the ps2 slim cord, but I could probably just as easily find one, because they're not hard to come by.. Sorry that I missed your call, but it seems that your phone is turned off.. -- so I couldn't return it.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I hope you had a nice day.. Are you okay?
Layouts for the senior book.. Among other homework.. What did you do today?. I haven't forgotten about Classroom Heroes, I know you have a deadline coming up, so I'll try and crank out the art you need from me. Currently I'm going to try to paint my illustrations-- I want to get most done, but we'll see. My magazine is also important, so I might spend a while on it tomorrow.. I was driving earlier, by the way, which is why I couldn't answer your call. Otherwise I would have!
miscellaneous? more like mysterious.. You were saying something though?
Oh, okay. Well goodnight. Good luck with everything you're working on!
Sleep well!. I love you.
Good morning!
Hey, you!
How did studying go?
Awesome!. Sleep just crept up on you!
I have to finish my watercolor paintings, my magazine, and the artbook all at once.
I'm thinking I'll use my left hand for computer required activities, and my right for painting.. The watercolor paintings and the magazine are both due the same day.
The artbook is due tonight technically.. Oh yeah!. My feet will be feeding me.
This week.. Then I have finals.
You mean.. fun-als. Except that sounds like funnel.. But funnels are fun!. 2 paintings down and 19 to go.. These were the easy ones because they were just 1 color!. Fortunately I already have 3 of my pieces mounted from the show, so I don't have to worry about that part!
Yup yup!. Have an awesome day!. I'll be thinking about you while I work :3
Do you think seeing me Friday would be cool?
Wow, really?. Paige has a test to take in Charlottesville, so I could come with her and say hello!
It's her state boards so that she can become a licensed hair stylist.. I'm not positive what the test is called, but it happens to be in Charlottesville.
Super cool!. You can see her new car from the inside :O. Paige said she'd like to see you too (:
Starts at 10am or so and the individual program (for my BFA) should be around 12:30pm
Not yet.. It is not found in the system.
That's the one.
:P
Okay!. I'm still working on the art book. Almost done though!. I can try to get more sprites done by tomorrow night. Is that too late?
It's like our "yearbook". But it has all of the student art.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
It's just their favorite pieces, of course, so not "all" of the art :P
Early.
I suppose.. I haven't heard from Paige yet.. She has her test at 9am.. So before 9.. Paige is actually planning on going the night before.
She's going to stay in a hotel.
I'm not sure.. She didn't tell me that.
It's going alright. I'm tired, but quite the amount of work to do!. How is your day going?
Wow!
om nom!
Oh no!. Unforgivable D:
Everything's ending.
Wow!. I'm proud of you (:
WOW!. Magic!
I remember you didn't like that Grim Jr game because it was too easy.
I see...
Just trying to give you some sparks for lightning.. You might just have to pick one!. Oh-- I can bring that cable to you if I come with Paige.
Of course!
Sweet dreams to you!. Good morning!
I owe you a soda!
I love you too!!. Or both?. Root beer float, anyone?. :P
Oh no!. We were supposed to have one together!. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.. I messed up on one of my watercolor paintings-- and I'm a lil' disappointed :P
There's no time!. And I'd have to redo the pencil and pen lines :P
:P
That's what silly people do :P
My painting method isn't supposed to be perfect, but I painted the flower field too dark.
And I can't lighten it.. But it's not the worst thing.
At least I didn't paint Dorothy's face slightly green.. Oh wait.. I did.
Now she looks like the wicked witch.. I can fix these things in photoshop, but I like the originals being as close to how I wanted it in the first place.
Nah-- just want to tell someone. I know I can fix it, but I gotta confide in people.. It's our little secret now. Only you and I can know my mistakes :P
That's the first time I've seen that.. Oil and acrylic (even gouache) are reversible paints.. Watercolor is a different story :P
It's a shame :P. I hope you have a great day today!. I'm just going to be painting.. I know I said I could help yesterday on the game, but I can do that tonight, because I won't have watercolors to paint!
(hug)
You should get a dog!. Just kidding-- but if I had a dog, you can always visit said dog, and I'll try to have the dog trained.
It's probably stressful!. https://www.radford.edu/content/commencement-2016/home.html. Hello, Little Miss Sunshine!
Stress relief after they've been trained :P
I think I will be getting the Samsung Galaxy S7
I think so.. That helps, right?
I read that the edge has a larger screen and battery.
Yes.. It's larger :P. So many colors to choose from.... I think black is safe to go with.
What earlier comment?
It is silly. :P. But larger battery :P. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7973313?checkin=05%2F30%2F2016&checkout=06%2F01%2F2016&guests=2&s=4Oqoj1DB. But I don't think I'll be using the phone that extensively-- so a larger battery isn't necessary for me.. I found other links, and there are cheaper ones, but this one seems fairly convenient.
Okay-- I wasn't sure, but I should have assumed.. It said "Tokyo May 30th- June 1st" but I should have assumed based on "leaving Tokyo June 2nd". The cleaning fee and service fee make this location a bit pricier than what I previously found, but it looks okay.
They are all done.. I think I should make a new book cover that will match the paintings though.
I will be with Paige!. I'm not sure what to make the cover look like yet though!
Oh no!. Do you have a pair of tweezers?. You need to get off your foot, sanitize your foot and sanitize your tweezers.
You may also need a needle-- but you definitely need to get the glass out.
!!!. Wow!. I forgot you had that!. Good thing!
And it has my name, so you can remember me.
Clean it first too.
That is interesting. You should get a thin layer of fabric to put between your feet and the ground.
I can get you thin suede or leather if you like.. In fact-- I have a leather skirt I was going to use for the Scarecrow puppet boots-- but it's a bit too thick for puppet needs. It could work for you though.
Yeah. Just gotta cut feet out of it.
Okay. Sleep sounds good.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Thursday might be late, because I have a few things to finish up in Radford. But Friday would be all day-- if you're busy though, I don't have to come.
No-- it's from 9am to 11am (she said it could take up to 2 hours). But she would like to see you too.
Okay. I can spend time with you in the morning for sure.. Sleep tight.. There's an aphid flying around my room :O
ladybugs bite!. I'd be more concerned about them :P. Just kidding-- aphids can bite too :P. It's one of the fairy aphids, so maybe it's the hero?. Kind of cute? It's just a little puff ball!. Girl character? Possibly?
I know-- I was just testing something (it was quick). Took less than a minute.. I have class to get to, so I'll work on it a bit later!
No, she has eyelashes.
Oh :P. Should I fix it then?. (I'm going to walk to class now)
It's happening.. My dad doesn't want to pay $76 for Paige to stay in a hotel, and was wondering if he could pay your house $50 (which is like $5 per person?) for her to stay there.
It would be for just one day.. just for the day*. Silly words :P
That's what I mean. I'm not certain when.. That might depend on whether or not I come.
Wow!. At first I thought the house looked cute, but then I saw pottery and then scuba diving!
You left out 2 guests.. So it would be $75.
Total is still less though!. It's $169.. per night*
It looks nice, and I'm sure it's worth it, but I think we should save where we can.. But if you like it, I'm fine with going there! Especially if we can try pottery again.
Oh.. okay.. I just like making things I guess.... I think it can be up to you. The first listing definitely looked cuter.. Well.. I suppose they have their own qualities that make them nice.
But taught by a master Japanese craftsman?
Makes sense.. Do you think we should bring watercolor paints?. And paint the scenery together?
Cool!. Okay, whichever you think is best!. I suppose it would be nice to stay with the first listing.. But I think it's ultimately your choice, and I would be happy at either stay.
Okay (:
Do you want me to contact them?
Okay.
I can't wait for you.
Everything!. I'm going to get some sleep. Don't stay up too late.
Okay! Goodnight and sweet dreams, Cutie Pie1
Good morning!
Okay, that sounds good-- since we'll have Pocket Wifi at most of the locations.
Yeah. Should we get a refresher course?
Okay. Hopefully we'll dive okay :P
I think I'll be okay.
Hiking boots and walking sandals for me.
I'd have to check JC Penney out then!. Get that backpack for whenever yours dies :P. Paige passed her written exam!
That's the plan. These look like nice hiking boots: http://www.jcpenney.com/stafford-deacon-mens-wingtip-leather-boots/prod.jump?ppId=pp5004560043&catId=cat100300058&deptId=dept20000018&&_dyncharset=UTF-8&colorizedImg=DP0902201417014697M.TIF
I know!. I'm silly.
Gotta be comfortable!. Who knows-- if we don't keep comfortable, we might not be cuddly enough at night.. Or I'm just kidding...
I'm not sure.. They are welcome to whoever does.. http://www.jcpenney.com/st-johns-bay-atlantic-mens-hiking-boots/prod.jump?ppId=pp5005820543&catId=cat100300058&deptId=dept20000018&&_dyncharset=UTF-8&colorizedImg=DP0714201504194064M.TIF. These look good.. Do you want me to check for a pair for you?. http://www.ebay.com/itm/THE-NORTH-FACE-AMIRA-BACKPACK-BLACK-VERY-NICE-SHIPS-SAME-DAY-/282020475671?hash=item41a9baf317:g:shUAAOSw~oFXIoq1. http://www.ebay.com/itm/THE-NORTH-FACE-AMIRA-BACKPACK-BLACK-VERY-NICE-SHIPS-SAME-DAY-/282020475671?hash=item41a9baf317:g:shUAAOSw~oFXIoq1. Oops, sent both.. JC Penney is out of hiking boots for women in your size.
Of course :P. Are you sure? It's recommended around the foxes-- and probably rabbit island.
Okay-- so maybe I should just find sandals.
Might be a good idea to let my toes breath.. breathe*
Where was the enthusiasm when you actually saw them??. I'm there now :P
The Tin Man.. He'll be copper, ironically.
Takes a while though!
I don't have much.. But I sent it to you.
Sweet dreams to you.. I love you.. I got home late-- but the first thing I'll do in the morning is game assets. Has the list been updated at all?
I clicked submit, but I was given a white page-- so I'm not sure if it was successful or not.
I think it would be cool.
Yeah, I've read many of the cons.
I'm not sure.. There's Turner Broadcasting-- I could work for Cartoon Network.
What time is your group meeting?. I'm going to get started on your assets.
Thank you, that's much appreciated.. I forgot to take a picture of the wireframes, do you think you could send me one?
Then what's left? :P
You would just need the secondary button and the word "back"
Yeah, an arrow, the button, and "back"
Sorry-- I haven't gotten around to it.. Be right back.. 27.31cm for my feet, 175.26cm tall, 63.5kg
No :P. So I could be off.
27.3cm, 175.3cm, 63.5kg. I was taught 2 decimal points, and no more than 3.
I see :P. Did you want larger keys for the game?
I sent you the keys already, but do you need larger  ones?
I would only include the arrow and button-- I wouldn't include the words-- because you don't use them anyway.. Background for instructions and controls should be the same-- but I'm not sure what to make the background.. The background for the instructions and control page could just be the notebook paper that pops up.
I'll do it.. I have the kind from Europe, because that's where my family was.. I don't think I have any universal adaptors.
I don't have a laptop charger that isn't 3 pronged.. I sent you the invite.
https://www.airbnb.com/reservation/itinerary?code=4RKJ8W
Kyoto is 13-21 https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9194262
You asked for Kyoto dates.. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12550149
Listing for Tokyo too-- I gave you the earlier one by mistake.. Hiroshima: May 21 - 24, 2016. Takayama: May 24 - 27, 2016
Ito is the 28th.
I'm sorry.. I have to head over to Radford.. I'll talk to you when I get there.
How is the game design meeting?. I just sent you thrown candy, and the continue and back buttons.
Sure.
The one you sent looks nice-- It's the same link?
!!!. I'll check it out.
Okay!
I hear that in Australia they can hug you.
I'd argue that, but it is pretty cute.. I just made the booking.
I think that's you!
Oh snap!. I'm still working on the Tin Man.
Magazine still needs work too.
I have to print a lot of things for my portfolio class, and I have an essay + painting for my 20th century art history class.
It's quite a bit!. That would be cool!. So... definitely!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you, Leandra.
You just make me so nervous, but there's only the girl sugar cub to represent that!
I have  a 16gb sd card, but nothing that fancy.
Not really-- just point and shoot.. It's only slow because I have to set up each picture :P
Like rapid photos?
I've never done that :P. No?. I don't take photos that I don't need.. Unless it's on your phone.
Right-- and I said I've never done that with my camera, so I don't know.. But it's probably fine.. When is your meeting today?
Cool!
Rawr to you!
I'll check it out!. I thought I added "Instructions" and "Controls"
Called "start/restart screen". I may have dropped it in another folder by mistake.. My passport came in!
Of course!. I haven't seen the passport-- it's in Blacksburg.
Oh-- you need stuff for that from me!. A "Insufficient Funds" notice.
Cool!. Sideways frown or colon/parenthesis frown?. White opacity box needs to be 18x16... is that tall or wide?
So... wide?
18 pixels tall by 16 pixels wide?
Or 18 wide by 16 tall.. Photoshop tells me to put width first.
x is the width and y is the height. Usually.
I just thought you would know if you wanted it long or tall.. Just to make sure.. and ): or :(
Okay.
Okay-- so an actual frown.
Added. I added the black selection bars to the start/restart screen. Oh Insufficient funds needs to be red!
I made it in black and red-- red is usually an alert color, so it's a good idea.
resume and restart are similar in length, which made sense for them, but I can fix it.. Exit to Menu is much longer, but if their the only two :P. Added.
I'm not sure what you mean?. ???
Oh!. It's up.. As well as up and down versions (they're darker)
I gave you just arrows, just in case.. Sorry for being gone and here.. I'm just checking periodically while things are in the pickle.
No problem!
Of course. What's the notepad background?. I didn't realize that it was due so soon.. I'll get on it.. I have a paper I need to write, but I can stay up tonight.
Did I not give you "Exit to Menu"?. Paper animation is in reverse order.. That's just the order I had things, so I'm sorry if that's inconvenient.
How do you want the Exit to Menu button?. How large do you want it?. Do you want a box around it?. Is it definitely "Back" instead of "Exit"?
Haha :P. Umm.. desk and pencil?. Can I give those to you separately and you can do with them as you will?. I'm so tired :P. I want to take a nap, and wake up to do everything.
I'd be worried the pencil would take up too much space that you could use for words.. And I just thought that it would overlay the title screen.
That's where the animation goes over.
Oh.. okay.
Okay.. I made Qian.. And a back to menu button. Sorry for not getting things when you need them.. My paper is pretty important, and I'm struggling to do both.
:/
I'll try.. When is the project due forever?. When will you need the wood grain?
Okay. You'll get something pretty rough.
Wood Grain 2.png and Notebook on Wood.png are decent.. There you go.. It's up and loaded.. Wood Grain.png was rough, but I did some layering, and that's how we got Wood Grain 2.png. Hope it works.
I'm going to try to get a bit of sleep, then on to my paper.
I'm writing about Toulouse Lautrec, his influence on Art Nouveau, his method of making his posters (lithography), and whatnot.. I gave you a sticker????. I wish I could have done more for you.. I hadn't even touched the TA's for animation, and Weimer is a motionless boss.. Mark Sheriff doesn't even exist.
That's good.. Phew. I don't think I'm going to have enough time to finish this essay.. What name should I give to the made up Cabaret dancer?. I think those are the kind at Moulin Rouge. I just have to write about Art Nouveau and Toulouse-Lautrec-- the main parts of my paper :P. I would ask for help, but that's okay.. I can do this. And if I can't, then I shouldn't have started so late.
That sounds nice!. I just named it "Moulin Rouge". But Lucille would have been great!. My time crunch didn't allow for me to wait.. I just need some sources about Toulouse-Lautrec, William Bradley, and Jules Cheret (I was going to compare the three) and info about Art Nouveau.
Wow!. That's awesome!!. So it went well?. May have bother you for the final .jar file?. May I* bother you?
Whoa.. was I not supposed to be alive?
Oh.. yeah. I'm still alive.. https://www.radford.edu/content/commencement-2016/home/schedule.html. boop
:P. Standard for highlanders.
Sweet dreams to you!. I just need to find a tutorial.. I was just going to take one from the internets.. Good morning.
3
What time?
I hope I haven't missed the deadline.
Right now?. When do you need it?
What animations exactly?. I'm trying to get things done, but I'm slow.. Could you send me screen shots of all of the screens put together?
What other animations did you need?
No.. could you send me the pngs of the sprite sheets you are using?
Thanks!. All sprite sheets? Like for the candy and vp too?. I'm making a process book.. And Screenshots of gameplay
Oh, okay. I'll work with what I have. Which is everything, just in a jumbled mess.
I'm still trying!. If you don't need the Weimer sprite until later, I will get it to you as soon as I finish these here finals!
Aw man-- the walking animations aren't working.
Player 1 still doesn't work, but that's understandable.. I did.. I got what you gave me.
Hmmm.. Let me ask someone.. What program do you need to open a jar file?. Someone with a windows computer can't open it.. I thought it was Java.
They installed Java 8, but the animations aren't working still.. I think it's relying on the single pngs.. of the players.. But I'm not sure.
Maybe you didn't compile all of the resources with it?
Okay, thanks. It's over unfortunately :/. But thanks so much!. I should send you smoother animations.
Okay. I'm done now.. So I'll get on it right away.
Still working!. Can you incorporate them incrementally?
And if I send you the files in separate png's?
What do the frame names need to be?
Interesting. Okay.
Not sure! I've only completed left and right throws.
Mhmm.
Well I just finished the front, which took about 25 minutes.
I've completed the downleft one.. So all but one left.
Not exactly.
Okay-- I just added it. I'm not done, but I want you to have it.. I couldn't separate them though :/. I'm still working on it.
I'm not.. That's not what it's supposed to look like.
Okay.. Hold on!. Finished and sent.
Okay. I understand.. Sorry for being late.
Upload failed :(
Successful this time.. I thought that's what you were doing?
I'm sorry.. You probably could have!
Oh no! Cat stuck in the tree!
Oops!. Fixed.
Any time.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I love you.. Anything you need from me before I take my 3 hour nap?
Good morning!
RAWR! I love you!
(I'm not mad at you, but like Pusheen, I'm very invested in a yarn ball, but it's you)
Oh no!. I will stop.
(hug). Who knew you could make 4 cheesecakes in 3 hours?. They're definitely not perfect though.
A graduation cookout/dinner at my professors house!. I was only going to make 2, but I might have overdone the recipe!
There's an entire cake left (so that means two were eaten, and someone took one home). You can have some!. If you want (:
My professor really liked it!. He and his significant other saved 3 slices.. So it was a crowd pleaser.. I made sure to use organic oranges and lemons for my zest, because the peal has the most pesticide exposure, and I wanted to limit that.
I think it made a better cheesecake.. Anyway, I will save you a slice if you so care to have one. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you.
I hope your day was nice.. Good morning.
I checked. I'm trying to get it to you.
Is there a screenshot of the most recent build of the game?. Tickets are for inclement weather, but I will give you one just in case.. You can just show up though.
Perhaps not? I don't have another way of giving you the ticket without giving one to one of my family members and they give it to you.
A few screenshots from the (updated) different levels.. And you can if you like.. (meet me, that is). Goodnight and sweet dreams. See you tomorrow.
What do you mean?. I'm going to be in Radford-- whether you visit me or not is up to you.. It won't be raining tomorrow, so you shouldn't need a ticket.
I have to be there at 9am, so you can come at 9:30. That's when the band starts to play-- or you can come at 10 for the procession, but the commencement ceremony doesn't start until 10:30. Have a safe trip!. I hope your trip was safe.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
If you like! Parking is likely to be hectic tomorrow.
Yes?
I needed them when I asked for them earlier, but any time will do.. I'm probably leaving at 8:30 at the latest, because walking takes about 20 minutes.
Tuesday at the latest.. Hey, I know someone who wanted to play too :P. They called "dibs" on beta testing.
Cool.
Yeah.. Go for it.. I've lost my favorite pencil.. Never mind. I'm just silly.. Good morning!
I've been there!. I apologize if you were looking for a ride over.. My sister Paige and mother are coming though.
I already told you. I'm wearing gray and black.
No, it's the nicest clothing I own.
It's the Tommy Hilfiger shirt your mother gave me.. And the express pants that are pretty nice.. I suppose I could change shirts.. But I only have a green one-- and I don't think the material matches the material of the pants.
Thanks!. I was just going to walk, but a ride would be faster.. Do you like organic oranges?
I have the white pair of khakis.. But I might have gotten something on them.. They're probably fine.
You can welcome yourself in!
It shouldn't be.
Thank you.. Goodnight. Sleep well.
I don't "really" have any school work left.. Do you?
I sat down sleep crept upon me like a ninja.
Nope, it got me alright.. I was vulnerable.
What's wrong with the independents?
I suppose.. Unfortunately the lesser of two evils is still evil :P
You wouldn't go to the emergency room.. I don't think you told me.. Oh wait.. sorry-- I get it now.. I didn't know that you had no choice in eating the ice cream.
I thought that you could just avoid the chocolate, but it looks like its being force fed.
Well like-- I thought it was going to be more that the chocolate ice cream was there, but you didn't really support it, therefore you don't eat it.. Like-- it's the only option of ice cream, but you're not eating ice cream every day.
I understand-- I was just caught up on the fact that most people don't have to eat something they don't want to.. I wasn't thinking of a totalitarian state.
I understand.. My dad actually thinks that Trump is the lesser of the two evils in the situation.. Which is scary :P
He just trusts Hilary Clinton less.. Hillary*. And he said that "I don't think Trump is as dumb as we think he is"
Many people would say that Obamacare was not an effective plan, and that the latter two are crazy.
I don't trust either of them, because I think they're both after the presidency for the title alone, but with Trump, he just wants to expand his brand-- and he'll lie and say anything to get as many supporters as possible (even if he didn't believe what he says0. I don't think either would be a good figurehead, but I think Hillary has more experience with politics.
It's a strategy that is working.
Know your audience.. And appeal to them.
Not necessarily racist, but they just support other things that Hillary would take away?
Plus some people are so conservative that they wouldn't vote democratic even if they knew it were the better option.
Just a matter of who they are and their stubbornness.
I just said some people-- not all.
Some people will vote for republican first, then candidate second.. Some people have strong party affiliations that I don't think you're considering when you think of all of the people in the country.. Because there's a ton of reasons why someone would vote for someone, and you're saying that everyone is "rational voters" or something.. And by rational, I mean, that they consider it very carefully.
No-- it's different than that. It would be "I think Hillary is better, but I vote republican, so I will vote for Trump"
It's not that black and white though.. People support the party before they support the candidate.. Some people just want a republican as the president.. Regardless of who they think is the better candidate.. Some* though-- not all. Some people actually do think ahead, and I agree with you, but I think there's a good amount of people that would vote purely based on party affiliations.. And I think that you are dismissive of them, though they do exist.
Yes, but if you include all subsets, then you come up with a larger variety of people than that they're all racists.. What if racists were the minority?
Well they may not even be racists then-- they just have seen what certain people of that race can do, and it has frightened them into thinking that's how all of them are.. Though the minority of Muslims are the ones hurting people, they are the ones with the most publicity, which reach the most people, which paints the majority of Muslims in a bad light.
I guess I meant that they weren't racists, but I think media doesn't help people.. Because they're only showing portions.. And they are the bad portions.. (usually)
Have a nice Mother's Day!. I meant to bring the duck watercolor to Blacksburg, but I forgot it. It was a gift for your mother.. Oh-- Paige got a job already at Great Clips!. Just a little thing before you go.
Yeah, some just take it in as they see it.. And yeah! I'm proud of her.. I was surprised that it happened so quickly!
Her dream job is to cut hair.
But I suppose that the people that she works with are a factor.
So I think when she is no longer working with colleagues, but instead working with a "family" is when she will be at her dream job.
Probably not. It's lonely at the top.. I feel like she would want to cut hair for nice people.
Oh-- she also would like to do hair color.
She said "It's not my dream job, but it's cosmetology, which is something that I love, but I'm just starting out, which means I can't do everything-- I can't do color, which I really like"
Me too.. Just have to start out slow.
Super important.. Anyway, I won't keep you any longer. Have a nice day with your Mother!. She'll receive the watercolor one of these days (if she would even want it)
Would you like me to come with you?
Oh no! I left the first aid kit in Radford!
I guess there are the really small ones from Dollar Tree that we could add to.
What will we do about shaving if razors aren't allowed?
Okay, we can make a fun day of shopping tomorrow.
That too.
I'll find out,
That would be nice.
Sure.
Wait.. so milk mustaches? Really?
Yeah. Maybe I should have just made the mouth with four pixels at the top and 2 at the bottom.
I really thought it looked like a mouth with teeth!. Would you like the images via google drive?
Would you like for me to edit any of the lighting?. I worded that so weird.. Would you like me to fix the lighting in any of the photos?
Also-- I think we shot in RAW, which means you need a special program to open it in the first place.. So I would have to convert them all to .jpg. That may take a while, would you like me to?
Okay, I'll get right on it.
rawr
I did.
I guess it was.. A lot of notes though on how to fix the game.. Do you know how to program an epub?
I want to take a pdf and make it more interactive with a "page turning" animation.. I'm sure it's a thing, but I'm having a difficult time finding it.
I have never heard of this Calibre.
Oh--. I wanted to be able to have the flip universal-- it's for my professor.
I thought it would have been something involved in the html or something.. I've seen it online-- but I haven't found the best program yet.. Or a free one.
I have indesign, which is what I'm using to make the pdf, but I read that there was a way to make an interactive pdf or epub through indesign. It has a page turning animation, but it's only available for swf (Flash Player).
I want it to look like a book that you can turn the pages and it looks like the pages are physically turning. This would work on a computer as well as an ipad.
No.
They aren't necessarily static files. They have page transitions.
It did die, how sad.. I'm sending the pictures soon.
They are slowly adding and I've already shared the file with you on google drive.
Yes.
Could remind me which one that is again?
Sorry-- my chat has been going in and out.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
I've sent it.
I'm not sure yet-- I was going to pick the phone up tomorrow. I may have to buy a case from Bestbuy.. So it would depend on when I finish with that.
I can try for 1pm. I will let you know if anything happens to affect that.
Verizon opens at 9am, so I'll try to get there as soon as possible. I can always go to Bestbuy with you, since we'll be in the area.. Or I could wait to get a case-- maybe in Japan?
I know-- but we're leaving sooner than what I can order.
I was thinking the Defender Otterbox case.
Is that the type you have?
So useful!. I don't drop my phone very often.... But when I do!. Let me tell you... It's never good. Luckily this phone is built like a brick. But newer and smarter phones are fragile.. Amazon is the same price as Bestbuy.
Can't 100% trust ebay either.
It is when the ebay seller no longer is active when you go to return it.
They also have protection against selling fraudulent products, but those are still sold by 10s of thousands.. selling/buying
I am talking about top sellers.
lemon squeezy.
See all of what?
I gave you pretty much all of them.
Other ones were blurry.. Which ones are missing?
I made light corrections and had to save all of them as jpgs.. I was trying to save time by only doing the good ones.. or "good" ones.
Maybe you can pick out the other ones you want me to do?
There were either lighting issues or it was blurry.. Let's try again.
Maybe!. I got to go, I'll make sure to keep you informed whether or not I can still do 1pm.
Or run windows on my laptop-- because I have bootcamp on here.
It comes with the computer-- I just need a copy of windows something or other to use it.
Okay-- so we'll save that for together.. Bye for now. I'll see you later.
1955. Oops.
I see.. You can do that without me now.I just didn't realize that you could do something that needed me without me.I'll find a way to not be there. and have him there too :P. just kidding
when is this shindig? 
okay, neat (:
I'll see you then. I'll let you get to stuff in the mean time (:
me too :3
oh, I'll look up a recipe and make some. I've got spare time (:
okay, if I find time.. I'll make some, but if I don't we can go to 7-11 before
okay, that sounds like a good idea. but you can always add things later, right?
yeah! and I think she takes volunteers first
okay (:. well I'll let you get to things (:. bye bye for now cutie pie
I'm not cool. bye (: . Hello. :3
I'm okay, how are you?

ah, well, I should let you get to your cool stuff. you're probably really busy
bye.. have a good New Year
I don't know why something would...
no, I'm fine
I don't know where I'd be going though..
Really?. I thought you forgot..
and I didn't want to say anything incase you didn't want me over. it's 7:50
so.. I'm sorry
oh.. I didn't know I was supposed to head out.. so I was waiting
because you said "approximately 7:30". so I didn't know when approximately was
but that's okay, that means the egg nog should be done
I mean, maybe not okay for you.. but you know..
anyway, I'll see you soon. yeah, 7-11
bye. cutie pie :3
I'm not amazing, but I'll see you soon
I'm sorry :/

okay, well.. goodnight (:. I wish I could always be around you n' keep you warm at night. and.. just let you sleep on me whenever you like
I love yours :3
blankets are super nice. and warm :3
one day.. we can just.. sleep and watch silly tv shows. if.. you like
maybe.. sorry that's silly
you messed nothing up :3
Goodnight Leandra
you're the bestest ever :D
you're perfect.. but I'm still not sure if I didn't mess up or not
not false
I don't think you could either
Goodnight cutie pie, favorite girl, bestest friend, and girlfriend :3. byebye
aww.. I love you soo much :3. sorry.... sorry.. you're just so.. amazing :3. Have fun with everything today and with your friend........
okay. I meant your other friend though :P. I'd love to too if it were me. sorry for missing you
okay, good luck with your project. I fell in love with you suddenly :3. if you need any help, I'm always here
If you need the instrumental.. I found a download someone made. I bet it'll be amazing though
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=V8CVT7JT. it might not sound like what you want though
I'll look more though. you need like some reverb n' stuff
haha, for the chorus. it'll make your voice sound like it
sorry :P
oh, hey.. there's an actual Karaoke version on one of his albums. if I had that album I'd give it to you (:
but so far.. downloading it off the internet would be the only option
the album is Storm Front
I think.. that's what I was told
the one I sent you should be good though. maybe.. I don't know though. I'm sorry
there's nothing to thank me for... oh hey, my dream did have you in it last night, sorry-- that was random. but yeah.. I saw you there
you were in yours too?
that's.. crazy
you didn't want to be in my dream, you kept trying to leave. and you probably should leave and do your project too
I don't know.. I think my brain was still caught up in me messing up... and yeah, have fun (:. And remember, I'm always here to help you if you need it
you wouldn't be a bother. and missing me is silly
whoa.. actually wanting to go to school?. You must be out of your mind
very crazy. you're about the craziest person I know. and you know what?. I love you ;3. :3 *
I'm still sorry for things... by the way
well you didn't do anything wrong either... but umm.. have fun with your project.. I think I'm home alone for a while... so I'll go find something to do
and fries?
aww man.. I wanted to eat a few :/. well thank you for warning me. it's all rainy outside when it should be snowing
I don't know what to do on a rainy day
awww?
it would be possible for me... but you'd have to freeze time or something
time jump backwards a bunch of times
you gotta unsleep. oh you don't have to, you'd get rained on
and then you'd lose time that you could be using for your project
and if you got that all done then I could come and help you move it then beat you in donkey kong
I can help you find pictures!!
(: ?
You can send me your lyrics. then I can look up images that could work and send them to you
yeah :D. what do you mean? I wasn't going to do anything productive with my time . now I have something to do that can help you get done faster (:
110% positive
I'm your boyfriend. but I'm also your bestest friend
I would also like to beat you in Donkey Kong
partially kidding on that part
Yes (:
so yeah, send me your song lyrics
and I'll get to work looking for images. awesome (:
it's the least I can do :D. you've helped me so much in the past. plus I finished binding my book (:. not that that's important. but yeah, I'd love to help :3
well it's not too good, but it's my first one that I've done. but yeah, I'm here to help :D
I did. but less about that. more about your stuffs (:

piplup?. I think that's a pokemon

haha, I'll keep looking for pictures
okay, will do. but I'll try my bestest
what should I do with the images? just give you the links to each? or.. copy them n' stuff. ?*
okay, I'll try to (:
and then email them or.. flash drive?
that's silly, I should drop by to your house.. . because carrying a flash drive would be less work than carrying a computer
exactly :D
and then I can pick up my bike.. weren't you listening, you silly head
whoa.. oh yeah
I trust you . (:. okay, get to the lyrics then. who were the explorers for france and britain?. it was like.. Cabot and.. Cartier?
not really
or both :D. Let me go get a flash drive really fast so that I can be super quick with everything
haha... well I'll try
that's silly. I've only gotten to France and Britain :/

oh, never mind, I think I found an image for it after all
haha, I love you :3
you're doing great (:. I can't find where North Carolina became independent

okay, sorry for not being able to handle it :/. and the verse after that.. is that like.. one, two, or three??
haha.. it's okay. Done. I hope. I got a bunch of images (:. I hope that's good enough :D
I got enough for the 3 verses 
do you want them now?
now as in.. I can deliver them to you 
unless you want me to get more images
I only did 3 verses. and I didn't even do the chorus :/
yes I do (:. and then I'll look for more photos ^_^

You deserve so much though.. I just hope I can give you everything
not quite.. but I'll get there
oh no. I got more images (:. I'm not sure about women's Rights though
aw.. I just found an image for it
that sounds better though :D. My grandfather was a Free Mason :P. not that that's relevant :P
I never met him, but if I did.. I bet he'd give me a treasure map or something. okay, I got more images. I can't get any more without more lyrics though. did you know that the Free Masons founded America?. sorry.. that stuff isn't importnat. important*
George Washington was too. but continue with your lyrics please (:

I love you too (:. not that you were there to read that.. bye. I'm sorry :'(. I don't deserve you... I don't even know why you would want me. and so far it doesn't seem like you do. because you let go and pushed me to the back. and I just don't want to bother you. You're way too perfect and amazing for me to bother you.. . so I'll try to never bother you again. even if that means that I don't talk to you again. because I love you so much and you deserve so much more than me. so I'm sorry for ever wanting to be yours. I'm just.. not okay right now... but you were okay with letting me go.. so I understand. I'm just sooo sorry. I'll stop now
I'm... okay
You don't have to make me a sandwich.. . my day was okay. How was your day?. sorry :/. you probably have stuff to do. like study for physics. or... your project. or anything
no one has asked me. no one really cared to ask
I just didn't go... and nah.. I doubt it
I don't think anyone cares
my reasoning is.. confidential 
yeah.. kinda. I'm sorry your day was empty
but I doubt you could miss me.. so that part should be okay. I guess that could do it for you
I wouldn't think so
it's not.. but thanks
picked what?
you're not really making much sense
if you say so. and it's okay. I'd say it back, but I don't think it's something you'd want to read. I'm sorry :/
maybe from someone else. because I'm not that great
I'm not the best.. I don't even know why you like me... all I do is mess up
a little lot?. my voice isn't too great at the moment..
well you can't really see it now..
I did not
I didn't. nope
no
no and no. I didn't do anything
well then you shouldn't make a sandwich for me tomorrow then. just to be safe
but if I'm not at school tomorrow..
you're just going to have to eat all of those sammiches. and then you'll get fat
completely kidding, of course
exactly, that's how you win the love of your life
I'm the fat cat?
yeah.. the other thing....
oh, well let me let you get to it. talking to me isn't important

soup is magical and does what it wants
I wish I was magic. but I'm not
gas?. sorry.. kidding. I don't know.. maybe it just happens
that's silly.. magic doesn't exist. and if it did.. then I wouldn't be it
not cheesy enough. because I like cheese
I like pepper jack. sorry. I'll stop wasting your time
that's all silly. I'm lame
nope
I love you too, Leandra. goodnight and sweet dreams
I still have those unopened. bye bye cutie pie. sorry.... I'm sorry... I'll go :/

Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too

your*
it would have been warm. I mean.. nice*. ^_^
whoa..how'd ya know?
thanks :3. that means a lot coming from you. I strive to be the bestest pillow ever
I think so :3. as long as you don't find a better pillow.. or a nicer one. maybe a taller one too
well.. if you ever get tired of this old pillow.. then you can always throw me away. but yeah, tah tah for now
What about when you get a small house and move from place to place?
or when you want a "hubby"?
I doubt I'd be there
husband?. :P
I don't know
when you want a guy to sit at the table with you and eat breakfast with you and say "hey, you're beautiful" even after you just woke up. by that time you'll probably have forgotten about me
what? but that guy is on Unfabulous . he's not even real. anyway, good luck with studying and goodnight (:. I wish I could say that to you every night. I wish I could say that I love you every night :3. because I'm yours for as long as you want me...
I love you too :3. I hope that that's true
if that's the case I'd spend all my time with you
noo, never
You're crazy to think that..
I might be crazy too.. because I think that you'd get tired of me eventually
Maybe we're both crazy :3. sorry.. bye bye cutie pie
thanks (:. aww.. I'm going to have to run alone tomorrow
crazy in love?
oh.. okay. well, never mind then
just not crazy?. darn
haha, just kidding
You make me dopey

and I still don't know why you thought I'd get mad at you. silly :P
(:. Bye bye

I love you more than that to just get mad over it
it's okay :3. I'm glad you're safe :D
and happy (:

so it's true then?. that I'm just your friend?. because I wouldn't blame you. because I'm really really lame. you acted like I was crazy when I wanted to walk with you earlier..
if you say so :/
oh, I have nothing to do. but okay.. goodnight Leandra
my beds been oddly cold recently
it's missing you. just kidding. of course...

it's just cold though
no you don't.. you never say anything bad
I never notice
be more productive. do it
!!!
and then you'll have a whole 5 days of partying!. I'm sorry for saying creepy things.. and not being a good boyfriend. if you even would call me a boyfriend
What? We have a holiday weekend and you won't party during it?. that's sad :(
I was hoping to party with you. but probably not. you're always so busy
Hey, I can help you then :D. if you need help finishing things. but okay, bye bye 
Well I could just be moral support
and just there to like.. hug you if you get frustrated
Yay :D
okay, bye bye cutie pie
You too :3
aww, you too. sorry I missed you. I don't have much need for the luck though :P. good luck with the tacos. and bye I guess.. sorry again. I was waiting around to talk to you.. but I guess I did a poor job
well I mean.. it's today. :P. I'm not cool though. tomorrow, I might need the luck. nope... poor job, you're gone again. but anyway, bye I guess. have bunches of fun with everything. good luck for tomorrow (:
I have that glue.. if you ever did need it
When would you like i?. it*
I can get it to you now.. I've got a bit of free time. but I guess that couldn't work for you. break would work for me too I guess
I'll try not to forget and get it to you tomorrow
are you serious?. Or do you just want to see me?
oh, okay . ;. :P *
sorry
whoa.. I didn't know you could do that
take away my sorries
oh, well.. I'm sorry then

yes :D
I should work on physics
I doubt it
okay, thank you! :D
you'll do great too
gotcha. thank you :3
whatever helps (:
my throat hurts a lil' :/. and my leg... not that, that is important. you should focus on your homework. sorry for telling you. sorry. I should let you get to things
It started when I got home
It probably is. but.. where am I going to find tacos?
I don't know where to get any :/
aww.. it is. I don't know what that means though
oh no
ah. makes sense
yups
pretty much. and so do you
so I should let you get to things :D
don't remind me that I don't have tacos. just taco shells
or break food o.o ?
you got this!!!
I believe in you (:
Good luck
goodnight and sweet dreams for later. bye bye cutie pie
that's silly. bye
I love you too :3. I don't know why you had to hide that though :/
well thank you :D. I really do love you :3. Bunches and bunches ^_^
I was thinking that :D. bye bye. have oodles and noodles of fun ^_^
me? fun? that's crazy talk
nope. not true. goodnight, Leandra. sorry
I hope you study well. I'm.. okay. you?
that's cool. good luck
I don't know.. :/. I'm going to fail it just like physics. but I guess I should let you go to study
nope.. not me
That's crazy talk.. I'm sure you're smarter than I am
uh uh. no way
me too. but I'm sure you'll do great
why?. you've got like.. a whole day
yeah, a whole day without me
that's silly. and a waste of your time
nah. not me :P
that may be true.. but there could be other chat boxs . boxes* 
whoa. crazy
yeah
random people messaging you that you don't even notice
hey.. who knows
yes. plus talking to just me sounds sorta lame. because it's me... and I'm lame
that's crazy talk. :P. but I should let you go study
whoa, Hugo?. But it ends tonight
it's even better! . What are you talking about?. It's like.. the bestest :3
I really like spending time with you too :3. but I don't see how that makes you lucky :P
who?. :(
aww.. sorry, I should let you get to your stuff. me? that's silly.. i thought you said amazing guy. but umm.. I should let you get to things.. so bye bye cutie pie
I love you so snow much too :3. so don't be sorry. I'm in a lot of pain right now.. so.. I'm going to.. . I don't know.. I can't really help it
did I mention that I fell in my exam?. I don't remember. it doesn't matter. just go do your stuff and don't worry about it
It's fine.. just get to studying
I'm sorry
what if?. I feel like I might pass out
I've got a day to live. but maybe he was wrong :P. just kidding.. of course
Goodnight and sweet dreams :3
yeah, I'm okay at the moment. good luck on your exam. and you make me super happy too :3
sweet dreams to you too. but.. I don't think I'm going to do too well. and tomorrow won't be too great
nope
uh uh. because I'm going to fail my exam and then I'm going to be on the track bus alone and then I'm not going to run well and then I. 'll get home and fall asleep and then Saturday I'll stay home alone and then I'll be alone on Sunday. and yeah.. I don't think I'm going to like tomorrow
and now I'm going to have to stop studying and go to sleep because I'm still not feeling well. and I'll know even less what I should for tomorrow
It
's okay
and that's not how it'll happen at all :/. I'll know maybe half of what I need to know, but still do poorly
that's never how it works out... and then I'll stay on the bus and just.. sit there and do nothing. and then I'll be at the meet and wait alone until I have to run and then everyone else will be faster than me.
life doesn't work that way
I'm thinking realistically here... and things hardly ever work out
well that makes it give and take
:/
I was just.. thinking. sorry. just forget about it
goodnight. nothing.. it's nothing
I'm probably just still feeling light headed
okay... goodnight. I love you, Leandra. sorry
uh uh, but you are :3
there are youtube videos detailing everything for math :P
you're no average gal
you're purrfect :3
nope :3. You. are the most amazing girl I've ever met. and I'm the luckiest guy ever. and you're sandwiches are like.. magic . I don't know how you do it
they've got strawberries . and like.. jam
and like.. love. and magic
and sweetness 
well I love yours :3. and I love you. (:
tah tah for now :3
thank you for everything. Good luck tomorrow and goodnight.. I wish you were here to talk to... sorry :/ have fun tomorrow! I bet it'll be awesome because you won't have me around to waste your time
I hope you did well and were really fast just like that hello :3 who am I kidding.. you were probably fantastic!!! goodnight and sweet dreams and I hope you return safely ^_^. Good morning and good afternoon :3 I hope you're having a super awesome day :D
sorry aww... I missed you :/. I wish you were still there.. but I guess I don't have that kind of luck. well.. I hope you're having a lot of fun.. 
you're not still there, silly
because my luck isn't good enough for you to be
ahhhh
whoa, really?. that's.. crazy
if only that were true :P
okay. I'll do that then. anyway. I'm sure you have stuff to get to
it's been lonely. yours?
don't be missing stuffs :P. you should go be productive
what are you missing?
well.. I'm sure. I bet he's really cool...
well.. I hope he makes you happy. I guess happier than I could
since what?
that's crazy
haha. nice. well.. bye I guess
I'm playing Sonic on my Sega Genesis. nothing.. important. you?
it's crazy. and I just hooked it up
the graphics aren't too bad
he's a hedgehog. I've been playing. you could play too.. there are two controllers
yes it is. but you're probably busy
and or.. don't want to. well.. I'm actually home alone
so... you're mom probably wouldn't be okay with it
why would my mom not be okay with it? 
it wouldn't be a problem.. but I don't know. you probably don't want to see me
thought so. I died again.. in sonic.. so I don't think I'm going to play any more
you should probably get to fun stuff... and/or productive stuff. I'll go and continue to be alone
everyone is in harrisonburg. and if only I were there. then you could have fun :p
umm all day
!!. That must be why I have no food in this house. .. I'm so cold :P
noo
not allowed :P. you're mommy said so. no heated blankets.. and I don't even know where the thermostat is
it's okay. it's not really the same :P
It's never really been.. important. okay.. I know where it is. but the last time I touched it I got in trouble.. so I steer clear from it
nah. that's silly
aw, lucky
so lucky. I wish I could make a tiny snowman . but I don't have much snow here
aw.. you're right
oh, well.. okay. anyway, I should let you get to things
fun things?
more fun things?
uh uh.. actual fun things. like.. playing video games, or drawing rocket ships, or writings essays, or.. eating food. or being warm. or watching unfabulous . or sleeping
nope.. mine was.. just.. a track meet
crazy. it's all dark to me
which song was it?. I didn't have any music when I was on the bus
nice
they didn't talk to me... oh, it wasn't charged and I misplaced my charger
yeah.. so I was just all.. cold by myself
okay
you already read it?
I couldn't just.. have you read it again
It's okay..
I could read it on my own or something
It's fine
It's okay.. . you already read it...
it's fine...
I wouldn't want you to read it more than you have to
You only have it for a week.. so it's okay
I should be.. but I don't know.. today was my free day
and I'm still offering
but maybe I can just let you have the glue
well if you insist
it's okay
nah, I don't have anything to do over this break
nah.. it makes it all.. boring
nice. anyway, I should let you do stuffs. be it fun or just productive
uh uh, not stalkerish at all. I have nothing to get to, because I'm alone. maybe.. find something to eat
there's not much here to eat :P. but yeah
I'm probably just wasting you time
not really
but umm.. yeah. I'll let you get to stuffs on the off chance that I get to see you tomorrow..
I don't have any of that
but but.. if you got stuffs done.. then I could see you tomorrow.. and maybe. I don't know... never mind.. sorry. but I don't know.. I couldn't find much. sorry...
you just gotta do it :3
I believe in you
you can do it!!!. you just gotta believe in yourself too
oh.. okay
haha, I always do. :3
If you start you'll find it to get easier and easier. :D
please?
do it for me?. sorry.. I can't ask that
I wish I could be there for you to help you start. sorry.. I'm not even any help
sorry
I'm sorry.. . I wish I were good enough for you...
no way
nope, it's impossible
uh uh
I'm sorry.. I should let you do stuff. I'm not good enough though. maybe one day... probably not though
I love you too, Leandra :3
but don't you worry.. I'll try to be everything I can be for you :3
I'm going to go do stuff so my dad will be happy and so I can see you maybe tomorrow :3
yup. but no... I'll just find someway to help out . because.. I wanna see you. sorry.. that's silly. but I do want to :3. so goodnight and sweet dreams. and good luck with stuff (:
it's okay. it's not like you offered/had to/needed to/it's okay :D. /you're cute :3. sorry.. . You should read Huckleberry Finn until you fall asleep. but.. ditch it on the floor before because you don't want to rip it up. bye bye cutie pie. I love you :3. Sweet dreams and everything
it's okay :D
anyway, bye bye cutie :3
good luck with everything
thank you, but you need them more :D. bye
You're so amazing :3
Hello :3
I am okay, how are you today?
neat :D
whoa.. that still means you've got pineapple :D. which is delicious
ah, oh well
I've never had a pina colada. I've had.. fake pina colada. but.. yeah
lucky
yeah, I've only had the artificial kind
nice :D
that's true. silly bees
right. are you going to practice?
whoa, why?
alone?!?. :p
that sounds like fun. :D. I'm going to bike there
haha. It's okay. I'm all out of the way
and I'm a distraction
haha, you wouldn't want me in the car :P. that's silly
that's crazy. biking alone would be fine though. I don't want to be the cause of a car crash
that's doubtful
it would be very nice of you
but it's okay (:. well.. if you're okay with it
well okay
I'll get ready for practice then. okay, well.. see you at some time then. It's okay if you can't.. because I've got a bicycle 
sounds fine with me
thanks (. (: *
and you won't crash. okay, bye bye cutie pie
I love you too :3. I'm sorry for missing you and your butterflies. haha, I just thought of "butlerflies". :P. sorry, goodnight in case I don't get a chance to say it later. bye bye cutie pie ;3. :3 *. oh and sweet dreams :D
yes
and they wear butterflies as bow ties. I'm not cool, silly
I'm calling you silly
whoa.. you're so crazy
risking your life n' all
I'm okay... Haven't done much
Practice was okay. and yeah.. just okay. How are you?
Well I didn't see you... sorry.... sorry, umm.. I should let you get to your homework stuff
whoa, really?. I should  probably.. become decent enough for you to see me
I mean.. like.. decent :D
but it will give you time to fix "stuffs"
haha, tackle :3
see? that means that it could work out. so.. does that mean I should go over and see you as soon as possible?
okay. it's okay if she says no.. which is what I'll be expecting 
It should be opened since the students are back. but it's okay, you could just do your homework stuffs
seeing me isn't so great
waiting :P
"I beg to differ"
It sounds like fun. like.. a lot of fun. especially with you
I don't know.. should I bring things?
but but.. it's not so magic at the moment :/
and I don't know what kind of magic stuffs to put into it. whoa.. iPad guy?
okay. what's iPad guy?
You have an iPad?. I didn't know that
oh. okay. well, that sounds pretty magic
Me too. and.. become more decent. so umm.. when should I meet you there?
oh, okay, what time?
It's maybe a lil' chilly
you can always borrow mine if it gets colder though
okay, 4?
umm.. how about like.. 4:10?. :P
haha, not much of a difference. but yeah. Bring what you want. but mostly just yourself
well see you soon then, bye bye cutie pie :3
be safe.. and good luck with your space craft and everything.. I'm sorry I wasn't so useful.. but I'll try to not be a distraction, so I'll go outside away from the computer just so you can get everything done... I wish I could be more helpful and I just remembered I never gave you the glue.. I'm so..... I'm sorry.. have fun- I'll be outside.. for a while. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. I'm so sorry :/
uh uh . You're amazing . Good night and sweet dreams! You're the most amazing girl I've ever met :3 and I'm so so soo lucky. oh, and good morning :3
sorry :( I just got home from an orthodontist appointment. I like.. sat in a chair for about two hours and then it took six seconds for the doctor to do what he had to do. which was crazy.. it made me super sleepy too, but that's just random.. so I'm sorry. I'm hoping your day has been going super nicely too. sorry
maybe :P
I guess they do? :P
I'm sorry
nah, that's crazy talk. I'm not that great
uh uh.. no amazing here. just you
nope, just amazing Leandra. the amazing. who is.. amazing. yeah, that's you. I'm Average Pete.. the worst Billiards player of all the east. or.. west. or just everywhere in general. sorry.. umm.. I should let you get to things
not really
but yeah, you should get to things
haha, a rematch would be awesome
haha, okay. but yeah.. have a lot of fun today
thanks...
It's crazy
I think... haha, yeah. then it'll snow
I saw some snow earlier
it was crazy.... haha. yeah..
okay
I gotcha
Go get um. or.. em*
are they taken care of?
haha. nice
that'll teach em
I guess so
Oooh?
oh.. okay
what was it?
oh, okay. well, I'll let you get to things. sigh.. I miss you... sorry. that's silly. I'm sorry. I'll just go n' stuff
I wish I could've gotten to see you today, but I guess that won't happen
one day?. sorry. haha... okay
sorry. I'll let you get to things
haha, Hugo and me?. that would be neat..
it does.. oh well...
I gotta get that glue to you.. it's not like.. that special glue anyway . you're chat is all crazy
I would help.. but I don't know when you'd be able to..
  not really. sounds like a nice time. I just wish I could have seen you today.. but I guess my wishes just don't come true. it's okay either way.. it's not like I 'deserve' to. sorry... and sorry for wasting you time. I'll let you get to more important stuff
you are the coolest person to hang out with though.. the bestest :3. but I'm not that great. so it's okay. have fun with your stuffs. I'm not the bestest... I'm just some guy
then I'm just some other guy>. ?*. I'm nothing special
I don't think so.... but thanks
... okay
okay... I'm sorry for wasting your time. I'll let you get to things
I've seen that before. yeah...
yeah, seen it. of course... so I must be wasting your time...
that's crazy... I'm just lame
you're crazy.... I'm still sorry
it's okay
umm.. have fun with stuff you gotta do. I'll get out of your way. I'm sorry for stuffs
nothing.. just forget about it.. go get to your stuffs. bye
I'm sorry... get to your stuffs
it's important
nothing, it doesn't matter
It just doesn't matter in general
you have stuffs to do. I'm not something to worry about
prevent what? worrying?. I got lost :(
I'm sorry.. you don't have to
I guess I just shouldn't get my hopes up.. ever... with anything
so I'll try better...
I guess.. but they do come crashing down.. more often than staying up in the air
:3. sorry..
I meant try better at not getting my hopes up
I understand.. just.. my hopes are pretty down right about now I guess
it's nothing. maybe part of it is that I didn't see you today.. but that sounds really silly
sorry.... because mario is about to hit them?
or.. already hit them?
it's a Koopa Troopa shell. it has to have one inside
exactly. they just can't leave and be.. naked.... anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time... and it looks like I ran out of milk.... sorry, random. but umm.. yeah. have fun with stuff. bye
if only. sigh.. I think I should go. so bye.... sorry for being... yeah, bye. I'm all home alone and I think I need to bike to robotics..
It's fine.. I'm already ready to bike there. plus It'd just be another waste of time. you should be doing your important things. not Demetri Martin stuff though. so.. bye. have fun. I'm just going to go... bye. if I die out there.. then goodnight and sweet dreams. sorry.. not that it matters...
thanks..
it sounds silly.. but I'm sort of scared of getting there... and there's no way that you can prevent it from happening
It's dark and slippery outside
it's okay
thanks... I'm sorry for everything. If I get into a bike wreck.. I just want you to know.. stuff.. stuff that I won't tell you. but I want you to know it... but bye. k.... sorry.. bye
:/
That would make a lot of things seem out of context. I'm sorry. I'm happy.. I'm just.. sad at the same time
if that makes sense
because like.. who would like me? I'm not much to like.. . I don't know... I'm sorry. "not first on the list to kiss"? or however that song goes.. 
Yeah.. but I should go.. out there in the cold. growing lonely growing old. I like you too. and it counts the most
sorry.
I don't blame you though... yeah. good idea. because that's how they made hot potato
and to win you had to hold on the potato the longest?. because that meant you were warm?
yeah.. well.. I should go.. bye
I can't take my time, I'm all late
I'm still.. worried though
sorry for some of my comments . they weren't that great..
with k's and what not. it's okay..
I'm just scared that.. if I leave now.. then what if something happens to me?. I don't know.. then I'd never see you again. It's not a rational thought.. but I don't want to leave you.. or anything
but it'd probably be best for you though..
and then you could just get a better boyfriend
And you two would just kiss and eat a whole bunch until you died
(quote from Adventure Time)
me? that's nonsense.... I actually don't believe it...
I bet it's a good combo!!
and bacon bits. and cheese 
and butter
honey butter!. yeah, we both don't believe it because it isn't true. I mean.. why would you want to? It's me.. of all people.. and that's just gross... anyway.. bye. I'm sorry for saying things. sorry.... i gotta go :/
I'm not the only one.. because I don't think there is anyone..
like.. there's just no one in general. sorry.. and sorry for not being so great.. and sorry for saying those things. you wouldn't though...
sorry.. there's no one that you would kiss/even want to
sorry.... bye
I love you that much times like.. my arm span
but it's yours times mine.. 
so I win
http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/37198be4-96e9-4d38-ad1e-a67186f80223.jpg. bye... it's not me though. I'm not good enough. so bye. I gotta run. or dash. or bike off. or.. something. bye
times that
:3
sorry...
bye. I wish...
It was nothing... I really don't like myself and I'd go as far to say that I hate myself.. but for now I just really don't like myself... not that you'd care.. by the way, it's freezing outside, but it's not like you'd care... I'm going to go curl up under a bunch of blankets and try not to cry... because I really feel like I want to.. but I won't.... goodnight and sweet dreams, I wish you didn't have to put up with me because you deserve so much more.. I'm terrible. sorry.. for sending that... but goodnight anyways... so sorry.. I can't feel my feet, or my fingers for that matter... you probably won't get this until much later.. and I hope you don't....                                                 goodnight and sweet dreams :D. sorry
I should let you get some sleep. so goodnight
It's pretty late. well that too. if you want some soup
sure
because to me it isn't true
bunnies do have trouble with that word. It's okay though.. being super amazing just isn't cut out for me
because his inability to pronounce things just made him cuter
I'm not though
that's crazy talk. because I couldn't be that great. sorry..
yes?
it's okay, you scared me
if you like
I thought you would say something else
Now I know I'm not worth the wait I guess.. thanks for clearing that up. sweet dreams
I'm not worth anything.. you didn't even want to look at me, so I'm sorry for whatever I did.. I wanted to wait with you, or at least give you a ride... but I guess you wouldn't want one from some lame guy... I'm so sorry. good luck with your AP US and the rocket.. I'm sure you'll do something innovative that no one has ever done.. ever.. I'm sorry for doubting you :/ You can do anything you put your mind to, it's just hard to come up with something never come up with before.. but you're super creative and I believe in you... I'm sorry :/. and if you really didn't want that pop tart I could have taken it.. I'm sorry :/ you looked so.. disappointed/upset at me.. so I'm sorry :(. I feel like I'm awful at everything, and I'm just going to go.. and leave forever.. sorry :/ have fun with you stuff. :/ you probably don't want me around ever 
I'm sorry.. but I do think that you're "right". if by that then like.. the right girl for me?. because you're perfect.. but maybe I'm not the right guy.. because I'm no fun.. . I miss you too.. and I missed you calls :/ I'd call back but I don't want to bother you. your* calls. sorry
whoa. you should be working
yeah, do those three (:
aww :3
I'm sorry for those inhibitions
okay, get going!! :3. I asked people at robotics about rockets. like yesterday
but they didn't tell me much and they got all busy
You were never just an average girl :3. You've always been perfect
I mean, what could you be afraid of.. you're like.. magic. and magic people don't get scared
You're more than enough :3
I'm always worried I'm not enough. Maybe we can be magic together!!
So to be more than enough.. I give you pop tarts and other fatty/sugary treats. Aww.. can I have the beard?!?
don't you worry
you'd probably think it to be gross and I'd have to shave it off anyway. It's fine by me if you never leave. (song). It's by that guy who does the Gotta Keep Yo Head Up. I'm thinkin' you're the girl for me :3
Exactly him :D. but with a beard.. my chances of.... I'm going to stop that. sorry. :P. umm get to your stuffs. :D
beards are itchy..
and girls don't like them
I don't know... I think they just get tired of shaving constantly 
I was saying though.. silly stuff
yes, they do. do girls really shave?. Because I'm pretty sure guys are hairier than girls.. so guys shaving is more.. likely
I've never seen a girl shave..
do they?. :P
weird
I thought girls shaved their legs. or are they just magically not hairy?
crazy..
sorry for that
yeah, they are hairless 
yup
I was thinking that!!!
sorry... anyway, I'm sorry for this getting as deep as it did.. I should let you do your stuff
I'm sorry. it's really lame
I was saying though, girls don't like kissing beards?. but okay, go go go :D. sorry. still. bye bye cutie pie. sorry...
sorry, bye
the k stuff. tah tah for now. goodnight and sweet dreams :3
I love you too :3. you and your walrus face :3. but mostly you :D. and I wish I could sing.. . if I could I would sing to you
my everything isn't great. and I messed up a lot today. I can't sing though :/. but goodnight. and sweet dreams cutie pie
oh, I did
I tried to get a book cover printed at office max and I didn't save the appropriate font, so it doesn't look so great
It's not alright :/. because it printed anyway . and it's not what I need 
I don't think you quite understand where I'm coming from. the font on the entire thing is wrong. which made one of the words too big. which made it spelled wrong. which means I can't fix it
I can only print a new version... that's the only way it can work out. yeah, but that costs money. so I wasted money. on something I can't use
....
It's more expensive than you probably think..
I know you're trying to shed light on it.. 
but you really can't. I know.. money doesn't mean anything.. but I shouldn't waste it
It doesn't bother me. I just forgot to save the file font. so it's my fault. and it was something I should have thought of
what's good?. That it's my fault? that I can't do anything right?. yeah.. such a good thign. thing*. I can't even finish another book. because I have writers block.. 
I still don't think you understand.. but thanks. I think
no I mean.. you're trying to put a good spin on it. however, there isn't any good side to it
I just messed up.. 
I mean.. it wasn't my money. so.. maybe that could help you?
Yeah.. so it's bad that I wasted not my money
even though I fixed it now.. I still messed up before
what were you going to say?
or.. just go and sleep. never mind
Right..
well I don't feel bad.. 
if that's what you thought
I just shouldn't have over looked that mistake. because I wasn't there at Office Max to find out sooner
I wish I didn't tell you..
I kinda just want you to say "Oh, well I'm sorry..". "sorry to hear that". but you're making it worse. because you're just like "Don't worry, it's all hunky-dory". but it's not.. 
sad face?
I'm sorry..
I shouldn't have.... I should just go... and curl up in a ball.. . because now I don't feel good.... I'm sorry
goodnight and sweet dreams
you say stuff amazingly
just.. I didn't want to hear a positive spin on something..
It was like.. you saying those things made the situation seem worse.. in a weird way
when I was just fine with my mistake. sorry... I'm an awful person. who can't say anything right. have fun tonight
Like.. I didn't need cheering up..
a "that's unfortunate"
I am though... I'm a terrible person
....
thanks.... for putting a good spin on it again
I'm sorry
I'm going to curl up in that ball. goodnight. sorry for the sad face
I'm sorry
:(
I'm sorry. you didn't do anything
you didn't make me unhappy. I'm sorry :/
I think I did... I'm sorry. umm.. bye
bye :/
have fun, Leandra
I love you too.. but how could you love me?. I'm terrible :/
that's just because you're in my heart. sorry.. that's cheesy
sigh.. I don't deserve you.... I never did
I'm sorry too. bye bye
me?. am I being dramatic?
you are the best... but I'm not.. but it's okay...
good luck with your rocket
probably
please do. pretty please?
pinky promise?
well.. please do.... I had an idea for a Mr. Snail with the mail. if you were to write that... sorry.. it's a silly idea. sorry... good luck!!!. bye
well like.. you could start off by naming different types of snails.. and then end with Mr. Snail
Pale Snail, Mail Snail, Crazy Snail, and Lazy Snail. 
Dopy snail and mopy snail. tall snail, small snail. big snail, fig snail (who could like figs). And there's Mr. Snail
And he's off to get the mail
and that's how you could begin it
and then like he could sit on a leaf. and get blown away from the mail. and then have to travel back. and find that it was Sunday
and the mail doesn't get delivered on sunday. anyway, just food for thought
have fun with your rocket. and if you choose to write that as a book, then good luck with that :D. I can help you draw the snails.. unless you've seen mine so many times that you can do it
well if you get time, I'd love to read it one day
unless you write something else
that's good too
that's silly. .... I'm lame. but bye. sigh.. I'm such a waste of time.. goodnight and sweet dreams
that's silly..
you should be sorry..
because you're the lovely one
sorry..
I think sometimes I can't accept that I'm lucky enough to be in your eyes as an amazing guy
no you don't silly.. you're beautiful. and amazing
and fantastical . and cute
and smart. and neat. and just everything
eww.. cherries 
I want to give you a kiss.. . but I ran out of chocolate. which is sad on two different levels
yeah, I don't have chocolate to give you
and I don't have chocolate to pig out on 
what made you smile?. and what gave you a heart attack?
I've got a puzzled look on my face
now you have to kill me.. huh?. because you've said too much
but just this time?
I'm allergic to unicorns. sorry.. for giving you that heart attack
that's crazy... you must be magic to survive them
anyway.. I'm sorry for wasting your time.. I should let you go
you could have been designing rockets!
Spy Snail and fly snail
but I think fly snail is just a butterfly in disguise 
just more ideas for your book :D. ah.. just friend... okay, goodnight, Leandra
sweet dreams. bye
sorry.. goodnight
haha, if you say so. tah tah for now. I'm sorry for just one last thing I think
it's okay. it's just something that was on my mind.. and I think I reminded myself. it starts with a k.. but I'm just going to leave.. so goodnight and sweet dreams. sorry, bye bye
sorry :/
I find that hard to believe... in fact I just don't believe it.... . I just got inside from walking  home.. but I hope you do great with all of the stuff you have to do. thanks for making me feel so "great" today.. 
I'm sorry, but I should go keep being alone.. and you should do your work. I walked home.. right after practice
I saw you get in the car... and I was right next to you..
right.. after practice...
go eat popcorn..
I'm going to continue to feel alone
...
no you wouldn't.. you kept me alone all day. and made me cry the way home
and now..
so just leave me alone.. . because that's how I've felt all day
no, I'm not.. I can't believe you can't tell
I just don't matter.. so go get to your stuff.. and I'm going to cry somewhere else..
I was quiet all day...
it doesn't matter though.. just get to your stuff.. . you could have helped..
but just go and design a rocket. and stop letting me waste your time
no.. just work on your stuff. I'm going to go warm up because I'm freezing..
go have fun.... and I'll just go
I love you too...
but you didn't show it so well today. sorry.... have fun............ without me and such
it's a waste of time
you said Friday once.. and it's Friday today..
so you really should get your work done
yes... get your work done..
because at one point you said that I could see you later today.. but that was a long time ago
what you'd have to say would be important, but you shouldn't waste your time with me... I would... but you have work to do
you didn't do anything wrong
it's my fault... but I haven't felt so great since Tuesday night
I couldn't bike you home.. which made me feel like you didn't want me
I'm sorry :/
you should get on with your friday and do stuffs
truth be told it could easily happen...
if you say so
I'd say you're the only girl.. but I don't want to be cheesy either. you're so busy though.. so I should let you get to work
nope, you're pretty good at it
well good luck
you're a genius, silly
you're the smartest girl I know, so go go go
I'm not that smart..
I should let you get to wrk. work*
I'm none of those things. I'll see you Monday...
I don't think so
It's really fine.. you need to get to work. please get to work?. I'm feeling better
I don't want you to call me.. because you said that we could possibly do something today.. but now you can't. so I just want you to get your work done. I'll go take a really warm shower.. because I'm still cold
it's okay
you're the greatest :3
but please get to work?
please do. because I don't want to not being able to do something with you for nothing
I'm still alone here... I'm sorry.. it's stupid
no.. I'm sorry. you're the bestest friend anyone could ever ask for. but I just feel like you don't want me as a boyfriend. I don't know. but get to work
because I wanted to do something with you today.. and now I'm disappointed that I can't
I just got my hopes up again.. but I'll stop that..
It's you.. so I'm disappointed
It's... okay
I'm just never going to have hopes again
I don't think you know how amazing I think you are..
I'm fine with being alone.... it does though...
:'(
be quiet, Leandra.. you're perfect..
no don't call me. It's my fault that you don't have time for things. so just get to work. I'll shut up and be alone for the rest of the weekend
no matter how much I hoped to see you... :'(
I'll try not to get so disappointed this time..
but I think I really miss you . and I didn't really do much with you today. no fun. shut up
I'm sorry too. I'm not going to have any fun though. quit acting like there's a way for me to. I'm so sorry. so so so sorry. I'm going to go die now... good luck with everything. have an awesome weekend
I feel much worse now :/ and summer is a long ways away.. and I sorta wish it could have just happened today.... I'm sorry for everything :/. goodnight and sweet dreams.. have a nice weekend without me :/
I don't have anything to do over the weekend...
and you never messed up my life..
and I meant that I just wish I could have seen you today... or something
but no.. there isn't
later though.. never mind
I wouldn't have anyone to go with.... so that's a silly suggestion
oh, are you going?
oh well.. have fun.. with both things
I would say yes if you were to ask me.. but I don't really know how to square dance
crazy. you're so busy though.. 
I didn't even know that
they have that too?
well that's crazy
very cool. hey, you should get back to work, I'm sorry for bothering you again
wait up on what?
you're busy tomorrow... I wouldn't be waiting.. I'd just have nothing to do
whoa.. that just sounds.. crazy. I've never cut pineapple before
that's not mutual. you're probably pro now
like dragon fruit?
no.. but it's a cactus 
yeah, I only had it as a drink
I don't know where people bye it. buy*. failure on my part
aww, I couldn't ask you to do that
I know what they look like
aww.. I can't eat rotten dragon fruit
it's a cactus
I don't know. I've never raised one before
yes. sorry for wasting your time
you've got homework to finish
yeah, have fun
nah, that's not me. please stay focused. I'd like to dosey doe with you tomorrow
bye bye cutie pie
it's okay
do I need to rescue you?. sorry... bye I guess. goodnight and sweet dreams
sorry.. for saying that.. goodnight and sweet dreams
good luck! Don't be sorry though :D And you can borrow my camera as much as you like :3 have fun today with everything. cereal sounds good :3
okay, still.. good luck with everything. more and more good luck
awesome :D. Well have fun :3
I mean.. is there any way to have more fun?. I mean, be honest. space- the final frontier 
Exactly
Yeah :D Nothing could be fun
more* fun. and design space probes/rockets. which you should be doing
What are you doing today?
Okay, well go go go then
If that's what will help
I'm giving you an hour. so go go go. If you're not done by that hour.. I'll put on my sad face. maybe more than an hour.. but still. If it needs to be technical take about 15-60 minutes to do research. and the essay should take about 45 minutes. to an hour. so that's like 2 hours per essay. and then you've still got time for designing
does it help with like.. a deadline?
really?. :P
Well if you're done in 4 hours.. then you can get a hug
but if you're not done.. then you have to keep working. and there's no hug :P. yeah, 4 hours for the essays. so good luck. 4:45, so go go go
sad face?
oh no, I didn't think about that stuff
well.. 4:34 is the deadline, but you get until 5 just to round up
and then do the math
and save the quiz for last. because then you'd know everything :D
if you like. just.. make sure not to fall asleep. make some tea or something. you can have food and tea breaks. Just keep like.. a loaf of bread next to you while you write :P
so I'll let you get to work. so go go go go
Okay, good. make sure you don't have any distractions
you gotta be diligent 
haha, just don't go on facebook
if you're on google looking up information, that's good :D
Step 1 make your tea and grab your snacks
Step 2 lock yourself in a room with pencils and paper
Step 3 work
Umm.. Step 4 get done by the deadline 
Step 5 get a hug and congratulations n' what not. I had a dream that it snowed last night
no.. I think it was just all rainy. anyway, go go go.. don't get distracted by me.. I have robotics today from 1-4.. so hopefully we both get done at the same time :D. so call if you feel the need to check up with me. but only if like.. you're stuck or.. you need more motivation. or to tell me how far you've gotten :D
You too!
me too :D
I'm not, but thanks
I'll ask people at robotics about rockets and stuff. while I'm there. okay, bye bye
Deadline now 5:10 because I wasted some of your time
bye bye cutie pie. don't think of it as work.. think of it as something you want to do and it'll be something that you'll get done. and don't forget to have fun
you'll get the most work done if it's fun. just like.. dance and write and learn
if it helps play some music in the background. but not distracting music
just something to fill the silence . exactly :D
Bye, Leandra
good luck :D. Have fun learning about rockets
me? nice? impossible.. tah tah for now :3. bye and try your best, I believe in you. 5:15 (I wasted more of your time)
but remember that deadline is just for the essays
I love you too :3. Do the math when you're ready, you're super smart and the math probably won't take too long.. like.. relatively . And once you're ready go pass that quiz
nothing to thank me for, good luck, Leandra. bye for now :3
:3. Get tah workin' :D. bye (:
Oh, well.. I can always extend the deadline.. since you have been working well. :D
You go this!! :3. got*
haha.. . I knew it was more complicated :P. I just.. I dunno
well, I believe in you
Good luck then (:
You should go go go. goodnight just in case
oh, yeah.. you should eat dinner. robotics was okay.. I was a bit unuseful . oh and if you decide to go, have fun square dancing. I bet you'll be doing circles around those people
they weren't.. they didn't really care. or squares. but umm.. yeah, have fun with everything (:
You've got this. they didn't.. but thanks
that's a good way to think about it :D
it'll just get easier
and no.. but thank you.... good luck
haha, why would you want to do that?. you gotsta work
that sounds silly.. but okay
the phone is all ready and prepped 
Bye bye cutie pie :3. You can make rockets fly. (along with my heart) :P
I love you too :3. bye (:. have fun!!!. I miss you.... sorry, bye
uh uh, you're awesome. yeah, talking you helped a little.. but I still do. sorry... bye. talking to* you :P. sorry. goodnight and sweet dreams, I hope you did really well with finishing everything.. if not then.. you've still got time :D and tomorrow!!!
awesome :D I'm pretty proud of you :3 Good luck with the rest of the stuff (: I think you totally made the deadline (for me), by the way (: you know what that means? :P sorry.. umm, good morning :D and have a great day with those things. (:
Aw I missed you. maybe?. but you've got your work to do. sorry for not being here 12 minutes ago :/. and an hour ago :P. sorry.... I hope it's going really well (: I'd lie if I said I didn't miss you... sorry.. but yeah, I guess... goodnight? and sweet dreams. If you see this later.. you can call me, if you like.. or something.. maybe... if you want to, you probably don't. but good luck with everything.. and sorry
sorry. you don't have to. I was just away. from the computer.. and I see you are also. I keep popping up at the wrong time :/. so I said you could call me.. since I would be away... I wish you weren't so busy. I missed you by 4 minutes both times :/. Sweet dreams :3 I hope you get to fight giants and eat foods in them :D and be the hero in the story!. or something cool (:
aw.. I'm going to miss you :/  and I do now, but that's not the point.. have fun at track and good luck with everything today! I don't suppose you were serious about Tuesday.. but umm.. yeah, I still owe you that thing because you met your deadline.. if you still want it.. I doubt you do
Well it's yours whenever you want to redeem it.. the deadline was sort of just an excuse to hug you.. so I sorta was planning on doing so anyway :D if that's okay..  You're super cute :3 I don't know how you're so cute.. it's crazy... anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams :3
hopefully. see ya
night cutie pie :3. it was okay. but you should go go go. so you can sleep :D
uh uh. bye :3. sweet dreams (:
tah tah for now.. good luck with everything.. I'm sorry that I never gave you that hug that I owed you.. and I'm just sorry for everything.... but have fun and everything. I'm sorry that your mom had to come all that way to pick us up.. I should have stayed and given you a ride home. I'm sorry that I'm not so great too.. I'm not even someone you'd want to hug.. I mean, you don't like my hugs.. and I'm sorry for losing you during the run... I thought you were behind me :/. and I'm just sorry for everything. I suppose it's good that you don't want to.. the "k" word... because I'd probably mess that up too and say sorry over and over. sorry :/. goodnight and sweet dreams.. I'm sorry :'(. I'm sorry.. I'll go try and cheer up on my own.. but thanks for everything (:. goodnight and sweet dreams, and I hope things don't pile up so much. Ignore all of that ^ up there                                                                                                  Goodnight and sweet dreams!! I'm sorry for making you nervous and getting really close to your face and keeping you away from your homework for so long and everything..

I don't deserve you :/ and I don't know why you'd want a mess up like me
I don't even think I have a jersey any more. it crumbled after being so dirty. it's just dust now. so out of your league as in you're better than me
I don't know.. I'm pretty lame
I'm not... and I should let you get to work. and I'll go find something to eat.. because I haven't had the chance to have lunch yet
I'm really not... but thanks... good luck with everything
I ran out of bread..
oh well... thanks anyways. sorry again. bye
I don't think so... bye

I probably ate a clock once too
you twister of words
exactly. he'll probably kill me
nah. well bye though. good luck again. and sweet dreams n' everything. I'm sorry for being such a waste of time and a lamo. but umm.. bye bye
I wish that were true.. good morning anyways! I hope you slept well.. have a nice superbowl sunday
my wish won't come true.. but thanks have fun. sorry. hi. or umm.. sorry. sorry... bye. so sorry
it's okay
I don't mean to bother you. you can just get back to whatever you were doing
still.. I'm sorry. you should get to cool stuff
I don't know about that. doughnuts are pretty delicious 
I didn't know they had some that had words on them. either way, the doughnuts are still better than me
well it kind of sounds like you've got doughnuts
what did you ask for?. Tacos?!?
I wish I could help you with that... but I wouldn't know any guy to do that with you
prbably. probably*
Hello
okay I guess.. I haven't done much. you?
doughnuts help fix creativity. like.. eating some
those don't exist, so you should be okay
unicorns have horns to hold their doughnuts
yup. they do. both are magical and both have rainbows
I'm not magic, so that doesn't really work
what's been said before?
I'm not. but hey, you should go get things done so you can watch football commercials 
it's okay. even if that would be nice. I'd just be in the way
I'm not
well you're silly
hey now.. that doesn't apply here
that's silly
I don't know. either way.. you should be doing better stuff than talking to I
I mean.. stuff that you should be doing
yeah, so you should do that. and enjoy the superbowl
for what?. stuff?
I'm sure you can get stuffs done
I'm sure that you'll get whatever you need done
it's okay. I wouldn't know how to help you out. so I'm sorry. you just can do it though :D. I believe in you
I wish I could help you work. if you're not good at working alone..
and?. and not me.. . I've got nothin'
a nice thing is letting me help you?
I get to help you?
well it's not that good. but it's the least I can offer. or best I can. the least I can do
better food?
no.. wayt. way*
and ice cream!
whoa!!. You'd probably hate it. but I kinda like it
maybe
yeah, right now
oh.. so no?. okay. well I better let you get to your stuff. because I'm not much help. and I'll go be alone n' stuff
not me. but thanks
nope
the extra zing will making it sound like you made a joke. zing
it sounds pretty funny to me
that's so silly. hey, the superbowl starts soon. if you keep wasting your time talking to me. you'll never see the funny commercials 
aw man.. that's sad
yeah I guess. this will be the second time I miss the superbowl with you. oh well
oh.. okay. we could just make a tradition of never seeing each other again too if that's how you feel
or not.. it doesn't matter. I don't really care.. and you obviously don't. I was just making up a reason to see you or something.. but seeing me isn't all that great so.. . talking to me isn't all that great either. so I'm just going to go and be home alone n' stuff. because it's "so great" to be alone
I doubt that... well good luck with everything. I better get out of your way
I'm not so great.. so I shouldn't..
I'm not.. but thanks
not really.... but hey, good luck with stuff. bye
I won't.. but thanks
yeah.. but it doesn't matter. you wouldn't do that.. and you don't have one. so pretty much..
okay... that's a picture
thanks?
it's okay... I'm sorry too
what if.. I kicked a puppy?
http://i.imgur.com/hnmJ1.gif. what if it looked like that?
http://i.imgur.com/RAikm.jpg. what about that one?. http://i.imgur.com/80tG7.jpg. or that one?. I could be one sick puppy. (pun)
I think I would
would you?
I've never had one either. http://cutepuppydog.net/wallpapers/Welsh-Corgi.jpg. are you thinking?
a future with puppies?!?!
nice :3. very cute. you and a puppy would be like.. cute overload. because you're cute and you'd have a puppy and it's too much to imagine o.o
you're right... you're way cuter than a puppy :D
or completely true?
or something that I said. because that's what I think. and it's true!
I'm nothing of the sort
no way
oh okay... I better go... do something. everyone is gone to a superbowl party. so I'm home alone
yeah, oh well
nah, it's scary down there
it's too scary. and you said you had to eat dinner and do stuffs
I dare you not ot. to*
boom
you're gone?. okay.. well bye
I liked the white one :P. but if I had to choose a puppy I don't think I'd really mind much on which one I got
I remember the show
it's crazy. I think there's a new one too
haha. yeah. anyway, go have fun with everything
of course. it would be my honor :3. byebye cutie pie
of course. I love you
I hope so too. so that we can get a puppy and pet it
and poke it in the tummy. and then poke you in the tummy
I doubt that. but I could always test it. and I'm not perfect. I think you are though. have fun with everything and good luck
if you don't want me to tickle you, I won't
okay, goodnight and sweet dreams
but what about being tickled?. is that bad?
oh, okay

it's whatever I come up with
I draw it. and any time. I just don't know what to do 
well a decent amount of time
well I am unlimited with whatever. well anything
I couldn't do that
well it's supposed to be an actual thingy
I guess similar . but I don't think I could do anything like that
yeah. I just don't know where to start. I'm bad with that sort of that thing
I don't have any ideas... :p
I wish I were good with that kind of thing
good?
all three?. or mostly the first two
okay. got it down
haha. umm.. I'll make sketches and ask you what you like tomorrow (:

I thought everyone had to go..
a silly something. It's not too important
I know nothing of iHop
It's at the tech track
yeah, well I guess you weren't planning on going. so I'll probably have to walk over soon
oh it's fine
it's fine.. . It's all out of the way. plus you're probably super busy. and the thing I want to give you is probably not the best idea. sorry
it's not... there isn't much snow anyway for that
oh, okay. I'll head out then
well.. bye then. have fun
you got an email from your couch?. weird..
ah, you're right it looks all cold and windy outside... oh well.. bye... I gotta go now if I want to be able to limp all the way. :P

sorry for not being important
I'll start walking
oh no, I'm sorry.. . ah, I wasn't trying to say that at all
I'm sorry.. now you're making me feel bad :/. I'm sorry :(. I'm a terrible person
I'm going to go now
I'm sorry. It's my fault for having to walk and I was trying to lighten up the idea?
because it doesn't sound like fun
No, it's okay, I'm not important
I know that you don't have time for me, so it's okay... and I can leave that stuff out for you at some point. because I'd still like for you to have it. but I'm sorry :/. ah, I'm an awful person :/
I'm going to go now..
It's not a present for you.. . It's an idea. for a present that you can give someone
yeah, but I'm sorry... I'm so sorry :/
:/
I don't like myself that much.... I'm sorry, I shouldn't ever bother you, I should just leave you or something. because I don't deserve you and I can't make you feel bad and I feel so bad for being a terrible guy. and since you're so busy you wouldn't notice.. so maybe that's the only good thing I can do... I'm sorry :/. ah, I'm sorry.. I can tell by the silence that you're just upset with me or something.. I wish I could so something right :'(
oh, I need to find that..
I'm terrible and I... I should go.. before I say anything else and feel even worse :/
sure.. . wait, no. I can't bother you.. I'm already so much of a bother... I'll just go and find it on the way out. so bye :/. good luck with everything
okay.. I found it. thanks..
vibrate. I hate myself.... I don't feel like talking :/
sorry, I should go. and that's cool..
I guess so
ah, I'm so stupid
nothing's your fault... so don't be sorry. I messed up... you really sounded upset with me..
so I'm sorry
I think you could..
that's not true..
I've got like.. sadness in the pit of my stomach
It's my fault.. . I mess up way to much
I'm not perfect... :/. I should go so I don't bother you any more and so that you can get to your breakfast
bye.. I'll see you Monday
no you wouldn't, because I'm not important.. 
I'm sure you would prefer to eat or talk to someone else
because I'm the worst
you're busy.. . so not ill Monday. until*
what doesn't have to?
if we get snow you just have extra time for homework. but I doubt we'll get snow... so I'll see you Monday
and if we do get snow.. I'll see you whenever we get back
well.. not a lot of snow. I'm up for anything
but you're too busy
the snow won't last that long... and I didn't notice that that was as much snow as we had... and maybe 4 ish.. because I've gotta go to that track meet
wait.. 
you've got a bunch of homework
a not to do what?. note*
it can't wait
so you've gotta do it. I was going to go to the meet and do some of my homework :P
It's a risk you're going to have to take! You're future depends on it
(Back To The Future quote)
Marty said that..
sorry, I'm a nerd.. I should go really fast. don't forget to wish at 11:11
bye.. I'll see you Monday
I think the sun came around.. it might melt it all away
bye.. I'm sorry for everything. how could you like me? I'm terrible. I'm worse than Dorian Gray
well.. I like you too.. but I don't think that's a good thing
me neither
well I forgive you too. and okay, I'll go. have fun with breakfast and bye. It's almost 11:11. 2 minutes in counting
no time for that silly stuff..
I gotta go as is
right well.. I'll be there. bye
11:11. bye
I really really really like you too.... ah, I don't deserve a wish, you can have mine... bye. I'm going :/
well it's too late now.. anyway, I'm sorry.. and I'm going, bye
I love you too, I'm sorry.. it looks like the snow is gone.. so see you Monday. sorry. sorry.. you're obviously busy. I won't bother you any more today..
okay... bye :/. I guess no sledding because there isn't any snow and you just left even though I was still here. well.. that just made me feel worse...
Whoa
Jinx
me too :3
we both got home at the same time. so it was all jinx. :3. I love you (:. and I'm sorry for keeping you out for so long and for saying that so much and for the k thing
but.. hi :3
don't be sorry for those things... especially not for the k word :3. soup in trees?. sounds amazing
oh.. I hope you don't get in trouble
not in big trouble?. does that still mean trouble?
and I'm excited too! :3
and we can have a puppy later on so that we can hug it
yeah! :3
I had a phone, I should have let you use it. yes! :e. :3 *. City of Ember- the movie that will never be finished
one day
You're way more amazing :3
aw, man... you're right
you and your long arm span
haha, it's like that mail room. I liked being with you :3. have fun with your stuffs :3
I'm glad I didn't either. okay, bye bye cutie pie :3. I hope you like the stuffs I gave you. good luck with everything. and I'll try and get you those fabric markers. I also have white fabric paint, not sure how useful that is though
I mean, I find it hard to find all of my stuffs in a small zipper. I think either or
I think making it is more important though. exactly, it's hard to fit your hand inside a small zipper. a big zipper leaves for so many possibilities 
well, maybe not that. but it's good for wishful thinking. :D. anyway, have fun with everything :3. and I'm sure whatever you do will be amazing. byebye cutie pie :3
goodnight and sweet dreams :3
I'm sure it will be :3

you wasted it?. aww..
you should've just called me. and I would have gone and taken it off your hands in no time
yay :3. you're so cute :3. sorry..
So? . it doesn't matter that you didn't do anything. say*. because you're cute anyway . you're always cute :3. and I love you :3. sorry
aw.. well, normal popcorn is good too :D
of course :D. did you get all of your work done and now you're relaxing with a movie and popcorn?
you didn't finish everything but you're still going to watch a movie?
aw.. too bad. if only they were there
I'm sure they would be over there in a heartbeat if you asked 'em. but you should probably do your work and get popcorn butter all over it
exactly :D. so maybe you could save a movie day for a day that you didn't have so much to worry about :D. oh, you could treat your homework like a movie. which would make it entertaining so you'd do it! 
awesome!. so I'll let you get to that. and I'll get out of your way :D. so goodnight and sweet dreams :3
I wish I could watch movies with you :3. but I'm probably not that certain friend of yours. anyway, super sweet dreams and I can't wait to see you tomorrow :3. I love you so much :3. Goodnight (:

I'm sorry.. you're not going to have much time for homework :/ and sorry for running with the car, I just liked seeing you. goodnight and sweet dreams :3.

exactly :D
I think I am
12

That's where I went to school 
Margaret Beeks is probably why you don't know where it is though

okay, have fun
what are you writing about?
well you get an hour and a half then

What are the 4 pillars?

What do you think you'd be doing then. >>*. ?*. How will you be a leader in the community and how will you donate your services? And what kind of person do you expect to be>. ?*
Honestly I think you'd be super nice and willing to help anywhere :D
You could do a mixture of both. haha, jinx. ish
well donating stuff isn't too great because donating your time is like the same
get your future husband to help out too
I'm sure if you marry someone they would want to spend the rest of their life with you, I know I would
sorry.. umm.. but yeah, you wouldn't be a single parent
I'm always around to help out (:. I'll be there for you in 20 years :D
But yeah, I think you've gotta lot of stuff already thought of. (:
You could just volunteer and stuff
not all the time, but contribute a little of your time because that would be significant anyway
Oh there's an option between the two essays?
Oh, well do that! :D. You already do bunches and you have lots of fun n' stuff so you can do this easy peasy 
I know you do :3
well you've got this (:. I like you too :3. Good luck with the essays. and have fun when you go sledding (:

Oh, I bet it'd still be super fun (:. and the weather does speak of snow.. but I doubt it. but yeah, you should go for it
the 25th. I like snow too..
but I haven't played in any

what about your idea?
you sure though?
Because we can try both?
saying mine is simple makes it sound like you think it's not the most intelligent way of building one
oh, aww. we don't have to build it the way I have it designed
we could get a big spring and stuff
tighten it down a bunch and then, boom. it could work
I'm sorry for having a bad idea. anyway, get to your things and goodnight and sweet dreams
the catapult isn't good
aw, but it isn't the best it could be. anyway, I'll let you get to your things and I'll try to remember the most I can about limits and derivative application
oh, I already tried :P. but okay, bye bye . goodnight and sweet dreams
oh, nice. anyway, there are plenty of different catapults that we could go over. so if the one I've got doesn't work then we'll just scratch i. it*
that would be cool :D

Tin Tin is playing at the Alexander Black House tonight!! sorry.. but.. wait, you're probably busy, but I was going to ask if you'd like to see it, but probably not.. sorry.. anyway, have a really nice day n' whatnot (:
I know Ethan too, and you :D so it'd be fine.. oh, and if you can't make it to that movie, then it's okay. I just got home from the meet, so I think I've got time before it's dark outside.. anyway, I hope you had a nice day n' what not
whoa, really?. You'd want to?
well that's crazy
I'm wearing jeans incase it gets a bit colder. also, to save myself from potential bug bites
do whatever you like :D
I'll go find a blanket for us
don't worry, I'll find us one :3
if you wouldn't mind sharing a blanket
really?
I can bring two, if that would make you feel more comfortable
I wouldn't mind at all :3
and okay, pillow and a blanket. I'll find those things and head out as soon as possible
oh!!. I have a large pillow that fits two :D
no, we can share the big one :D. oh, I have some pizza, I can bring some. and food is all yummy :3

I'll be super fast n' what not
I think that would be fine (:
anyway, I'll head out super duper fast. bye bye

If that's the case, goodnight/morning and sweet dreams. I hope you have fun today . aw, I'm sorry :/ I feel all lame . sigh :p I'm so lame... I'm sorry for everything, but I hope you have a nice day tomorrow.. I'll stop bothering you with things. It would have been nice to have seen you more yesterday, but I guess I'm not the best to see :P anyway, have a nice day today, and a nice summer. sorry for that, and for everything.. and for being me, so anyway, I'll stop sending so many messages, and I'll stop bothering you.
never got an unreadable one :D
makes sense. :. :3 *. sorry for everything.. and for missing you and stuff :/
oh, you too.. I'm sorry for not being on facebook
nice? nonsense... I'm sorry for things
sorry
oh, it only lasted for 10 minutes :P. so I'm back now. I hope you had fun with stuff too though
I guess
sorry, you're grounded. I should probably get off of facebook or something
really?. You're mom sounded pretty serious
oh, well it's okay. someone has to enforce your punishment, right?
that sounds terrible..
why are you afraid of that?
what explosion thingy?. sorry... I'm confused. and I don't know anything
well you couldn't though, because you weren't supposed to see me (I was invisible)
well that and you were grounded and not supposed to see me anyway
well I'm sorry for being a bad influence, it's probably my fault
you're not a terrible terrible person. it was very sweet of you, I'll give you that
very silly, but I still think it was sweet
yeah, I'm not sweet
well I'm not. oh, and I'll let you get to your stuff. it sounded important
nothing, actually. what are you up to>. ?*
oh, I hope you have fun for the next week
if you like
art sounds like fun, but so does band. Self defense could be useful?. Etiquette and Manners, no offense, are not useful in todays society (I don't think anyway). I don't know. you should do what you want to do
yeah, that's sort of what I was thinking about that :P
very cool
maybe
well, it's all up to you. so I hope you have fun
it'll be an adventure. so there won't be anything to miss
adventures with me aren't any fun
I'm sorry. anyway, I'll let you get to stuff. so, bye and goodnight and sweet dreams
I'm still sorry

you don't have to, plus you're grounded. and you shouldn't focus on me, so get ready and have fun. and be safe. bye
you can if you like.. just for a second, but you don't have to
I read it, and it was nice (: sorry. you're quite lovely. sorry again:3. sorry :/. sorry, I've just been missing you way too much. I haven't been able to sleep and I haven't been thinking right. It probably sounds silly, and I probably shouldn't feel this way, but I've been feeling pretty empty. I'm sorry for messaging you, and I don't know when you'll get the message (or if you'll even care) sorry.. this probably sounds super cliche and whatnot, it's only been nine days since I've seen you, so I guess I shouldn't feel this way. I'm sorry.                                                     sorry for everything, I hope you had (and I guess continue to have) an amazing time on your thingy

rawrs. Hi
nah. not yet
that's okay!. You can hold onto them. should I take business calc at 6:30pm to 7:45pm?
oh the class is from 6:30 to 7:45
Monday and Wednesday. No Friday
I guess not. I'll sign up for it, but drop it if a better time becomes available
11:00 to 11:50am is a good time
especially since I have a class in WC 225. and the Calc class would be in WC 227
yeah!. I'll see if that class would be available
aren't you always cuddly?
awesome!!
I think so :D
Or you wanted to miss your test!. hmm.
okay.. so I don't think the math class would work at 6:30. because the Graphic class is at the same time, and I'd like to take that one if the room opens up
okay, I'll be on the look out
oh, and. goodnight and sweet dreams!
you gotsta sleeps :D. I gotta too :/. but yeah!

I'm not eating anything :P. Me neither
I wish you could go shopping with me.. but I'm all the way over here. and that's okay, enjoy :D
good luck with that :P
maybe. I'll let you get to important stuff!!. have fun with everything. if I go to bed then I won't be able to think about a rumbly tumbly
!!! who found it?. Someone awesome?. Did they find it a long time ago?. I have about 2 or 3 hat packets :P

I don't know. I stalker?. maybe..
what? not bedhead/workouthead?
nah, I'd like to see it :3. you're cute
I'd be willing to take that risk. plus, that way you can get protein in your system. you're supposed to eat protein and maybe carbs within 20 minutes of your workout. and you better be drinking like.. 2 mancups of water
hey, you need to eat within 20 minutes!. that way the food will be beneficial 
it's super silly
but if that's what you want
I'd probably fall asleep mid-pushup 
no, 'cause I'm sleeeeepsy

Well the poster part is important. but the written part is the most important
Polk is my dads favorite, so that could get you brownie points. If you want to do Roosevelt, I'm sure it would make it onto the wall :D
whoa!. I still can help with the poster part. I like doing that sort of stuff
but everyone else is getting their images from other sources. :3. sorry
yup. I can :D
oh, okay. sorry
Honestly, I thought that images from the internet are pretty much the same as an image from some other source . because if you used a political cartoon, it's like the same thing
It'd be cool :D
Which one would you want to do?. George Robotington

byebye
boop
I forgot my pens still
oh, okay then (:. Would you like to watch Adventure Time and Regular Show with me if you stop by?
cool (:. you're cool
No school means you won't miss anything tomorrow (:
You're cool (:. and I like you :D. I wish that the Super MACC was still on, because I'd like to see it. but I'm glad you're getting extra time for school works
Hello :3
Cold, but okayu. you?
yum. mango is pretty good :3. I heard that MACC was postponed.. I wish I could see you :P
aw :3. I would like to see you on Wednesday
yeah!. You're awesome. It'd be nice of you. but it's okay if you can't
I think Beth would be there that day. maybe
I may have been wrong about Katy though
Katy likes to watch Psych. so maybe if she came home early she could
I'll ask her if she'd be willing to
yeah. you're cool :3
that makes you super cool :3
of course, silly :3
something delicious, but in the middle of being awesome and more awesome?
She likes tiramisu. I know you've made that before... but maybe you can make chocolate tiramisu!. (I'm assuming she likes it because she likes coffee)
I can help!
Well.. I would like to. I don't know when/how
My exam is Thursday. so we could make it on Wednesday
We can bake and study!. :D
cool :#. (:
You're so so so so cool :3. I wrote the conclusion for the thingy. I wrote it during math :P
But I need you to proof read :P. well.. you don't have to
Yay :3 . You're so nice (:
Thank you for being amazing. :3. it looks like it's snowing again
You always are :3. I made my tensegrity project. but I forgot to include 10" rods in one of them. so I'm going to need to make another. but I don't have any more dowels left :P
I guess I'll have to. but it's due Wednesday. I wish I just had some dowels here. I'll look or something
that. doesn't sound like a bad idea!. :3. You'e cute. it's snowing a lot harder than I had expected. it looks like yesterday all over again
I think it stopped. I should be okay. but I've got to go to Physics soonish. I'll talk to you later if you're still here (:. Maybe we can skype or something?
Whoa.. I may need to go to Christiansburg too!. maybe.. I'll see you there. because I need to go to Home Depot for more dowels. wait... never mind... just remembered the lack of.... hmm. never mind again. the dowels were only about a dollar and I have some quarters :P. sorry... I'm silly
crazy. well it'd be neat to see you there. or something
you could be stopping by somewhere else that I could see you though(:. (: *. like.. I don't know.. Walmart, or Michaels, or Regal Cinemas. whole possibilities of places that I might just happen to be also :P. sorry
aww... I guess I wasn't doing a very good job at hinting at something. but okay... bye for now. have a really nice rest of your day
nothing, I was just being silly
oh, well, have fun anyway. It'll be so fun for ya :D
This isn't war. silly :3. I'll let you be a good lil' girl so you might be able to do stuffs on Wednesday. so yeah (:
tah tah for now :3. No, it's like.. hugs and feels nice . war is punches and hurts. or.. hurts and feels bad. anyway, byebye (L:
boop
Andy works there :P. And that's because you're cute. cute people always get extra brownies. like.. right now.. I'm giving you extra brownie points. because you're awesome (:
I never get brownies. because I'm not cute. silly..
yeah, I shouldn't get any of the brownies. so that everyone else can be happy
nuh uh. if Paige and Molly came over for some odd reason on Wednesday, would it be okay if you did too?. I don't think Katy will be able too. unfortunately. to*. sorry. typo :P. sorry... I wish I were better for you
with your tongue?. makes sense. yeah, Paige is on break
I wanna see the picture!
I know, I wanna see it :3
yay (:
Well.. I did it. I had like.. 30 1" dowels cut
and glued them together hoping I could have 3 10" dowels. but they broke because of the rubber bands
haha. you... you. you're cute :3. Well goodnight and sweet dreams. I'll be honest.. you're going to take that power nap and not wake up until it's too late
okay!. okay, well.. you're wake up call has been set
so sleep well
goodnight and sweet dreams. bye for now!
I wasn't good enough though. You were already awake. http://i.imgur.com/p8UvEkt.jpg
Boop di doop. I think I finished the homework, but.. I don't know.. it's probably not done very well
Whoa. you should be sleeping!. http://i.imgur.com/QtAO8um.gif
http://i.imgur.com/gc6wLkX.gif. poke
I'm not adorable. but I dropped yogurt on my pants. so I guess I'm.. 
yogurtable
It's time.. . to.... think... about physics!. do you want to physics with me?
okay (:. I guess.. hmm... the take home test isn't due until Monday. which is kinda neat
Yes, there was
Yeah, Northern Baroque . but it was Southern Flemish . Mostly Peter Paul Rubens. but there was also a woman artist named Peeters. I can't remember her first name. it started with a C though
it was 17th century
yeah. it wasn't so interesting. but she mentioned some portraits, so I took those into account for my story. oh, I gotta go to the orthodontist, so I'll talk to you later
boop
bip bop boop bloop. whoa, did you read the story?. hmm?. that'd be cool if you did
Awesome!. Sorry for calling so often then... I kind of didn't want to walk home alone in the dark. so I wanted to talk to you... but I guess it didn't matter, because I got home anyway. it would have been nice to hear your voice though. sorry. http://i.imgur.com/FZN1eUN.jpg. http://i.imgur.com/cJ8OqSn.jpg. http://i.imgur.com/8zgimVu.gif. boop
bop
boppity
what?. No you didn't. pshh. I liked seeing you today :3. I finished the multiple choice part of the exam, and at least one of the paragraph questions should be easy
that sounds amazing
aw.. but I don't have transportation. I suppose I can walk (:
yay, bikes :3. aw, but giving me a ride is silly. silly. aw, where'd you go?. I'm gonna get ready, but you disappeared :P
should I bring homework to work on? because I haven't finished the take home test yet. but I'm sure I can finish later, because I have an idea as to how to do it. so I guess I can leave it here :P. okay.. well I'm pretty much ready, I'll go walk over or something
oh, makes sense
oh, okay. well I'm ready whenever . and now I suppose
I'll leave my homework here :P. see you soon then,
poke
yum yum yum :3. you make banana bread with a super ripe banana. I think banana pudding too. boop
hello (:
nopes

hey, that's before the 30 minutes
I'm counting it though. just kidding. but it's close
you did. but it's okay (:
boop
koopatroop
you're silly
i saw
if I didn't, would you be sad?
I'll be sure to poke you bunches then
but maybe not so much because I'm eating cereal. nom nom nom
haha, yeah we do :3
Boo Berry
BOOO. oh no. someone sent out a lickitung
ew. he actually stomped on my face though. I like the move mimic. because I could like.. mimic a move and destroy everyone in my path! o.O
:3. You're cute
you'. re* so awesome
okay!. good luck (:. have fun too :D. you're so cool (:
I don't think so, I'm sorry. Hot Hot Heat is a cool band. that I heard on your pandora though
it's good. I just heard it. it sounds like.. murican the strokes. except their Canadian. which.. ya know is in North America. so I suppose I was valid. anyway, bye for now :3
you're awesome :3
nopes. you're the best
hi
that's crazy
crazy cray. you're cool
yeah they are :3. I've been killin' pokemans with my togepi
well.. it was a Gengar and like.. some haunters
so they were already dead
mmmm. toast
haha. I've never met a ghost I didn't like
yups. I actually haven't met any ghosts
would you like to skypee?
so like.. I let my mom in pokemon have some of my money. and like.. she's buying me dolls and stuff I never use. and I'm getting upset that she's buying stuffs :P
no like.. she's just saving it..
and buying stuff for me. so I'm thinking of tellin' my momma to stop
yep. I need that money to buy like.. pokeballs n' stuff
what?. no... so I can... It's manly, okay?
hey
I'm like... man n' stuff
it's okay :3. I'm just joking. but also trying to protect my pokemans. they're like.. all men. except for my ghastly. that's a girl for some reason. you wouldn't want to call my togepi cute. trust me. he beat like.. a gengar that was 6 levels higher than he was. and he like.. beat 2 haunters. all in the same gym battle
Sentret apparently can learn Surf
I never would have guessed. taught slowpoke instead though
me too :P
it's sorta in a scary way
it's dark up there and cold. and scary and alone. sorry for wanting to skypee
maybe. seeing you is always nice :3. we could even fall asleep or something (:
oh well... we don't have to skypee
hmm.. that is the question
boop
I got another gym badge
apparently the gym leader that I just beat was supposed to be really tough
but cindaquil took care of her level 35 steelix. so thank you for the cindaquil
cindaquil is level 31 now
yeah!
well he was good
yeah!. that's the gym leader I beat too!
that's crazy :P. I was told by someone that I needed to watch the Pokemon movie. the first one
would you watch it with me?. maybe?. It'd be nice to watch it with someone
cool
cool!. that'd be neat. I'd like that a lot :3. I like you a lot :3
oh.. so the reason why the motor isn't efficient, is because it is only touching the wire half of the time. so there needs to be a way to fix that. Seeing how Mr. Beaken knows physics, do you think you could ask him, possibly?. Like.. what would fix that problem?
aw, nose. But but... oh yeah.. Mrs. Scales might know about it too
don't tell me she was gone too?. well it'd be nice if you could ask, I've watched a few videos. and I've stopped playing pokemans. because ya know.. I needsta get to work n' stuff. I'm thinking I could try and get a lot of my homework done tonight, so that tomorrow I can start on my term project for art history
neats :3. yeah, I was planning on coming to the art show, but I'm not sure if all the teachers would be around. Oh, I saw a video really similar to that one. that's sort of how I pictured it in my mind though
yeah, that's what I was thinking.. they may or may not leave early
yum
aww.. okay :/. byebye for now. I'm just like.. looking for portraits of women from the 15th century to the 21st century for my book
so I don't think you could really help. aww, that's cute
aw, that's silly. but really nice. but also very silly. you've got other stuff to work on
nah, you don't has enough time
you're silly. but if you want to help, you may. I won't tell you to. but if you do it anyway, it's out of my control
Well I need women portraits painted by men . time spanning from the 1400s (15th century) to the 2000s (21st century)
well.. probably most from Europe. but I'll ask my teacher if I'm allowed to throw in sum merican art as well
and they preferably should have the names of the female in the portrait, because I don't know if I'm allowed to put in a portrait of a female without her name . but again, I'm going to ask my Professor whether or not that would be okay
I have not, but that looks pretty cool. so thank you
you're cool
yeah there is. most of those are Madonnas' (Mary with or without Jesus). so I guess that makes it kinda easy to weed through
nom nom nom :3. I'll let you get to stuffs though. I'll start my physics and calculus homework. byebye for now. and goodnight and sweet dreams for later if I don't say it later :3
I don't know.. I'll find out if I need more portraits when I get there. I'd like to skypee you again tonight, but I suppose I can wait until Fritag to see you again. hehehe. Fritag wasn't spell checked because it's German
yeah, but I did. byebye for now :3
You're amazing :3
Well.. you're amazing at your job :3. and amazing in general :D. sorry for calling so much today
oh, well.. that's okay then. I'm just sorry that I did
oh, ya know. I decided that maybe.. running up and down my stairs would be a good substitute for workin' out outside. and did that for a while
haha. that's just silly. maybe dangerous. but awesome 
haha
okay (:
okay, well.. I'll get on it then
good luck to you :3
hey.. just because someone asks you to do something, doesn't mean you do it. sometimes they ask you to do illegal things
heyyy. you... you're so cool :3. and cute :3
okay. well.. have fun (:. and you're so so cute :3
have fun with pandas. and bambas. and random sambas
ya darn tootn' they rhyme
it's silly to like me, but I like you too
Goodnight and sweet dreams. sorry for sillies. deedle leedle leet
oh nose. I wasn't on facebook. I was waiting on skypee :/. boop doop
bloops. I wish I had a glue stick :/
my project is due tomorrow, and there weren't when I was there. teachers don't have supplies. it's expected that the student have them :P. I just.. I really didn't think about it over the weekend. I thought I had one here.. but I was wrong
I guess. it feels like such a waste of gas though. I'll spend more on gas than it costs to buy the glue stick :P
I don't have a bike light. so I couldn't go far. I probably couldn't go anywhere
I don't have flour
and you need glue too. I don't even have bottle glue or tacky glue. I have my brothers good wood glue
and I have Katy's spray adhesive, but her spray adhesive doesn't work very quickly. and it's my brothers GOOD wood glue
Okay.. Bye then. sorry for wasting your time with my glue stick problem
I'm sorry for being lame. I'm not sure I want to drive very far for just a glue stick
so I'll just stay home. I'm so lame. so I'm sorry. bye
Where?
That sounds like a sketchy place is it's that close :P. if*
I don't think they're open. Which makes sense I suppose. thanks anyways. I'll stop wasting your time though
that's what it sounds like. but it's probably not open either. these local businesses close early, usually
yeah. I don't really know any of them
You sure?. The college students on this street scare me. and I don't even live next to any college students . they are a few blocks down
closes at 7:30
It's okay. I'm sorry for not having a glue stick already
I guess that's a good point
It's at 10
It's okay.. I don't think I could make what I was planning to make within the time I have now. It was going to be fairly complicated. I have a new idea that may work though. and I don't think it'll need glue. and if it does, I can always show up early to class tomorrow and hope that there may be glue waiting for me
like I said.. I don't think I would have enough time to do it. It's okay. I shouldn't have forgotten my glue stick in Blacksburg. I left like.. 2 there. I'm sorry for being lame
I'm so lame
we could.. skypee!?. I can skype and do stuffs
and if you're there... you can make sure that I do my stuffs :3
it's like.. a win win :3. except for you. you'd have to see me :P
nah
that's crazy talk!
Boop. :3. sorry
Hey now
are you pokin' me?. You're what dreams are made of :3
just a hunch
well.. I guess you're the dream and dreamy part :3. you're dreamy, ya know ^_^
I think of you when I think of dreamy. because you're often in my dreams. and I just get all... ya know. around you ;3. :3 *
yeah :3. I can't wait until tomorrow. I still have a lot to do for my term project. but ya know. I did a good amount of studying for tomorrow
awesome. I just killed a baby spider
I knew it was a baby, because they particular spider grows to be much larger than it was. it was crawling on my bed and startled me
it grows to like.. the size of your palm
I don't think it's deadly.. but ya know. oh, yeah..
Studying sounds like so much fun :3
http://neomam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tumblr_mkbn6qZUy61s667kio2_500.png. wait. don't read that yet. read this first. http://neomam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tumblr_mkbn6qZUy61s667kio1_500.png

http://i.imgur.com/pQT96Ln.jpg. You might like that too. but I don't know if I've already sent it to you 
I recall sending it to someone. possibly. a long time ago
who knows
hmmm. Hummmmmm
why are you talkin' about bums?
oh. sorry. sorry to offend you, Leandra. I'll let you get to your humbums then
it did
yups. Tomorrow is so soon!
!. Cool
you're cool
I'll agree with physics.. and you. but not me
I doubt that
I guess so. if you can o.O
it might just be
I think so :3. Especially with you. n' stuffs. :D
aww, a cute genie
boop
Oh, I'm not :P
I wouldn't go to sleep without calling you first
moop
Bop
I like u2. Not the band, of course
it was supposed to be like. R2 U2. even though it's not D2
cool. you're cool :3
I know.. that you're cool :3
nothing on Friday. you were right :3. Time to learn.. dun dun. art history. or.. prepare for, I mean
well.. one was for 3d art. so ya know... so like.. 2 down. the math one wasn't so bad, even though I woke up at like.. 9:15 with my exam at 10:15
I wish I could've been there to wake me up too. I'm not so great
Because you're perfect :3. I like you so so so much (:
You're so so so so so so so so so so so so so perfect
tah tah for now (:. I think the highest of you. good luck with everything you do
byebye. Off to art history. then.. maybe some physics, who knows
haha. you're silly
hello
pretty sure it's in the job description
the cookie job?. I'd like it.. as long as you could be there too. anyway.. lots of things to do. I lost a physics notecard, so I need to make a new one of those. and art history stuffs. I'm lost on the art history though, so I'll probably take a break and just do physics or something. I don't know :P. sorry
neat!!. I could help you study, seeing how summer is just a day away
neat (L:
that'd be crazy. and so nice. I think, for the time being, I am skyping with Cody. because he lives all away in Ohio. but I would love to skype later
:3. Hyo. I made my physics notecards. I'm a bit sleepy as well though. http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/
Only if you'd want me there. floop
neat :3
boop
whoa!. what's so cute?
because their so delicious?
cool :D. that sounds delicious :D
macaroni salad?. Like the kind my family makes?. My family just like.. gets some macaroni elbows n' add mayo n' vegies. vegies include tomatos and bell peppers. and maybe some cucumbers 
yeah. simplicity . I have ritz crackers here.. and I was thinking that they'd be a good little snack for tomorrow for you. if you wanted them
I guess that would make sense. you sound like you're going to have the bestest day tomorrow
what?. nah.. that wouldn't make your day the bestest. just make my day the bestest
What?. not for you though, I'm lame
that sounds like an awesome to do list. but your todo list is lacking in puppies. I have book glue if that would repair your textbooks at all. anyway, though, I should let you get to stuff if you gotsta finish it tonight
so crazy. I should still let you get to it. if you want to sleeps too. sleeps is importanto 
Me neither. you could call Paige maybe. and ask her how it's done
I don't think so. she came home n' stuffs. and I'd say she should be able to talk to you
yeah (:
hmmmmm. hum hum dum. brum. I can't wait to illustrate that book for you :P
yay!!. It'll be cool (:. I should let you keep on getting to things though
oh, neat
awesome
that sounds. that sounds.... awesome!!! :D
yes (:. You're awesome enough to... hang out with. I'm not sure if I'd want to eat you though. it's debatable . just kidding :P. what time would you like to wake up in the morning?
Hey. that's the time I set for my alarm. I'm not even kidding. I set it for that time specifically for you :D
Nah, there's so much more to learn about you
What? Me? I'm an open book. with magic. but other than that.. a book. plain and simple
or maybe, the ending was given a long time ago, but since forgotten 
well neither of us are elephants, now are we?
what? I find that hard to believe. J-3. that's an elephant face. J;3. or that one. :P
the J is the nose, the - is the eye and the 3 is the ear
yeah!
you're awesome 9. I'm feeling a lil' sleepy, so I may go to bed soon. so goodnight and sweet dreams :3
that'd be awesome (:. good luck with everything. byebye for now. you're cute :3. bye
Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. You're the best of the best :3
of course :D. if you'd like me to help. I'd love to
oh, neat. that sounds like so much fun!. I'll be there!!. It sounds so cool. I'll go ahead and get to sleep n' stuffs. so goodnight and sweet dreams. I'll try to be there the earliest that I can be

I do not, do you?. It's so soupy outside
earth soup. okay, well... if you say so . I guess I'll let you get to it then!. No sense in letting me waste your time
I don't think I would classify it as fun, but who knows.. it could get better. byebye for now. I hope you have a super fun day!
so cold I bet
nothing like soup

I'm sorry

unfortunately I am me all the time. anyway, I'll finish messing with that photo that you wanted . and I'll let you finish with the concrete
you wanted a photo of me?. I was messing with the photo of you
maybe
I was supposed to teach you
but I was going to make it just in case
I'm not so great
byebye. sorry for being lame. okay, done
yes
it didn't take too long. so it's just available for if you don't finish the one that you work on in time. so whenever you want to learn or be taught or anything.. I'm available
of course. I'm always free. and available. and things
that's okay. It's just bad that I'm your favorite guy
that's okay too. I'm just not so great. I'm not good enough to be your favorite guy
that's silly. I'm not so great
if you would like, you're always welcome
you're very nice (:
That's silly. I'm a wee bit thirsty. I wish I had like.. some capris . I mean.. caprisun. pants aren't going to make me less thirsty :P
yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I was just trying to make that pants joke
what?. I do that? that's crazy
yay :D. then my plan is working!
to make you smile :3. and to make you happy. and to be yours. if you'd want me. sorry

I only want to play on that server as long as you're there too
byebye for now. boop
Hi
boop
hello
I'm okay, how are you?
awesome! :D. a neat thing about minecraft is.. . is that there are desert and jungle temples. and you can excavate them and find treasure!. :P
yup. they're pretty rare.. but it's exciting for whenever you do find them. Also there are villages too. and you can find little villagers to trade with you. n' stuff. or you can loot their village and burn it to the ground. the choice is yours
what does it sound like?
Kinda. there are children

I think that there should be limitations on abortion. there was a woman who had like.. 20 abortions because she wanted to keep her figure, but she died on her last one. because her body couldn't handle it
That sounds good
I feel like so many people abuse it though. so I don't know..
Yeah, from what I've heard though. I guess that isn't a reliable source
But if someone didn't want a baby, they shouldn't have "tried" to. the exception would be for rape
?. that was.. a little disturbing

so I assumed what it assumed and I chose what it thought I wouldn't choose
and boom
I had to take a few falls in order to understand what the computer was thinking, but after that I got like.. 5 wins in a row. well that's for novice, I used the expert version of the game. 7.  Professionals are predictable, it's the amateurs that are      dangerous.. that sums up how I was playing rock paper scissors. http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/2tBuD9/:1iWEZ2smz:KGUxKZ$Q/www.howsweeteats.com/2012/03/chocolate-chip-cookie-dough-peanut-butter-cups/. sorry..

Hmm.. there is this yardsale in north carolina selling n64 games for 25 cents each
http://winstonsalem.craigslist.org/vgm/4015005452.html. I talked them down to $20 I think
I told them I lived a bit away. a few hours. (2 hours). But he wants it gone tonight. so I don't know
Then that comes out to like.. 30 ish dollars. so I dunno
yeah
He wants it out of the house by tonight, there was a yardsale selling games for cheap in North Carolina, but I can't find the ad anymore
that's crazy. Yeah.. I suppose I shouldn't do that. might be better off finding someone at a yardsale like last time
They sell for 25-30 I think. A guy is willing to sell me 2 for $35
Bye for now :3
Good morning :D. Hello :3. How are you?

Hello
Hi. How are you?
Oh ya know. setting up my imaginary yoga mat
I'm really looking around for n64 a/v cables and conrollers
Me too. It might be easiest to find them at a yard sale. well.. maybe not easiest. but most affordable
yeah, but he didn't get a/v cables. which is why I'm looking
Well.. no. But people have reviews online that the new ones break really easily
or don't work after a while, whereas the original have worked since they were made
Doubtful, but who knows. If there were, they'd probably sell them for expensives. I just remembered to order textbooks, which is bad. it's mostly because I had most of the ones I needed already. the only problem was that.. One of the items I needed kept the same price, however the other doubled in price. Which I didn't know would happen, but I suppose I shouldn't have waited like I big dumb dumb
It's not your job to remind me
The textbook is 90 dollars now. when it was 41
I know. I had two options. I get a "package" which was $120 or so. or get a $40 book. but then the price changed. and made me sad
It's specific to radford. 9780558808860. but there it is. Amazon is still $40. for the book. so that's good. I suppose I should just order there. I know it's not $20, but ya know
well thanks
English. Core
http://greenville.craigslist.org/vgm/4019031617.html. They're willing to ship the controller. is that too crazy?
That's what I was thinking. kinda
okay!
HMMMMM. hmm. humnomnom. hmm (scratches chin)
go go go . When does your mom need me to mow the lawn?
okay
nah
Of course :3. Keep up the good work :D  
I know . scary. Are yours tomorrow too?
Crazy!!
Graphic Design, stop motion, mythology, and English

I'm silly though. http://charlottesville.craigslist.org/vgm/3937409491.html. http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/vgm/4024628713.html. they have controllers. and are kinda in the Charlottesville area
wish or will?
I suppose the other is in D.C.
oh
It was okay

that sounds awesome. I wish I could find av cables
which isn't important. it's just.. ya know. yeah, I've got a week to surprise him
because he's going to ohio. he may or may not find them. but maybe if I do, it'd be cool. I need to get him 3. so it's going to be crazy, because I don't even think I'll be able to find 1
Well.. knowing him, he'd probably want to pay me back. so I wouldn't want him to have to buy super expensive ones. I think I'd like them for $3 each. or less. maybe more
mine?. or find?
I'm sorry :(. Who knew that you wouldn't find one?. Are there goodwills in Charlottesville?
Awesome!. I've been checking them out for a/v cables. but no luck so far. yardsales are a next bet. anyway, how's your day been?
Well.. nothing much has happened since I talked to you. I guess it's been alright. I'm just a lil'.. it's been okay
That would be aweosme. awesome*. I need to order that book and pack. mostly pack. packing would be a good thing to do
yup. maybe. Just need some clothes n' things

Hello
It's me. And it's you. too. also. as well. Hello (:
Well you must be mistaken, I'm Peter. But I've been okay, how have you been?
Whoa!. You've decided that?. That'd be crazy!!
You can always learn more about the people you live with now. by stalking them!. just kidding :P
Oh no!. What are you missing? Can I help?
Oh, well people aren't really hard to find. But I'll try to help find whoever you're looking for
What kind of pictures, silly?
hey now.. don't be silly, silly-head :3
Nothing much. I could play pokemon silver!. Which is crazy :P
but my gameboy died :P
I got a charger, no worries . umm
Todadile, cyndaquil, and chikorita?. I don't know how to spell any of them. My gameboy died when I tried to choose one of them
Pokemon Crystal is on my zune I think. and Yellow. not Silver!! o.o. I don't know. which would you pick?
Yay!. I was going to pick him (:
You're adorable
nah, that title is reserved for you. when is your fall break again?
crazy. that gives you time for other things!. Like.. I'm not saying you'd want to, but if you stayed with me during that time. until the 15th would be enough time for you to forget about me
I guess that makes sense
I don't know. to get me "out of your system" so you can do school things
you're silly :3
oh nose. I'm pretty tired myself
but I may have to call you on skypee later
if you wake up to the call, then awesome (:
I'm going to go eat a snack and then brush my teeth. byebye for now. :3

I just needed more information on the Frogs by Aristophanes. But it's okay
Oh, it's okay. thanks though
I was given a list. but it's fine, unless you wanted the list
1)	A brief description of the play 2)	Who wrote it? A brief bio of the author. 3)	When and where was it first performed? 4)	What was the political situation when it was written? 5)	How was it received when first performed? 6)	What does it tell us about Greek culture/society/morality/etcetera? 7)	What later plays/operas/books/paintings/movies/etcetera have been based on it? . that's my list. but feel free to ignore it. I've found a few websites. Hey! Don't forget to eat!!
Jacob Higgins: Hey Miss Irvine, does that offer for a guitar string still stand?

Oh!. Awesome!! (:. I hope you have bunches of fun
Talking with Eneas, but I'll get some work done soon . I gotta pick a topic for my English paper
Just did, but he was going to sleep. So I'm not sure if he'd see it until later
It is! It's for an argument :P. It's gotta be on a "controversial law"
Not really. but I'll think of something. byebye for now

Hmm.. That's quite the conundrum you have going for yourself right there. Perhaps one of us must see if we can write the most verbose of paragraphs and see if we can see if this may happen, whether it may or not, it may be interesting to see what could come out as an effect to the cause. I'm not saying that this is silly, but it may be, perhaps, the most random string of letters and words that I have ever had the chance to string together. Blah Blah Blah. I think you are super duper wonderful and cute. I love you, Leandra. Oh, and also, I made the batter for some banana bread, but I didn't have an egg, so it's just chillin' in the fridge. Yup, my chatbox is like.. supes weird yo. :P
Oh! Banana bread because those bananas I saved you turned nasty black
Yeah, but now I'm going to save you Banana Bread!
I may have mixed strawberries into the batter 
mmmm
pears are so good :D
AAAHHH. so good!. I like.. need the fruits in my mouth right meow
no.. but I do! :3
yum nom nom. I had a strawberry and avocado smoothie last night :P 
It was okay. Like.. the avocado was barely noticeable and I added cinnamon . and it was good
don't worry, Leandra. I readeded the label first (:

I'll do that!. Tah tah for now!. I get sad separating something from its home (the gamecube from the a/v and controllers) but I suppose it will be okay. It's a weird sentimental thing though, and I'll get over it
No it doesn't! It sounds crazy

I was missing you too!. quiz and comp are today. my comp isn't very good, but I got some stuff on the computer. and the power point needs to get done. so I think I'm doing "okay"
probably. but my class is at 6pm
so if it's really bad.. then they may cancel night classes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PvBc2TOpE4#t=126. do you have a snow day?
whoa. crazy!
You're nice. and magic!. :3. Look at all this snow. it's actually here :P. it must be God's plan for me to miss school today. just kidding :P
But classes don't cancel easily. it's true
I drove in the snow, and look at where I am now!. Not dead. I'd say it's not that tough :P. just kidding :P. I'm dead. zombiefied
I've done that too. but I understand. it's just.. really hard for Radford to cancel for anything. Apparently it was a big deal, and they made make up days. none of my teachers held make up days, but it was an option
and we've had 10 snow days in the history of ever. (give or take)
hehe. you're silly. .,. .,. .,. .,.
mhmm :P. You're amazing!
not true
You're magic!. yes it's true
What would you say in person? :P
I don't know. Can't always trust pie. charts. just kidding. I trust you and your pie
is it going to make me work off the calories from the pie?
ellipticals are scary
I'm sorry for bad jokes all the time
You're perfect!
mhmm :3
I think about you all the time and how perfect you are. no.... I want to talk to you more. and I'm eating food

Good afternoon@. !*. I mean... night!
Hello!. again!
Sorry for losing you so often :(. Mooop
Soup!
I forgot my retainer, so don't throw it away please.
Thank you!
Hello!
How are you???
I am good as well.. Hello.
Hello.. Sorry.
Good morning.. How are you?
We can camp if you still want to.. I am okay.
But yesterday we watched a movie and bought clothing.
I have some super glue you can use.. I only got it for one reason, but then again, I may have used it all.. But you can have it and buy some more at Wal-mart.. Are we returning the clothes I bought yesterday from Old Navy?. Because I don't have to wear them.
Why?. I thought we were going to wait to find other ones.
I do not, but I can ask him.
He's at work.. So I'd have to call him.. Or text and hope that he answers.. But I can try and find the cans first?. I'm not sure if they'd be in the truck or not.
He probably bought it from Advance Auto though.
I tried and lost.. Awesome!. I'll see if we have any primer.
I would, but I'm not ready if we need to go now.
How long are you giving me?
Well I can try to work to the time you set me. That way I have someone to disappoint if I produce failure.
Yes.. Okay!. Hello!. I love you so very much, Leandra Irvine. There isn't a time or day that I do not think of you. How could I not? You're beauty and grace captivates even the most bitter of hearts. Do not change the way you are, as that would be the end of such a wonderful thing.   -That guy you know.
Hello.
Hi.. You have a library video game due today.
I had tried to call you, but I didn't reach you.. I was going to say: "This is a friendly reminder from your public library for *Leandra Irvine*. She has a book due today. Thank you"
Just an idea.. Never saw the light of day.
How are you?
I'm alright.
om nom pizza. Om nom!!!!!. Hello.. om nom. H'lo!
Hello!. How are you?
I'm good too!. (:
(:
(: :)
( :. I love you!. I'm so awesome!. No! You're awesome!. Don't know what came over me.. Might've been you and your awesome.. Or a sneaky Leandra.. Hey!. Stop talking to me through me!. Okay!
:P
Hello!. Good morning!
Hey.. You're the cutie!
I love you too!!
^~^. Hi!
It's me!. And it's you too!
Night night!. Hi, Hi!
Yay!. Hi!. How's it going?
See you there.. Boop!
Hello!
How are you?
I am eating an apple. So good for me.
Tomorrow is discount day! :P
Awesome!. Quiz me on early printing presses!. just kidding, I'm sure you are busy!
Money!. :P. A bunch of people were trying to develop a printing press because they knew that it would save on costs.. Since paper and hand writing was an expensive and long process, the thought of reducing the cost and time it took to produce intrigued many.. That probably won't help me much though :P
http://www.profgracie.com/uploads/4/2/8/9/4289993/meggs4estudyguide.pdf
By being able to mass produce something that would have taken months to make would have impacts on politics and the church.. The first thing they actually started printing (or one of the first things) were decks of playing cards.. You could quiz me from that, if you have time.
It's the process of printing where a relief is carved into a piece of wood or metal (copper) that then has ink applied to it and then transferred to paper.. Maybe?
copperplate printing is a relief process I think.
I don't know. I just recall that it was sticky enough to adhere to the pages without leaking and making a mess.. I hope he doesn't ask any questions about the other chapters. He said Chapter five, but could that mean it up to chapter five?
We have not.
I don't think he's going to worry about the first couple of chapters.
Because it's mostly background to written language, and not about Graphic Design.
He said "Make sure to read Chapter 5, we'll have a quiz Monday"
You're pretty!. clear... :P. !
I took the quiz.. I got three of them incorrect.. I didn't do any of the matching, as I did not have the images handy right at the moment.. But I also don't think we're getting that in depth with the images.
Yup.
(")>. <("). There we go.
Yay!. You're awesome!

Om nom!. Have fun!
Me too!
tah tah for now.. Hi!
Cool!. I have the exam soon!
Thanks!. poke!
Poke back! The Sequel!

Hello, you.
How's it going?
You're not really talking to me though :P. (I mean that due to the lack of actual conversation)
But the few words that you give me are nice.. Boop.. Never mind.
Hi.. Hi hi.
How are you?
I'm holding on.. http://img.sparknotes.com/content/sparklife/sparktalk/hangingcat_Large.jpg

Hello!
Hi!. You're on skype, but not talking :P
Om nom!. Did you eat the brownies first?

Should I have cookie dough ready for you?. Or ice cream>. ?*. Or cookie dough ice cream?
Okay!. We can go shopping together and you can get everything that you'd like (:
Hoo-Zah!. Yay!. You!
I know! :P. Or at least I figured.. Hello!!
You're leaving so soon?. Such a sad tale.. Tah tah for now.
Hello.
How's it going?
That's good.
Wow.. It seems like it would have been perfect to have stayed with you.. I'm okay.. I woke up because of a sad dream, but I'm okay.
It was silly.. You just had another boyfriend.. And although I knew it wasn't true, my heart couldn't tell.
Anyway.. I would talk on skype, but you aren't there!
But with the way the day is going you should skip all the classes!. I stuck $20 in your running shoes.
Just to give it to you (:. Okay!. Well I'm glad the days been going slowly for you.
I will stop bothering you then.. I hope you have a nice day.
Well it's pretty sad so far.
I can't stop thinking about it.. And you seemed so sad when you left to go inside last night.
Don't get your hopes up too high.
Just kinda high?
Well I see a ride leaving Blacksburg on the 31st.. Hello!. Have you checked your notifications recently?
See anything new?
No... It may have to do with your timeline?. Sorry.. Hi hi
How are you?
Boop.. Thank you!. Hello!
How's everything?
Everything is nice, talking to you!
Hi hi!
How's it going?
That's good!. And you're good too!
Sounds more like you!
But that's just me being silly and trying to give you a bunch of compliments.. Sorry for typing.
I could try.. How's your day so far?
That's good!. I'm glad that you are doing everything that you want to do!!
Are you sure you would want to be?
You would definitely like me more if I changed everything about me.
You mean that you like Yugi?
Cool.. Sorry.
For just saying "Cool.". It left the conversation in a stagnant place.
It slowed the conversation to a halt. I would not classify it as amazing.
Exactly. It is not longer a conversation. Or.. it's merely a conversation with yourself-- and no one likes those.
Mhmm!. It's just sad!. So sad :(. Sad to be the only one talking in a conversation, don't you agree, Peter?. Oh, yes. It's the worst spectacle to spectate.
Oh, so me talking with myself is the problem and it's sad for you.
Oh. So we're not having a conversation?. Got it.
Some people can talk about nothing though.
And this does not matter to you then.
I can try to be more substantial to you.
You were the greatest.. Boop.
That's good. I hope to be the highlight of many more.. Hello.
I will try to be good company.
No, that would be Oliver.. Hello.
I've got street savoire faire
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5I3tTxV5h8. boop.. doop.
Sorry for "bopping" so often.
Then I should bop more often-- but that seems like a silly thing to show "care".. Soup boop.. Doop.
What brings you here?
For when we go home on Tuesday?
Would you like my help?
I'm sure you have.. In no way was I doubting your good eyes.. or the quality of them.
:P. Boop. Bop. Boop boop!
I never thought the day would come that you would respond to my boops.
I am but a lowly potato in this vast garden, my dear squash.
Courageous? What did I, a potato, do to earn such a title?
That's just account of me being a runt potato.. Nobody wants to eat me.. I guess I'll talk to you later?. You haven't said anything about seeing me later, so I'll assume you're spending the New Year with your friends. Have fun.
Well thanks!. BooP!. Hello!. Are you still perusing the ride boards?
Oh, you don't have to. I was just starting conversation :P. Have fun!. I'll leave you to it.
:P. My tablet came in.. I'm not very good at using it, but it's really cool.. You could help me practice by giving me stuff to draw :P
Jennifer Tran on Hoo's Driving, but her departure is at 11.
I figured that it wouldn't work.. Everyone seems to be looking for rides going to Tech since classes begin the 20th.
However, the issue then would be returning to Charlottesville.. You should not come unless you are sure you have a ride back.
But she could be going back to Tech?
Oh! I wasn't sure.. Then that could work!. Hello!
How's it going?. You're bacj!. back*. Never mind...
I hadn't seen many listings either. I'd assume because school just started and not many feel the need to leave just yet.. But it's fine. If you don't find a ride, I can wait until some other weekend.
Not if you can't find a ride.
There's always spring break.. Unless you have plans already.
Okay! Enjoy your dinner.. Boop.
Yes!. You sure?
After I finish reading this!. Let me know when you're ready.
Oh... I think you know.
No... Silly!. I finished that already.
Think sillier.
It's gotten pretty intense!
I don't know yet!!. There's a half-brother and he's complicated things!
Okay!. Hello!. How are you?
I'm good! I'm doing well too though.. :P
You got me!. We make sleeping noises together.

Hi Leandra, thanks for letting me know that you wanted the post I made removed. I took it down.
Hi Leandra, thanks for the quick response to my quick response. I frequent my posts and their complaints and I attend to them when they catch someones attention.
Hi Leandra, I love you so much too, and I'm right next to you o.o
Heyy!

Okay.

You had a dream of a talking cat?
That's sad that it wouldn't let you hug it.

You're cute!
Hello.
How are you?
Sitting in an ice cube waiting for it to turn into a car.. I get a surprisingly good internet connection out here.
It could be that. I'm actually in a car covered in ice. I couldn't find anything to scrape it off, unfortunately.. Hello!. Hello.. Hi.
How are you?. Oh, be safe and warm.
Boop/. .*. Hello.. Sorry.. I saw the green circle, and was hopeful.
That's okay.. Hello.
You've got this!
And by "this" I mean *points to self*
Just kidding! I mean you've got studying!
Thanks!. I thought you were spamming me!. It was an invasion of the bodysnatchers type of deal.. But then I saw the "$1.00 Amazon Gift Card" and knew it was you.
I unliked that photo just so I could like it again!
Also, you seem to be focusing more on me, than on your studies!. You better get to it!
I love you!
I like that you're thinking about me.. or at least looking at stuff on my wall.. It's a ball of cat!
When you should be doing "20 minutes of hardcore nonstop studying". Quoted from you.
That's what I heard... :P. Either way, you're not doing what you said you'd be doing!. And you've only got 3 minutes. So get to it!. Or I'll take the "I'm proud of you" back!. And I don't want to do it... but drastic times call for drastic measures.
Tah tah for now!. Boop!. Boop!. Oops.. I shouldn't say boop so often without a response.. Hello.
How are you today>. ?*
I'm good. I know. I om nommed one of them and it was like! Whoa!
Any time.
Pstt..
Oh you pstt first.
So what did you need?
And chocolate?
What if it's dark chocolate?
But you can have both!
Of course.
I'm glad you think so.
That sounds nice.
Hello!
How are you>. ?*
I'm okay too. Which song should I make a website for?. Also, what are you up to?
Whoa! We're both working on websites!. Imagine that?. No questionmark, bad questionmark!
Oh, I meant. At the same time.. We're both working on websites at the same time, and that's just neat.
(:. The song is really cool and it would be neat making boats!. But I think it would also be a lengthy project.
I was thinking the latter and it would have waves and it would look like paper and have textures and what?
Oh? I was thinking of making maps and boats and the likes!. Maybe have charts roll out onto the page.. Might be neat.. I think I would make it a parallax scrolling site, but scrolling upward.
Yes.. I was hoping to make it look like the boat is rocking.
And waves waving.
Yeah!. You'll have to help me with the scenery.
But yeah! The way you imagine the scenery would be neat.
Hmm.. Okay.
What do you mean?. The way I imagine it? I was thinking you knew the song better than I.
I did.
It was alright.
I also made more chicken fried rice.. He said I sounded better since last we met.
I share based on what he asks.
The fried egg.. I think.. It's not deep fried or anything.. It's just cooked, and tastes like fried rice, but I'm uncertain whether it is or not.
I boiled it and the cooked it in a skillet in coconut oil.. then*. Along with carrots and sweet peppers.
Mhmm.. I'm going to walk home now.. Bye for now.. I want to talk to you!
Hello!. I made corrections to the lyrics on the website.
What's wrong?
Om nom!. I believe it is "fast as". Unless he says "vast" twice.
That one was tough.
vastness sounds the best.. But I think it's fast as.. vast as?. That was the one I had the most trouble with.
I listened to his version, and it seems like it's a mixture of both lyrics together.. versions* together.
I think {} means that they thought it was either one.
perhapness.
Yeah! What were they doing? :P
An unabridged version?. It wouldn't make sense, because that stanza just repeated what he already said.
He said that one by one new tracks were in the snow.
Until he was the only one left.
Well I listened to it more.. Like I said, before I had listened to it once.
That means one by one the crew left him.. But he would not leave his Annabel Lee, until he burned his world.. So that he could have warmth. And he won't call it rescue, because he wanted to stay with his Annabel Lee.
Which means, his crew came back for him, but it didn't help him.. It only drove him to "to drink and decline"
Mhmm.
I assumed it was his crew, but you're right. It could be anyone.
It's good to talk about the song if I'm going to make a website on it.. You're going to sleep??. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
Oh? Just leaving me then?
I'll do my best. I may have to work on it at school though, as CS6 has less features than CC.
"Creative Suite 6" and "Creative Cloud"
I have the CS6 version of Muse.. (But I might not have gotten it)
I had CC under a trial, but the trial has run out.
Mhmm! I can still plan it out and make stuff in photoshop.
I like you having me too.. And I like being in your life.. And I can't wait for the weekend.. (I can, but I think it will be fun)
Sweet dreams, you!
Good morning!
You too!. How well did you sleep?. I've gotta start walking, but feel free to call.
It's a bit rainy, but still okay!. Oh man! If only I knew where a Ben & Jerry's was!
The gas may equate to the price of the ice cream.. Perhaps not, but I knew of that one!
(hug)(hug). No! You can ladder in Facebook!. Stair*
Yes. Sorry.
Good!. What angle should I position the ships?
Hmm.. Difficult decision!. I think it would be easiest to make a simple ship from the side.
I need to find fonts.. I was thinking a maritime calligraphic font, but what do you think?
I'm having trouble finding the perfect font.
I'm sure you are busy, but that would be nice. I think I'll ask Paul if he could possibly create one. I'm pretty sure he could do it really quickly too.. (only if he is okay with it, of course.). http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=Jacob+Riley&q=Go. I like this font, but it's $35.
I know.. I'm sorry.
I downloaded JSL Ancient, which looks pretty close.. Thank you.
I love you too!
When are you walking home?
Aww. I would have hoped to walk with you.
No, that's fine!. I've drawn the ships!!. I'll send you some pictures.
Hello.. Grocery store time.
And I sent you the four ships I drew.
Any suggestions on food products?
(I don't really need suggestions, as I, for the most part, know what I'm getting)
(but I'd like to hear what you think). (I care about your inputs, and I care about you in general)
:3. I'll go then?
I'm back.. !!!!!. You can go to the International Street Fair if you get a ride!!. (:. You can go with me! :3. Did you want me to do a Robin Williams impression because of a buzzfeed?
Oh.. I wanted to invite you, but you weren't going to be in Blacksburg.. I don't have to be a third wheel.
You are ideal though!. And I wouldn't mind spending the time with the two of you plus whoever else will be in the group.
(hug)(hug). It removed my spaces! So I couldn't trick the system!
Sweet dreams, Leandra.. Let me know how turning in turns out!
I love you.
!!!!!1. Oop! I didn't expect that.
Night night!. Cutie pie!
Good morning!
Hello!. I miss you. I haven't heard from you for so long!
Hello!. That's good!. Really good!. Has your day been eventful?
Tell me about it! (if you wish to)
Is it a secret?. Is it something you can only tell me in person?
Sounds like fun. I won't bother you if you are busy though.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. Sometimes I feel taken for granted.
You don't have to be sad.
You're too busy to talk. Goodnight.
Good morning, Leandra.
Rhinos in general are in danger! Several species are already extinct!
And there are no rhino stickers to communicate.. Not that we need those, but I was hoping.. Are there any children's books that you are particularly fond of?
The Little House doesn't fit the criteria for the assignment, but sounds neat.
I'm not sure.. I think Matilda would be cool.
Yeah!. Anything else?
What does that mean>. ?*. The books need a character
I need to pick a children's book that has a main "human" character.
So I was asking, but okay.. Goodnight for later.
Asking about children's books.
That is what I was implying.
Thanks.
Good luck with what you have to work on today.
Goodnight for later.. Sweet dreams!
I developed all of the photos I wanted to develop, and I didn't waste any paper (but some of them had spots that I failed to clean off) and I've been making a font.. I've just been doing homework for the most part.. What have you been up to?
Good luck on the test!
I won't keep you from that.. (The studying)
Kind of like this
Paul drew the font for me.. He said "I don't mind, I like drawing letters."
So I spent a good while making it into a usable font.
I'll think about it!
Have you never heard that before?
How do you treat those people?
And if you taught them how to get to the answer, then they would be able to eat fish?
I don't think they will appreciate that.
They did not, unfortunately, but I appreciate that you would go out of your way to help me.
Me too.. Maybe less so.. But still :P
I think you're good at a lot of things.
You're an expert at being able to do a lot of things.
Dun dun!. Like a starburst!. It's chewy like a solid, but juicy like a liquid.
I mean... a Scottish Korean is pretty crazy!
Only for things that aren't very important.. Or information that lacks in usefulness.
Perhaps.. Goodnight and sweet dreams.
You disappeared, so I thought that I'd never see you again.. My laptop also died, but you know.
I apologize. I suppose I also assumed that you would be going to sleep at a reasonable hour.
Are you going to sleep now?
What are you doing instead?. You don't have to tell me.. Sorry for not being the best in your life.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. I'll actually be going to sleep.. Bye.
Good morning.
How did you sleep?
I think I slept well as well.
That's fine.. Have fun.
!!!!
You look good!
Then send me a picture!. I know you look good, even though I haven't seen you. A picture would only confirm my suspicions.
When are you coming to Blacksburg?
Not today?. And that's a great picture!
:/. I shouldn't have gotten so hopeful then.
Tah tah for now.. I looked forward to seeing you.
You can juggle pretty well!. And you play guitar-- and you're learning to play to mandolin.. You like to cook in the microwave, but I've seen you on a stove once or twice.. You like to make things-- could be anything, as long as you're using your hands. (You fixed your shelf and everything!). You like new things-- or at least new experiences. You find enjoyment in new experiences, because they break routine, but experiences in general are nice, because it's something you can remember. (Who needs knick knacks when you have memories?). To add to that, you are very willing to try a new experience (unless you know for certain it is detrimental to your health in any way-- but even then, you want to go skydiving!). What are these fun facts for? You can totally come up with them on your own!. I haven't even broken the surface of "Leandra"!
That really doesn't say anything about you, only about the cousin!. "Driving is the most dangerous everyday activity you participate in.". A police officer said that.. I think talking about your family members may be "fun fact" worthy.. What are the fun facts for?
One thing to describe the undescribable?. That's impossible!
It's more common to have stage fright, but I would say it's about in the middle.
Dry humor consists of jokes that are presented in a bland fashion.
"This delivery is also called dry humor or dry wit, when the intent, but not the presentation, is humorous, blunt, oblique, sarcastic, laconic, or apparently unintentional."
It just means that the presenter is not presenting the joke as a joke.. It's supposed to be funny, but they just say it.. Some say that I have a humor so dry it could be considered a desert.
Sort of. He's not the best example.
Sorry for not responding well!. I think you've got quite the list!
They're all neat!. I think the 12 hours on sims is good though :P
The one you just sent me :P
I have your UVa headshot.
I have one with you in a blue dress. It's really good!
It's a large file.. I should probably make it smaller.
I sent it to you at the full size, but I can make another
It's really good!. I'm missing an art show that I was supposed to go to.
I've been doing homework, and I'm talking to you.
No.. I lost track of time, and realized that I was missing it.. And it seemed like you needed me.
This is a nice photo.
I have a folder with images of you, but I can't seem to find the ones you are looking for.
Okay.. Sorry for not being any help.
I apologize.
To share with whom?
And I haven't finished all of my homework.. Just say something interesting that no one else will say.
Why not a fishing pole? Or a knife? Or a sporf? or a swiss army knife?
Oh, I see it now.. You're very clever!. Silly!
I think the dessert island one is good!
That's good too.
And Peter gets shut down.
Dessert island is clever.
That's not what smart aleck means, but okay.
You're also very judgmental when it comes to me.
I would say you were being more of a "smart aleck"
I'm sorry then.
I was letting you know that that wasn't the correct term to use, but it wasn't a big enough deal to explain the actual definition, however, I see now, that my saying that was not necessary.
But geese are the worst.
It's what comes to mind.
That sounds useful for when you're talking to people of importance or in business related scenarios.. Or for when giving a presentation.. But also to people who you are not the most familiar with.. Which doesn't make me feel nice, but it's not about me.
Sorry for making you feel bad.
I'm not sure. Why can't you?. Have you grown so different that it's difficult? Is it because you don't spend enough time with me?. It's okay to say that you don't like me anymore.
I was excited to go to the festival with you.
I am not who you want.
I've heard good things about them-- like they are really good live.
So if you were to see a band live, they would be one of the ones to see.. Is he the one with the instruction book?
Wow.. Well it sounds like a great concert, but if it's expensive, I do not have to go.. I've been meaning to ask. Would you like to set up a savings account with me?
A joint savings account.
The adventure fund could be generating interest.
I'm not sure! I think it might be half that, but I can add more.. I have $165 that I can add.. (It's in check form, so I'll need to cash it first.. )*
I think it'll be around $800-900 if I add some though.. If I were to sit my grandmother a few more times, I could have more too.. Where would you like to hold the account?
Sounds good! Can I transfer the funds to your account?. Like.. perhaps I could get the money counted at the bank to get an exact amount.
Then I can transfer it to your account.
Sounds good.
Sounds a little stereotypical, but I'm glad you settled on something.
Those things that are "unimportant" are your fun facts. They make up you and the history of you-- it's how you are who you are now.. To dismiss that is terrible.. I think you've decided on something that says less about yourself, than the rest of your "fun facts".
They won't know you from "I dream of exploring the world and helping others."
Because most others will have a similar thought.. You've said nothing that is unique to yourself.
You don't have a mission to go on, you're giving a "fun fact".
People will likely find "Oh, that's not a very fun fact.". Don't come up with something "just for laughs." Just come up with a genuine fun fact, rather than something everyone else is thinking already.
Those are fun facts.. Those quirks make up who you are.
Well "I dream of exploring the world and helping others." sounds boring, and I know you're so much more than that.
You took pride in that statement?. I understand it's something you want to do, but it's very "cookie cutter".
You're not going to excite others to act differently, if that's your intent.. They may feel that "This isn't a fun fact" and dismiss you altogether.
Saying something like "I built a game where you stack dinosaurs on top of a whale." tells people "I'm fun and awesome!"
A fun fact isn't supposed to do anything but let people get a glimpse of who you are.. It's supposed to be playful.
Well. I believe what you are doing is unconventional, but I also do not think it is very useful.
What merit would what have?. You can go ahead and do what you want.. I won't stop you.
It would do nothing, but make you unhappy.
That's fine.
I don't know.
Someone who wants to talk to me and makes time for me.. Someone who wants me to be in there life and shows how much they care.. their*
I want someone who doesn't make me feel alone.. And I don't want someone who obsesses over their ex-boyfriend.
I can just hold onto the adventure fund for until we can deposit it together.
I want a girlfriend who can have fun and won't be so serious all the time.
A lot of them, actually.
You fit a lot of my wants, but you fit what I don't want, because those are specifically catered to you.
No there aren't.. But I know that you want something else, regardless of what you may say.. http://www.thelittleprince.com/the-little-prince-movie-trailer-in-english/
It's just a trailer.
I thought you may be excited for the animation, but I understand that you may wish to read it first.
Of course.. The movie came out in French in 2014, and will come out in English in December.. Goodnight and sweet dreams. You are my only one, I am sorry for treating you poorly today.
I am not.
I just brushed my teeth.
That's good. Does this mean it's time for cartoons?. Just kidding. I'm glad you finished.
I love you.. :/
oops! I didn't mean to click that one.
Turtle!!!. It's my favorite now!
This one's pretty good too, but I think I'll forever use the turtle!. Did you know that you are.... ?. I got the order wrong. I should stop with stickers.
I thought that I could write a sentence and then add the sticker at the end, but it posted the sticker before I sent the sentence.
Good!. Maybe you'd like to watch it with me?
Neat.
That's good.
Okay. Good luck. Sweet dreams.
Good morning.
So violent!
Did you punch anyone in the face?
That's a silly power!
You should right this story, and make it super dramatic, but it would be funny because of the circumstances.
Okay.. Sounds like a wild ride.
I think there was adventure, and some plot twists, but I cannot remember it very vividly.
Like in Tangled?
I was talking to her, your dream stinks.. (from the movie)
They said "Make your dream come true" and then Flynn says "Thank you, I will!" "Not you, I was talking to her. Your dream stinks."
How was it?
Hmm, perhaps!. Time for the movie!
Awesome!
I did, thank you.
Yes, many thanks!. What was the total again?
Okay, I'll be sure to pay you back.. Is there anything else you want as payment?. Like.. interest?
I guess I'll round up then.. I was hoping you'd ask for hugs, but that's fine too.
Okay.. I'll let you get to your day.
But I'm sure you have more to get to.
But you always do.
Is he talking to the fox, or is the fox talking to him?
That's nice.
For the most part I should be doing homework.. For yourself?
Sound very eventful. If Charlottesville is anything like Blacksbburg, then I am sure your walk will be enjoyable.
I have no one to go with.
People I have asked are busy, and I do not like being alone.
I would much rather spend time with you.. But I understand that you don't have those feelings towards me.
I'm always alone, and you tend to make me feel like you'd rather be alone.. So maybe I should just let you be alone.
I do not choose to be alone.
I try to talk to you and other people, but I don't have many close friends that I can spend time with.
I'd rather spend more time with you.
The right people are hard to come by.
I probably shouldn't have you then.
It's too late in the semester to join any clubs. I meet many people, but Radford does not have many people I would like to know better.. The people I meet at events are too rowdy,. .*
They are quieter at the art shows and plays because they're supposed to be.
I already have the "pen pal relationship" with you.
I'm done.
It makes me feel unwanted by you.
The more time I spend with others, the less I can give to you.
You don't need me, and from what you've done, you make me feel unwanted.
That still sounds like you don't need me.. But I understand.
You don't like who I am.. And you question most of my ideas.
You don't find me humorous, and you do not like many of my graphic design projects.
I am very replaceable.
You tried to replace me when you went to Boston.. Or I was the replacement, and I was not satisfying enough.
What would have happened to me if you recovered that something?. I take it personally, because I thought you wouldn't do something like that.
Friends do not kiss or cuddle.
He's much better than I. A perfect SAT score, goes to Harvard, probably as articulate as one can be.. He's everything you want.
Maybe I'm finding reasons for you to leave.
I think it's a little different from spilled milk.
That's not funny.
Not really.
I would say that you took me for granted. You left me feeling undesirable.
You're going to do it again.
Really?
You want to do it again?. With someone else?. Okay.
I hope to get nothing. Nothing is all I was to you, and nothing is what I will continue to be. From you, I will have nothing, but that's fine, I do not need anything. I will not be your everything, as he has come to pass, and you will not be mine.
Hello.
Oh.. Sweet dreams.. Goodnight.
Good morning!. I hope you slept well.
I'm okay.
What do you mean? Are you asking whether or not I'm happy or sad? Or if I'm tired and/or hungry?
I'm feeling sleepy, but that's about it.. I wish I got to see my girlfriend more, but what can ya do?
I would. Would you be busy?
Great.
Happy Earth Day!. How are you celebrating?
I took that photo and I tried not to step on any bugs.
I think so.. I don't usually though.
Good morning.. Hello.. I'm sorry.
What are you sorry for?
It's something to be sad about.
You're really cute.
You make me happier than Pusheen eating a cookie.
Look!. I found you.
Yeah, but if you're eating.... Then it's very similar.
Have you done your groceries?
I haven't gone yet, but I will later.. They have Matilda on Youtube.. We should watch it some time.
It's in HD too!. I have it on VHS, though.. I think you have it on DVD somewhere.
Boop!. Hello!
Hi.. Hello,
How are you?
I'm okay.. Bop.
How goes studying?. And how was the exam?. Poke.. Hello!
i!H. How are you???
I'm glad too.
Hello.
I'm sure I didn't have that great of an affect on your day.
If you say so.. I would say goodnight, but it's the morning, so good morning.
Sleep well.
I love you too.. Hello.
Okay.. Hello.
Yay!. Me too
Thank you (:
Well I'll try and pick you up around 6.
Awesome!. Do you have a gps?. I can probably figure it out without one.
Okay. We can always go by my grandmothers house. I think Paige left the GPS in her car.
Okay!
Of course!
It's fine! (:. I can still drive you!
Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I'll see you bright and early.
Sweet dreams, Gorgeous!
Hello!
I can be!. Were you going to sleep?
Where are you?
Wow!. Hello!
How are you?. Are you still on the road and somehow around wifi?. Or have you made it home safely?
Awesome!. I'm pretty sure there's wifi on the train.. At least there was for the train I was on.
And I missed out on you?
That's good then!
Sounds like fun!
Definitely!. I hope that you do.
Would you like to be my "plus one" to my little sisters graduation party?
I'm alright, how are you?
2307 San Marcos Street at 3 pm to 7 pm.
The page says "Feel free to bring your family or a plus one!". So you are welcome.
I believe that it's somewhere in Blacksburg, but I am also unfamiliar with the location.
Well I'm already family, so I can invite a plus one.. So you can feel free to bring your family.
You're still my plus one either way :P
:/. I never thought rejection would hurt this much.. You are allowed to go, but I will accept your "No Thanks". San Marcos is off of Price's Fork.
The host is one of Molly and Ana's friends, I believe a neighbor of Ana.. I think when I asked Paige she told me it was Betsy Loeschen.. (She only said "Betsy", but that's the only Betsy in the invite list). Good morning.
I put your phone in your baggie, in case you were looking for it.
Hello.. How are you?
I'm not sure which one he uses.. omnigap@gmail.com was one of them, but let me ask him.
oh, it's at yahoo!. but he said that he checks pisarnpk@vt.edu
Of course
I'm working on it.
Have a nice lunch.
You shouldn't make plans with me before you know whether or not you're doing something after lunch.
I won't hold you to that.
I will be ready for 2pm, but I won't go until you tell me you're ready.
It does not say it's closed.
Good morning!. How are you, Pumpkin?
I miss the cuddles, but other than that, I am good too!
me too!!!
I love you!
(:. You should think about coming back for more cuddles :P. Just kidding, I can't ask you to have your "whole day gone."
Good luck!. I have your bear necklace held hostage!
So you better pay up for it back!
I accept Cuddle One and Master Cuddle cards.
:3
You're so cute!. Have a nice time packing!. Don't forget anything!
You're so cute!
Sure, what kind?
Sounds awesome!. When will we go?
Okay! I don't believe I do.
Okay!. Thanks!
Sounds good!. Any luck?
I figured, otherwise you wouldn't still be calling :P
Mhmm! :P
No! You can do this! Don't give up!
!!!. A great pen?. That's awesome!
I'd love to see it some time.. Do you still need to get ready before we g?. go*
No post office trip?
Oh!. Well when should I expect you?
With you? Of course!
I can bring my gamestop gift card.. What should I work on?
Not yet.. Hold on.. Some time before 5 in the afternoon.
No, but it's after my dad gets home, so between 3 to 5.. That's plenty of time to spend with you.
Mhmm!
(hug)(hug). Wait.. :P. That doesn't work.
Awww :(
All this time I thought it was a staircase!. When do you plan to leave?
Okay!
No, that's okay (:. I wouldn't have anyone else hold it :P
Good luck packing!
I had some top secret plans.
It's okay if you do.. But I'll try to impress you.
Well... I had some ideas that I was going to write down.
Mhmm!. There's like.. string holding it up.
Wow!. I don't think I'll use it, but thanks!
Like a hamster!. I mean.. guinea pig :P
Time to code!
Okay :P. Time to pack, then!
You can do it!
Of course I do!
Me too.
Oh, not with me anymore?. Well have fun!
Oh, that's okay. I can't be much fun.. Plus I'd be in the way of your sister bonding :P
Tah tah for now.. I'm going soon.. See you on the other side.. I'm back.. Hello!
I love you too!!!!
It's me!. And it's you!
Awesome!. I hope you have the most fun!. Were there any complications?
Oh, it just had said it had a pack of the adaptors.
I love you too!. (hug)(hug)
You're the bestest!. Bye, Leandra!
bye!
Good morning to you!. Happy Thursday! (:. The trash services did not run yet, so I will check again tonight.
I love you too, Leandra!. I've made sure your bins were put back, but I forgot to check the mail today!. It sounds like a whole lot of fun! Especially with puppies!. Sweet dreams!. Good morning! I hope you slept well!. Good morning!
I ate the sausage and other foods you gave me!. Thanks!
It was really good!
Hello!
It's you too!. You're up at a reasonable time!
!!!
That's so cool!. I think a crocodile is less pointy?. No, they are more pointy!
You've gotta steal one!. Just kidding :P. A waddling crocodile sounds cuter than any other adjective.. Enjoy8 your dinner! Goodnight and sweet dreams for later (:. I love you!
You sound cute! :3
I love you too!
Please do!. But don't miss any moments!. Tah tah for now!
Same with the monkeys here.. Except those are babies.. Also human.
So you say!. But then they getcha!. I'm mostly kidding.
Have a good time!
I hope you have a fantastic end to an already fantastic day!. But I will try to make the most out of what I've got.. Bye for now!
Sweet dreams!. I love you, Leandra.
Puppy!!!. Wow is the dog named Brandy too?
Common name for Russel Terriers then!. Jack*
I've been spending time with Paige.. I think we're going to make Milk Shakes :P. (hug)(hug). The beach sounds like fun!!
I hope you do too!. Better rest up :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Aye Aye
:3. I love you so much!. Sleep well!
Good morning!. I hope you have a wonderful day!
The gopro should be fun over at the beach!
!!. Awesome!. Have the best time until the next day!
Tah tah for now, lovely!
Goodnight for later!. Thanks for keeping me posted like a note!
Goodnight and sweet dreams! I love you too, Leandra!
Good morning!. You're up early!
Well I guess that would do it!
(hug)(hug). *attacked*
:P
What is that?
:3
My day was alright.. We had church this morning and it was a rememberance service.. Then we came home and I chatted with Gap and Cody.. But the day is not over just yet, so there's still room to fill things into it.
How'd you sleep?
We were remembering the people who help in the church and we were remembering those who have passed away.
That's awesome!. I'll try to be comfier for you when you get back.
Don't worry. I'll do better!
Like a rare candy in pokemon?
It's funny that we both thought of Pokemon.
!!!!. That sounds awesome!
You're a treat!
So obviously I want you the most.
I think you should try all of them :P. And then you'll know which one is the bestest.
Oh, you're sweet enough as is!. You don't even have to bring me any, you can just eat them all!
Find a mirror then!. (and look into it, because you're something nice!)
That's me1. Oh! I thought that Pusheen was just blushing :P
:$
What? They make them thinner than .5?!?!
Is it fragile though?
I think .5 is a good medium.. Really?. That's awesome!. I do like good pencils (::. That's so thoughtful of you!!!
Wow that's awesome!
I don't know. I liked the aluminium pencil that I had that was made by Parker.. Actually, it might have been stainless steel.. Aluminium can warp.
The pencil I found in UVa is a Caran d Ache, but it's Swiss made.. Probably even harder to find!. Don't worry too much about it though, I'm just glad you're thinking about me.
Enjoy the sunrise!. I'm sure it's almost as gorgeous as you are.. Have a great day!
(hug)(hug)
I love you so so so so so so so much too!
You too!. Are you going to the beach today?
Awesome!. I hope you have fun!
Be sure to bring your sunblock.
Awesome!. Have the best time!
Bye for now!
Bye, Lovely!
Some of these are silly :P
I think it's a hamcat.
I know :P
That's you!. I mean.. You're not a large pink dragon, but you're so cute!
That's you too!. Enjoy the sunrise!
I'll do my best!. Thank you for talking to me (::
:3. Hi, Cutie!
I love you too!!. How was swimming?. Have you even gone yet?
That's awesome!. Just stay the whole day!
Thanks! It's a love ninja.
Oh, I meant stay at the buffet!
I know.. Oh, I think you might be right about the panda.. Or it's a bear at least.
Om nom!. That sounds amazing.
You also sound amazing..
You can call me in the morning!
I'm running errands tommorrow.. And watering flowers.
Of course!
I did that Thursday.
Of course!
This is me right now.
I'll get you pictures as soon as I take some.
Yawn.
Pictures of you would be great!
You don't have to, but I wouold appreciate them.. That looks like a squid.. Aw, look at that cutie!. (Not the squid thing, but you!
Is that a squid?
Neat!
(hug)(hug)
Thank you!. I'll try to have cool dreams!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Hi!. (hug)(hug)
I love you too!!!
Thanks! It has you in it (:
Yeah, but that's not the highlight of the photo!
And you!. How was the water?
Wow!. That sounds awesome!!
And how were the fish?
That's me!!
Oh, and how was snorkeling?
Wow!. :P. I laughed out loud, just to let you know.
I thought that was cute :3
I want to make a game with you.
I'm not sure actually, I just want to make one.
What do you have in mind?. I think Curse of the Werekitten could be interesting!. You would have to morph into a cat and solve different problems.
I'm not sure whether or not make it so that you have that power and you can change between human and cat at will, or to make it so that there are certain times that you are a cat and certain times that you are a human.. to* make it
Yeah. Something to consider.. I was thinking a story-type game is the type I would like to make.. But hey! You should just tell me of your day.. Or sleep.. Either or!
It was pretty comfortable.
I hope you sleep well!. Oh, it was about the same amount of comfy.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Have another awesome day tomorrow.
I love you too, Cutie Pie!
I didn't make those, but I should start making my own stickers!
Night night!. Good morning!
How was your sleep? Have any nice dreams?
For now!
That sounds nice (:
I watered all of the plants that I could find.. There was one of the biggest strawberries ever in the patch (even bigger than store bought) and it was so good!
Oh no! I missed the one in the bathroom!
I'll go back tomorrow.
It rained today, so I didn't do anything outside.
It's actually been raining a good amount since you've left.. So that's good.
I love you too!!
So good for plants!. And it washed the strawberry that I ate :P. It was so good!
I bit into it and it was like "This is a good strawberry" but then it hit me with this burst of crazy amazing tastes.
But yeah, I watered the plants by the rear door and the ones behind the couch.. I'll go back for the one in the bathroom.
I had difficulty finding where everything goes dish-wise, but I think I did okay.. Anything else I should do at your house?
Everyone is getting plenty of mail.
Except for you, you've only received one or two things.. Oh, I was putting the dishes away while I was there.
But I couldn't remember where everything goes.
I love you too!!. Of course!. You've got such a big day ahead of you!
Thank you.. Big day of relaxing?
Is exploration relaxing?
I'm sure there's a ton to see out there in Langkawi.
Maybe the scenery can inspire your app creation.. Have a great day!!. Tah tah for now!. I love you!
*ninja*
Goodnight and sweet dreams!
Good morning!. I love you too!. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1goWnw6Aar4. I hope you had an amazing day today.
If you want one!!!. I can have it ready for you when you get back (:
A cake shaped like Pusheen :P. I love you so much too!
(hug)(hug)
I am going to help with wedding related projects and I need to somehow find my W2 form.. I think my replacement laptop charger is to come today as well.
I could not find it online. I'm going to contact Student Accounts at Radford University.. That's a cool squirrel!
:3. That sounds nice!
I can see the monkey now!. Sorry to have been so blind!
Awesome!
Thank you (:. Have a wonderful sleep tonight!
No.. that's you!
Oops! I sent it twice :P
Wow! I've never seen those ones before!. You're so cute!. Goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra!. Thank you for talking to me (:
I always am!
I'm just me.
:$. :3. You're great!. And to list the same attributes would sound redundant, so I should leave it at that.. My lovely, huggable, Cutie Pie.
I love you! Goodnight (:
Sweet night dreams!
Tah tah for now!. Good morning!
I love you!. How did you sleep?
That's okay! You're worth it :P. Oh my goodness!. So happy!
What sticker is that? Melting ice cream?
It looks more like a flame?. Or fireball?
Definitely some sort of goo.. Puppy!!. The charger game in the mail today!
!!. I want to do that (:
came* in the mail.. I'm skeptical, but it seems to be charging my laptop :P
I'm worried that the same thing will happen to this charger. There are items on the market that help prevent the wires from fraying, but I'm not sure if it's worth the effort applying them to the charger.
It did not.. Or.. not very well. I hear a spring is the "go to" method.
What I found was a product called "Fray Fix" which involves summoning dark spirits and a few toothpicks in order to prevent wires from fraying.. That's not true :P. Except you are supposed to use toothpicks.
I'm not sure. It's another 14 or so dollars, which isn't bad if it works well.. It just seems like it's more trouble to get on (and you have to cut it off to get it off). Anyway, my day was okay.
Oh, that's your personal collection!. The video I watched about it recommends taking one out of a mechanical pen.
I'm not sure how well it works though!. And I've only ever seen it done on the part closest to the computer.. But the part closest to the charger is the part that frays most often (for me at least)
These ones are great!
Betrayal!. The ham is being betrayed :(. Oh wait!. I meant a sad face.. And this cat looks pretty sad, even though he/she is eating a fish.
As mine are for you!. I'm pretty sure I forgot some at your house, so you won't even need to see me to get them.
It only goes up to 99, silly!. Or over 9000, which is a Dragon Ball Z reference I don't understand very well.
Oh, umm..
The Mother 4 team is looking for spriters and developers to help on the game.
I sent them my portfolio, but we'll see if anything happens.. Oh no! Did they fly into your room?
Oh! Where to now?. Wait. Don't tell me.. Off to Hong Kong!. Awesome.. The itinerary was a bit difficult to decipher, but I gotcha!
Good luck! (:. Aw man! I was incorrect then!
Aw man, I was looking way too far down.. You don't leave until Friday.. That's me.. A silly puppy.
Come on, Peter...
Bye for now, Leandra! Have sweet day dreams :3
Bye, Lovely!
Goodnight and sweet dreams for later!
Hello, sleepyhead!. Is it time for a belly rub?
Gotta get over here then :P
I'm sure it is!. It's okay if you don't. They will be waiting!
Sure!
My day will consist of packing an mowing lawns for the most part.. How was your day?
We're going on a trip to Harrisonburg after the wedding.
It is Saturday!
Thursday!
It's Thursday for me.. It's almost Friday for you.. But I've got half a day before I get there.. You time-traveler, you.
Sounds like something a time-traveler would say!. So you want to play "draw something"?. Or is it draw my thing?
Okay!. Do you know where I can find it?
How'd they sneak in there!. Those sneaky typos.. It looks like an extra 'o' was trying to sneak into your 'good', but you caught it in the act!. and the 'E' in 'enough' was so shocked it fainted and landed on its side!
But hey, such is life.
That's fine. I'll toss clothes into a bag and call it a day.. :P. (hug)(hug)
Snacks sound good!. You sound good too, of course!
I wish I could!. Just kidding.. If I did I wouldn't be able to have you nap on me in the car!!. Not that you would. Only if you wanted to.. You have the option available!
Wow!. Everyone is in the bed?. That's amazing!. It's like the entire island is a bed!
Om nom!. Oh wait... those are pearls.
I thought it was a funny thing eating marshmallows, but it's really just a clam.. oyster*. mollusk*
That's me.. General Generalization.
I might have to promote you to Chief, Pineapple.
How are you to save the planet when you are serving under a General?. You need flexibility to save the world.. I'll just *turns away* keep you grounded... when you need to soar!
You will always be my sweet Pineapple.. But you need space to spread your wings.
You're right. You're a higher up now, and I should respect that, Ms. Chief Mischief.. They can't call me that.. That's my cousin over in Wisconsin.. Except he runs a General Motors, and the name "General Generosity" is a pitch to sell cars.. But still, he owns the trademark.
Wow, it's gotten late, hasn't it?. I should let you sleep, Chief Misch--- Who am I kidding? Sweet dreams, Pineapple!. (I'll stop being silly now!). Goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra!
I love you too, Leandra!
Tah tah for now, Cutie!. Good morning!!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. I love you, Pineapple!!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaOMz711qQM
It's pretty great! (:. How were your dreams?
It was just like! *slowly grabs something with hand*
How was business then?
Yesterday I mostly mowed lawns.. I mowed your yard and I was almost done, but then Scott swooped in with his giant mower and got the rest.. I also got your mail, finished some dishes that were in your sink.. I ate some of your apples, but a lot of your fruit went bad, so that's unfortunate.. I cleaned out your mailbox-- not well, unfortunately, but I tried to get the earwigs out.. I also helped Scott clean out your gutters.. Right now I'm folding.. And packing.
I communicated purely with stickers!. This is the future :P. But it's not a problem helping!
(hug)(hug). I love you (:. The perfect sequence for the perfect girl?. So much rain!. You left for vacation at a perfect time :P. Because the house doesn't get too hot.
Oh, definitely going there!
I should let you sleep!. Sleepyhead! (:. Ohh!!!. I found my bottle cap pin :3
Underneath the middle couch cushion!. And I finished packing!. My bag is super filled, but I have to pack three articles of outer clothing instead of one or two.
Who are you cuddling?
Oh, I have undershirts, dress shirts, and pants!. But maybe that's a bit much.. Goodnight!. Good morning!
It will be at Hollins University in Roanoke.. Thanks, Cutie Pie@!
Of course!. That's a silly sticker!. Goodnight and sweet dreams though!
I love you too!. Aww :3. I'm in Harrisonburg!. Good morning!!!. That's my final form!
You look great!!!!. I love you too!. Is that the gopro?. You look amazing!. So gorgeous!!!. :3. I'm in Harrisonburg, and we're having family fun times!. But you look like you're having the best time of your life!. Sorry I missed out on saying goodnight, but good morning!
Goodnight to you too!. I love you, Leandra.
!!!. Goodnight, Cutie!!!
It's me!. There internet isn't so great though!. The*. Typo's! They've struck again!
Aw man... even in the typos there are typo's.. (that one was on purpose)
I went on a walk with the family. We played some games on the Wii and right now I'm sitting with my dad and he's watching the "news".. It's a rerun of the nightly show.
Harrisonburg.. It's where Massanutten is.
The waterpark is something.. You liked it, right?
Yeah! Tjeu. They*'ve'd improved the outside portion of the park.
So that'll be something I haven't been to.. We haven't gone yet.. We've only been here for a day.. I was just informed that it was improved.
That's fine!. Have fun :3
Have sweet dreams!!. I love you!
It was National Best Friend Day yesterday (today for me)! So happy Best Friend Day, best friend!
I'll save you the cake for when you are back!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. Good morning!. Goodnight again!
Thanks.. I hope your day was great.. I miss you.. Good morning.. Have a great day.. Goodnight.
Sweet dreams to you too.. I'm still in Harrisonburg. We're about to go to the pool today. We went for a walk last night and then played a card game.. I love you too!
It would be nicer with you.. The internet is poor, but I hope that I get the picture!
You look gorgeous!
No boo-boo kisses???. It's so late!. You should really go to sleep.
Thank you for talking to me, I like hearing the stories, but it's difficult to respond.
Yeah. They say they are trying to get it fixed, but it's unlikely it will be before we leave.. But I enjoy the updates!. Goodnight and sweet dreams!
I love you so so so so much too!. (hug) (hug). I hope your dreams make you super cuddly!
I hope so! :3. Goodnight!. Good morning!. Goodnight.
Good morning!. Have fun in Hong Kong! I love you too!
I love you, Cutie!. Goodnight!!!. You look so happy!
We went to the water park and I went on a walk with my dad later yesterday.. Good morning!. I saw an even tinier toad on the walk last night too!!. Not as cool as seeing a monkey, but there were a family of deer and I saw a few fawns!. And some gophers!. Not very special, but it was neat.
They just scurry away!. They almost waddle.
More like penguins.
Maybe not so much, but they waddle!. Good morning!
Thank you (:. How were your dreams?
Awesome!. How was your previous day?
Better spirits? Were they too tired?
That happens.. Some people become grumpy when they don't sleep as much as they'd like to.
It was nice being caught!. I love you!. Have a nice time!
^~^
Tah tah for now!. I hope to be caught more often!
Pictures of you??. Or of me?. (change the broken heart to a normal one!). Oh no!. I didn't see the cigar D:. This is better (:
Good morning, Cutie!
I'm safe in Blacksburg.
Goodnight and sweet dreams!
(hug)(hug). Sleep tight!. Has Hong Kong been any better?
I look so silly!. I love you too!
I'm alright.. How are you?
I'm talking to you!
:P. I overslept today o.o
:3
The walks we went on were nice.
Just the company.. It wasn't anything I hadn't seen before.
I hope you do too!. It takes time for people to adjust to new sleeping habits.
You'll just have to be chipper for the rest of them!Oh.Of course I want to (:. I love everything about you and I love being with you. Without you I don't feel at home. sorry.. really silly. I don't think it's possible for you to think about me as much as I think about you. so.. silly. I should be quiet. sorry
(:. You're so amazing. I just have a hard time thinking that I deserve you
See.. that's how I feel.. I think about you all the time
Like.. in my dreams too. No way, you're so amazing (:. There's no one better than you, you're the bestest. I have to try so hard to be perfect.. I don't even think I'm doing it right
I'm so afraid that you'd find someone better. that's why I didn't feel like I did a good job with your present. You deserve the world.. and all I could give you were bike accessories and a few drawings. I didn't even make a good enough card
I just feel like.. I need to make you soo happy
and if I don't.. then I'm just not needed. I'm really glad you guys liked the cupcakes
Well that's good. I love your smile. I've just never really been good enough for anyone
But like.. I wasn't good enough. I had to fix myself
But like.. I'm not. or I wasn't. What I am now.. I guess that's perfect. but.. before I wasn't really anything. and because of that I still feel like I"m not really anything. I'm*. You found me and made me want to be the best I could ever be.. but when that wasn't enough.. I felt worthless
I was at one point
that hasn't been that long. I'm sorry. I just feel like.. I've had to try really hard to be everything you could ever want. if you want me at all..
I am just me. I just.. I worked to become who I am. and.. I just never feel good enough. because if I wasn't at one point.. I don't know.. I just feel like there's more to correct
Well.. I guess it's okay for you to be bias. because all I could want is to be the best for you
(: I really really like you too. You've sort of.. stolen my heart. not that I mind, of course
I wouldn't think so. and since my dad is my first period teacher.... if I forget to get it signed by a parent. you know... and (:. You're heart is perfect. and I want to keep it for as long as you let me
I'm so lost as to what you're doing. I'm assuming something to do with music.. of sorts. you can keep my heart forever if you like. sorry... but I should let you do that then?. sorry... have fun (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams, I hope to see you tomorrow. I'll try not to interrupt anything like I did this morning. I just was eager to talk to you
and you just.. didn't see me
If you want to. you don't have to
I really like you, Leandra
Goodnight and have an awesome 2nd day of school tomorrow. Oh yeah, you actually were in my dream last night. like you said you would be :P
You actually wanted to hang around in the dream. but then I had to wake up for school
sorry about what?. I really liked the dream :P. :D. I hope I don't either. I'm so sorry for everything. Goodnight and sweet dreams
I'm sorry.. it's just silly.. it's not like you need to know or if it's important
You're so happy to begin with.. I couldn't cheer you up :P. Goodnight though
Goodnight, Leandra. Sweet dreams. You're amazing
crazy.. eating marshmallows right now
sorry for everything. bye
Leandra?. never mind I guess. I'm sorry. I had something to give you.. but I forgot about it all day and it broke in my pocket :/ I'm sorry. sorry, it didn't really matter I guess.. but I thought it was sort of neat, but it's silly now that I think about it.  I'm sorry to bother you or anything, we both know I wouldn't want that.. so have a great rest of your day (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams (:
yeah, it wasn't that special
but I meant to give it to you for the longest time..
But you know.. I give you one of those bark heart things all the time anyway . so it wasn't that special. this one was just really neat looking
I don't know.. it's in more pieces than I had hoped. I don't really know how it was before. but it's not too special. But I just thought that I could give you my heart before I broke it
it's not that special
nah, I'm not special. but I shouldn't waste your time
I am wasting your time?. aw... Well, I'm sorry. I'll let you get to your paper. have fun and goodnight
Free as in when?
Aw, I wouldn't want to keep you up later than you have to. not pointless.. just, school tomorrow :P
I guess so 
don't be sorry. Are you actually done with it?
You can keep holding on to it
It's fine though
Just give it to me when you're ready. no need to rush :P
Okay I guess.. yours?
If you want to
that's crazy (:
Nah, that couldn't be it :P. I'd like to see you too (: I love seeing you and being with you.. and everything. You're the highlight of my day. sorry.. silly. I'm sorry if I seemed bothered or something.. if I did at all. Because I wasn't.. I was just in the way
No, I was.. like.. in the hallway
I was crowding it and people were walking into me
I really really like you too (:. It's fine.. 
You too, and have fun reading. See you tomorrow, goodnight and sweet dreams. You're amazing. haha.. I wish.... never mind. bye (:
I'm sorry. My wishes never come true. but I wish you chose me. but doesn't matter, goodnight (:. it* doesn't matter*
If you say so :P
Sweet dreams (:. Have fun with stuffs
haha. Do you like my shirt?. G'night (:. You're perfect (:
It's fine (:
you should be thinking about school though :P. bye (:
And if you need help with anything ever.. I may not be the best to ask, but I'd like to try . Night (:. Sleep well and read well
Nah, you're amazing (: You're the bestest. Bye
Bye Leandra, thanks for everything
Nah, you are (:
Just everything (:. You're amazing :D
You too. Bye :D
Well I'm glad my cupcakes could make you happy (: Cross country was.. not the greatest, in fact it was extremely hard today.. so, not fun.. but I hope that you have fun and that I can possibly talk to you or something.. probably not though, but I can hope. Oh, I've gots something for you, if you want it.. I found the thing and thought of you, but it's like.. not that important :P. Well, since I have nothing else to do, I think I'll go on a bike ride. I hope you have fun with your stuffs and have a great time in college, I'll miss you. Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. oh yeah, and sleep well!. haha, my wishes never come true.. sorry I'm just like.. spamming your inbox, sorry for that
Not.. particularly . :P yeah.. I hope that your Saturday is going well . Yeah, hope you had a great day, sleep well, goodnight and sweet dreams
I miss you too and I love you. (:. You're way more perfect :D
Well, that sounds pretty perfect
I'm sorry my shirt stopped smelling like me.. I can always wear it again and let you have it :P
And I still have that thing to give you, if you want it.. it's sort of silly
I love you so so so much too (: 
the thing is sort of silly. and I was planning on leaving it at your doorstep or something, so that you'd find it when you got home
kind of like magic soda :P
your house probably does that. hmm.. maybe I can be all ninja and sneak over and leave it now :P. It's late, so I probably wouldn't be technically allowed (not by my parents, but your mom) so I feel like I could like.. pull that off :P
I love you too (:. I understand it's not.. the same over chat, but it's still sort of nice. but yeah, you'd like.. never see me coming though, I'd be soo ninja. :D. And in the morning you go outside and you'd see this thing layin' there
you should check (:
I don't have a phone
Oh.. all sorts of types. sort of.. miss matched. this one here is.. "Uniden"
haha
:3
You're amazing. (:
Don't forget, 20 minutes.. unless the shadowlurker gets me first
Unless he's right behind you
You're amazing
He could be :D
I'll be back soon (:
Bye for now. you too
Okay, I'm back :P. Not that it matters :P
It was.. full of traffic. but it was alright. You may find that you house is a bit more magical tonight :P
but.. not that I'm implying anything or not
umm.. I wouldn't do that
Kind of hurt that you would think I would
If that's what you think I did.. maybe I should just take all of it back
Yeah. Have to check it out to find out
I was "never" there
Exactly
You should see what I trained them to do. it would be the.. right pillar?
if you were.. facing the house
I wonder what :P. Remember, 1st right pillar. by the steps. facing the house. :P
(:
That.. by the way, was surprisingly hard to make
and I found the bottle cap and was like, the cute turtle would be something Leandra would like
Nah, you're awesome (:. I don't even know what I do to be "awesome"
I'm sorry though. I wish that I could hug you.. but you're so far away
I've been hugging that bear you gave me for Valentines.. and it's just not the same. You're back already?. :D
The other 'o' is a normal 'o'. Well I mean.. you do make me feel fuzzy inside, and the bear is fuzzy.. but it's not you
So much bark..
I broke so many 'v's and 'u's. But like.. I put my heart into that sushi cat. and it's way cuter than me, it should be better :D
nah, no way
It took me days to write out the entire thing.. I just got done with it tonight
I mean, it's not as good as actually saying the words... so.. I'm sorry
(:. Of course you still have me (:. I really wish I could like.. I don't know
You're way more amazing
It'll be so late then. It's probably silly to want to see you and stuff.. I just.. I sort of miss you. which is probably silly too. I'm sorry
nah, probably not
I'm sorry. You probably just have to see me for a second to be normal
(:. I would like that. sorry. You're amazing (:
or just crazy
that's crazy. You're so so so amazingly perfect (:. Sorry.. 
That's way you (:. You're like.. talking about how amazing and perfect you are. it's weird
I don't see the x :P
I don't think it's there
no way, it spells your name out more than it does I
that's crazy. that must be it. You must be on my mind right now :3
like graffiti.. or a giraffe 
You're so cool 8-|. and amazing. (:. aww.. I missed 11:11
sorry.. I should.. probably let you go
nah, not really. but yeah it's late and I wouldn't want to bother you
if you say so
I feel like I'd be very bothersome then
I'm sorry
not that perfect. I'm sorry. I should let you get some sleep. You've probably had a long day . and I'm no fun. yeah, so.. goodnight and sweet dreams
You're more perfect. I hope the same for you. except that they.. don't like attack you. just.. hop and cuddle with you. :3
Goodnight, Leandra (: You're amazing and I hope you dream amazing things. Why would I be a great one?
nah, that's you (:
I was about to say like.. you'd be cuter than all the bunnies combines. combined*
I really really really like you too (:. And more, as the bark tells you
You're amazing (:. sorry.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I.. still miss you. sorry
nah, you're probably all busy n' whatnot 
it would.. but if you are then what are you going to do? :P. sorry, you're probably busy now. I'll just.. go then. goodnight
you wouldn't have to
haha.. I'm just going because I don't want to bother you
You should get sleep tooa. too*. But I'm assuming you won't be. Probably chatting with important peoples
and that's why I should go :P
crazy.. well good luck with getting them to go to sleep. or with.. suggesting it. anyway, sorry for wasting your time. Goodnight
G'night Leandra, sweet dreams (:
Yeah, it is supposed to rain, almost forgot :P. and you too. Tom and Jerry (:. sorry.. bye
Don't be sorry, I'm sorry that I just got those messages.. bye for now (:
Very very cool (: You have fun too
Awesome (:. Have fun with that stuffs. sounds like you're busy :P. yeah, have a great day n' stuff :D
Have you done your AP US?
There's a chance.. I can pull it up 
and by pull it up, I already checked it out. You have a worksheet
A worksheet you gotta print out
I guess you wouldn't remember your lunch pin :P
crazy. it's your full name.. . hmm
yes
first to last. Good thing it's open to guests :P
exactly :P
anyway, seems like a lot
so I'll let you get to that
I mean, if you study they shouldn't be. anyway, good luck, I shouldn't waste your time. Too bad it rained, I was hoping on going to the duck pond today
I bet I could still go, it hasn't rained in like.. 40 minutes or so. oh, and you sort of have to read on your own. like, yeah..
of course. Maybe I'll do that though
Seems like quite the idea
yes, maybe not so much since I'd be alone. but.. you know. it's somethin'
Well, it would be awesome to go with you. but you've got homework
I'm fine with waiting. and I guess there is.. I just.. I would like to see you. but.. I understand 
crazy
nah, no way. But I should let you get stuffs done and hopefully by 4 or so. maybe. I don't know. The worksheet looked sort of easy. so I feel like you could get that done fairly quickly. Bye (:. Have fun
Bye Leandra (:
haha, no cupcakes :P. You're amazing (:. Bye
:3 Bye for now. sorry... Yeah, I'll stop bothering you now. so sorry
whoa, crazy :P
awesome!
that's.. surprisingly dead on
nah, not really :P. sorry to be a disappointment 
I'm such a big disappointment though. :P. and yeah, it's a little freakier than that
I guess so. and sure I am
I think she does . and awesome, sounds like fun homework
GPS?
sorry
so sorry. I should probably leave you to get that homework done. seems like it stopped raining :P
Hmm
I wish I could help. :/. Okay.. 3 maps
1 of religion, 1 of ethnicity, and 1 of industry
Sorry, yes.. but that's sort of tied with industry. like.. technically
okay umm.. so you can't tell what's going on?. Maybe you can read the question and go back to the map
oh.. sorry. I'm just trying to help. I can make out the symbols.. as hard as that is to believe
different types. Is that the one with the line and the 2 lines through it?. ??. Or.. okay... fine. I'm a waste of time anyway.. thanks
sure there's a stick with a star at the top?. Which section is it in?
how about I just.. give you what I can read..  Anglican Episcopal  Baptist Congregational Dutch Reformed French (I can't read it) German Reformed Jewish Can't read Methodist Can't Read Presbyterian  Quaker Roman Catholic
I think.. I was contemplating on which #2 could be
It looked like the South had the least variety 
But I looked at the middle and was thinking that it could be that too
I wouldn't think New England would be that. because it was very diverse in the matter
I'm probably no help. sorry
It's not a waste of time though. because if I can somehow get it so that you're done sooner then I could possibly see you. if you.. wanted. unless you had more to do. I dunno.. it's probably silly of me
that's not good if you're taking this class..
I wanna like.. answer them. but like.. I can't do that
I feel like you can do it. maybe if I just.. stop talking to you and let you get your work done. Part B looks like the toughest part and it doesn't even look that difficult. I think if you start with that and go to the multiple choice you could fly by it. you know.. use all of your brain power on that and use whatever is left on the easy stuffs :P
ah.. I'm still not helping... I'm the worst ever
You're still on question 2?. that's crazy
I guess so
I'm pretty sure you knew that. so I'm still no help
nah. I'm just wasting your time
not really. I'm sorry
so sorry :/
Crazy fast
so crazy fast
sorry. I wasn't. so sorry :/. I'm just being lame.. I should just go or something
that way I wouldn't be bothering you either. I could go to the duckpond like I said I would.. but it would be kind of boring. but I wouldn't be wasting your time.. so I guess it's better if I do
It's fine, I sort of expected you'd be busy. I actually didn't expect much different. I hoped that I could get the chance to see you, but.. I don't know
yeah. especially like the one from last night. oh well..
Well surprisingly you were in my dream :P. and you were busy with stuff. but when I did see you you weren't keen on seeing me. but that's just a silly ol' dreamm. dream*
well, it looks like it could come true though 
if you say so
sorry, I should probably let you do your homework. I'll just uh.. go or something
oh, crazy . sorry
It's due tomorrow and you've got 1st period History
That would be pretty dramatic
Why would you be cutting your hand?. just kidding. sorry... ah.. I'm so lame. I think the duckpond sounds nice right about now. I still don't know though
hmm.. would you happen to be.. free?. or something... I don't know. seeing me probably sounds lame
I'll take that as "I'm not free"
oh. I'm confused
Oh well, seeing me isn't too great. don't have to be sad
nah.. not really
I wish I could sit outside with you :/
but I was going to go on a bike ride. if I pass by I'll wave
:/. or maybe not.. you know. I don't want to bother you. plus you have fun stuff to do. I'm sorry :/. and you're probably gone right now.. so I'll just leave. Yeah.. I found another random gift that I found. but I could just keep it because all of the ones I give you are pretty lame. and I feel like I'm just talking to myself. so.. I'll just go now
Have fun
I mean, it is late. and there's school tomorrow. and it's not like you needed to see me in the first place
from what?
so you can do something?
well.. you don't sound too excited about that.. . So I'm fine with being alone.. I guess. maybe.... sorry :/
It's fine. I don't have to see you if you don't want. I can just go on my lonely bike ride
I wouldn't want to bother you anyway
I would really like to see you, but you seem pretty set on that not happening.... :/
So.. yeah. Thanks for that
doesn't sound like it
You don't have to be. have fun doing stuff.. I'll go be alone now
I'm glad you insist on that. Really makes me feel 100%. Feels great...
It's whatever . I understand that I'm not important
sounds "serious"
totally taking that seriously 
sarcasm. completely
I meant, sarcastically, that you're taking that seriously
it's all whatever though
I'll just go feed some ducks some bark or something
Yeah, and I'd ask you to come, but you seem so set on not seeing me today
yeah.. just.. pretty much. Doesn't matter though
not much to miss...
so I hear... I don't know though, I wouldn't want to ruin your day. not that you wanted to see me in the first place
crazy
not really. Hey.. would you like to go to the duckpond?. Or anything?. Doesn't matter what... just would you like to do something?
I asked you
you shouldn't be. but yeah, whatever you want to do. we can do it. unless it's impossible.. . but in which case we can still try
anything else?. I don't know... if you're not going to take it seriously.. then I'll just assume you don't want to. if we do anything outside we should do it before it gets dark. :P. Unless you've changed your mind
we could bike ride, go to the duckpond, or we could just.. do something else
Like.. if you just want to sit down and watch disney.. that's fine by be. me*
yeah, Tom and Jerry
or vice versa
whatever you want to do though
well then that's hilarious. because what I want to do.. is what you want to do
whoa o.o
if you want to
just stop by?
oh.. that's okay
(:. See you soon
bye. :3 I really really like you, Leandra (:. But there was just one more thing I wanted to say before I left, but I didn't get the chance to. but I guess it can wait. You're so so *so* amazing (:. aw.. and I miss you already.... sorry..
you're so so so so so so very amazingly perfect (: sorry.. may have gone a little overboard.. but it's true :D  Have a great day tomorrow, goodnight and sweet dreams (:. sorry.. I liked your really tall tower, I didn't see it.. but I assume it was amazing
Nah.. I'm not that amazing. that's.. scary
your name was written on the whiteboard 
I forgot when was the tournament?
.. it's a Thai restaurant 
yes, but probably not on Sunday
I still don't know where it is :/
It's near the duckpond, I know that much. I do.. but I don't know how to contact them. So.. I'll just bring some bread and feed some ducks if I can't find it. silly, I know
I know. more fun with you though
yeah . or they like you (:. Which I don't blame them
Nah, who could miss me?. Obviously not you... Well, okay, have a great day. bye
it's fine
Nah
I doubt that 
okay
have fun. not for another 2 hours
:/. bye
I really like you too . sorry
sure there is
okay
explosion
haha. It's okay (:
I'm not cool. Are you tired of those random gifts I've been giving you?
coolers are bulky and usually in the way when unused 
and that's all I'm good for
That's crazy. and like.. literal crazy
Whoa, so crazy. Anyway, you should like.. expect a random gift around like.. say, 7 o'clock (:
or later.. depending on when robotics ends. I'm supposed to be ninja
but you could find it randomly at your porch steps
so crazy. but yeah. I'd actually give it a bit later. like.. 8 or 9
yeah :P. sorry. there's a chance you could see me if you come out around then :P
well.. if you catch me as I'm a ninja ya kknow. know*. (ninja k). Like.. I'm only a ninja because you wouldn't see me.. but you could if you chose to :P. haha, are you done with my zune yet?
whoa.. crazy
Hmm.. if I like.. went over now and hid it. then you'd come out at 8 and find it. that'd be so ninja. And now you're thinking I'd do that... hmm :P. You'll never know :P
nah
no worries. I probably can only go after robotics. because I don't want to bike there and be late. hmm.. 20 minutes to get there. I feel like.. around 8:30 would be the sneakiest time for me :P
exactly. Especially when I plan on going 10 minutes early just to trip you up
you'd be all like.. wait, darn that ninja. anyway, I should probably let you get your homework done. I feel so lame. sorry for that
I got mine done at school :P
lot of free time :P. I got my homework done in the classes they were assigned in. anyway, see you later if I fail at being a ninja. but.. if thing go according to plan. I'll miss you :/. things*. I fail so much :/. Bye
sorry. It's silly. You probably wouldn't want it. but I should go.. I'm so lame, sorry :/. Bye
oh, it's the 22nd
nice day, huh?
sorry.. I'll just go
Great talking to you (: And even better being a ninja with you :D You're so amazing, and I gotta get started on something else.... Thank you so so so much for the music (: You're so perfect, goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra (:
Does it matter for any reason?. anyway, did you ever read that turtle?. sorry. I feel bad for being all ninja just then...
yeah, I'm sorry. The note was pretty silly. sorry. and yeah, pretty ninja
Oh.. I found some ducks.. and they waddled over to your house. with like.. this thing. and it's at you steps :P. your*
it's not that great... like usual
nah, not really. but it's there. from that long walk home :P
With enough bread.. the ducks'll do anything. I biked to your house. like a ninja
but it's fine.. 
I didn't wanna.. I don't know
When did you check mail?
Yeah, you didn't notice. because I went over around 6:13
But then you would have seen me
nah.. because you would have seen me. I hope your job thingy was fun
that's awesome
Well I walked home.. which was alright
it was.. hot outside
I had to get my schedule stuffs. and it looked like they were like.. leaving by the time I got out
so it was my fault
I had to get Robotics on it
so now I'm good
does that person have like.. multiple online courses?
And like.. an after school one too?. that's.. ridiculous . I like the songs that randomly end in the middle. and then the ones that continue for another 3 minutes
yeah, it's like "hey.. this sounds cool" then stops
but it's such a good song. for however long it lasts
I don't recall
well it's cool. thank you for what you put on here (:. You really didn't have to
it's cool. You're amazing, you know that?. sorry for being lame and stuff
no, it's you. all the way. I'm just.. not amazing. I'm sorry for stuffs
nope
but I heard a song that was called "Do Better". And it said that I couldn't do anything right
I just.. don't know what you're trying to tell me
Well which ones am I supposed to take seriously? . Because it's really confusing me
maybe I have to let you borrow it again. just kidding . I also like the pictures on here :P
I feel so unoriginal now
but that drawing had a fez.. which means it was made after last seasons finale. and mine was made at the beginning of the series
So what does this song mean?. That your heart skipped a beat?
I was just kidding. I don't expect your heart to skip a beat
explains what?
How do I make you feel?. I.. sound like a psychiatrist 
Yeah, I know. ah, it's only fair. I do it to you.. . by.. forgetfulness . anyway, be safe and doorknobby :P. You'll do great (:
don't hit any elephants . It's fine. Just be safe so you can finish the story (:
I really really like you (:. Have fun
I hope you liked those hearts. sorry, Leandra
Bye (:
Whoa.. I can't believe I still haven't seen the movie Megamind :P. sorry.. random. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams! I hope you had a lot of fun today (:
so sorry. I'm so so so sorry. goodnight and sweet dreams. I didn't get all of the photos I needed.. I think I might have to try again
I'm sorry
I just wanted to wish you a goodnight. and I wanted to hear your voice again. sorry. I'm also sorry for those barks tonight. I don't think that dog liked me
yeah, around.. 8:53 ish
well, I was just more ninja then
I know. I was out there for a good 10 minutes writing you a note
that's silly. There's nothing special outside at that time
nah, not really. my "luck" charm isn't really working though. so.. it's not special either
that note I wrote for you isn't special either. and it might've blown away by now, who knows
okay
so bad. and that's on the back. you're reading the wrong side
That's good . I'm sorry for getting less and less creative with ninja gifts. It's really not that special though
yes?
I am indeed
if you want to. you don't have to if you gotta go
you're welcome
Well I think you are
okay, bye . Goodnight and sweet dreams. So.. I'm having an awful day, but it's okay because at least you care. don't*. sorry...
.. it doesn't really matter, sorry.... :/. Goodnight and sweet dreams.. thanks for today. :/
no I'm not...
I'm really not
I got poured on. by the time it stopped raining it looked like I fell in a swimming pool. so.. my photography got interrupted 
yeah.. won't help. I feel kinda sick now... not that you would care though
You really made that clear
sorry.. sarcasm wasn't clear 
I was sarcastic
it's okay
I'm sorry
I am
it really hurt though..
you didn't, did you?. And no... just.. today
you just walked away. and it made me feel like you chose differently
just... 10 minute break and after school. but it's whatever.. I guess it's not important
you probably don't even know what I'm talking about
maybe it's best to be rude
I don't know. Like... you walked away in 10 minute break so I thought you didn't want to see me and then you popped up later during the break
My 3rd period class was. but 2nd wasn't
so you walked away and then I saw you outside of the pod. but when I tried to catch up I got stuck in the flow of the hallway. and then you were with Patrick. and then after school you stayed with Patrick. and you made it clear who you wanted to be with
yeah, I gotcha
It's okay. I just.. felt a little broken
It's not your fault. I don't deserve anything
nah... I deserve nothing. I don't deserve hugs, or you holding my hand, or anything. I'm pretty much just there 
If I deserved any of that I'd get it..
Yeah, that's okay. It's not like you have to
and I don't know why you'd want to
So that's probably why you don't
that's more important anyway
definitely is
I'm not important at all
I'm just broken. anyway.. have fun
I'm not, but it's okay. I've never thought I was important. and I'm not treated like I am. so.. it's hard to belive. believe*
anyway.. have fun.. bye and goodnight
no fun here.....
I'm not
right...
okay. anyway, if you tried.. who knows. sorry. I shouldn't ask anything of you. anyway.. bye
It's not a lot to ask for, I don't think.. but I'm probably wrong
sorry, I shouldn't keep you any longer
and that's about it.
nothing's amazing about me. anyway, I'll just log out so you don't have incentive to stay
not really. anyway.. bye
you don't have to. and I won't. I've had a pretty bad day :/. anyway.. goodnight
you don't have to do anything. and you don't have to either
yeah, you can.. talk to me then if you want. unless you're busy
and it wouldn't be much fun anyway. calling me would be silly, you should study
if you want to
it's okay
it's okay. no need to be sorry. and yeah, you're so silly. but no one said that was a bad thing (:
sorry
it's okay if you don't
bye. Today was the first time I had ever cried during school.. not that it matters                                                             . so sorry :/ have a nice day. Whoa.. gobblerfest...
I'm fine
It's okay. I stopped crying a while ago. so I'm okay
I was just.. sad
if there were a reason, it doesn't matter
nah
but.. like.. yeah
I'm fine
I guess so
sure it does
you were in your class
you just sort of left me in the hallway. and after 6th you seemed like you were in a hurry, so I just went to my class
It's okay
and I thought I could see you after 7th. but I couldn't. so I felt like you just didn't want to see me. that's all it was
it's fine. you didn't have to be and I'm sure you were busy
it's fine, really
you're not a letdown :/
I don't think you are
:/. I'm sorry
I was just about to say that you're amazing. (:
if you wamt. want*
That means I owe you a soda, right?
I'll give you a soda anyway (:. eventually at least
exactly (:. I should be ninja soon or something. you're probably busy. so it could be an opportune time
I was going to go too. but.. I don't have to. :/ . I need a tissue again. anyway, have fun at gobblerfest. bye
nothing...
have fun... bye
maybe. but you.. don't. have. to. call..
bye. I'm the worst ever. But you're the best. !! (:. I hope you have a great day (:
That's crazy (: I was smiling too! You're amazing and perfect and I really really like you so much (: Have fun doing whatever you do and I hope it works out too, but it's okay if it doesn't. whoa.. you're moms alarm is the same as my moms phone ring :P. Hello there. sorry, my bad. I don't want to take up your time if you're busy. yeah, you're probably busy. Have a great day though. sorry :/
sorry. I like yours more (:. sorry
Well.. maybe we can make a trade off (:
I want your smile.... just kidding. I want to see you (:. and you smile. and be happy (". (: 8. *. the 8 made a bow cameo 
haha. (:. You're so amazing 
Doctor Who is coming out (:. It's not as amazing as you though. I'd prefer to see you than to see Doctor Who. !!.. I never got to see your SCA video :/
worst news?. I got you in trouble didn't I..
How'd you get yourself in trouble?. if you don't mind me asking. I still think it's my fault
oh, that's my fault for staying then. It was difficult to leave though :/
I loved talking to you (:. You're amazing :D. I feel bad for getting you in trouble though
anyway, I found a link for Doctor Who.. I haven't watched it yet... but if you want to. http://www.putlocker.com/file/D3DE12220FA7BB67. there it is
Well, you can if you want
yeah, you can go ahead
That would be neat. that's a new episode too
No, Amy was pregnant with River
haha (:. I was going to post a song on your profile
but it looks like someone beat me to it
Oh well, someone beat me to the punch. I was 18 minutes too late
possibly. because my heart beats for you
Whoa.. you liked my link?. Are you tired too?
I like all your everything :D
No way (:
Everything about you is perfect (:. You gotta let me know which songs on here were the "special" ones. I could make a playlist for them (:. I wanna make you like.. a cd now... but I feel like all the music I could give you you'd already have or you wouldn't like
that's silly
haha (:
You're my whole heart (:. (:. I like the song :D
You didn't put that on here if that's what you were looking for
wait.. wait. it's here (:. !! :D. You're so amazing
and all I want is you (:
haha, you can count on me (:
I hope you can catch me because I'm already falling
sorry
:D
isn't it nicer to let them roam free?. sorry for tickling you. and trying to "imitate" those butterflies. I did a bad job of it
pshh... if I cause the butterflies.... then how can I be better?. It's like.. you have to go with both. it's a package deal here :D. sorry
what?. I told them that's what they needed to do
haha (:. 8|8. that's a butterfly . not as good as the ones you give me.. but.. yeah (:
whoa.. Maybe I'm Just Tired came on my zune
Yeah (:. I'm not good enough for you, but I'm glad you have me anyway :D. or.. want me at least (:
lions aren't that tall. that's reasonable . :P. I'll always try to be better for you 
umm.. um. I don't think I've paid attention to the band names
I'm sorry. I'll pay more attention to them (:
whoa. I was going to say something. but.. I don't think it matters
haha. :D. well like... remember when you asked me why I chose you?
well.. I had been so worthless and broken before. but you were able to pick me up and make me smile
Well like.. no one really cared about me before
and I liked how you were so happy about everything
It made me happy too
I found someone who could make me smile and I knew wouldn't break my heart. so.. I picked you
it didn't hurt so bad when you did
couldn't what?. sorry
I fell pretty hard to be honest
it just reminded me that I was right . because even if someone did love me.. they'd just break me. before they just didn't care. but I was able to have someone care and leave me like I was nothing
that's why I'm not good enough... because I wasn't then and I wasn't ever. for anyone. shuffle really likes playing that song..
I'm so scared you're going to do it again
I remember the words
they've been like.. burned in my memory
you did. I remember it. not word for word. but I know it pretty well
I don't think you quite know how bad that hurt for me. and I keep trying to make sure you never let me go again
you did once
Back to the Future?. Part I
500 Days of Summer?
Oh.. that one. you could of said about hiking. and I would have know what you were talking about. and I was nervous too.. 
when you said that I thought you were going to break my heart again
I know . I know you love me. I love you too (:. So so so much. I really like "Say You Like Me". that song. I'm never going down I'm never giving up
that's what I was thinking about the entire time. The entire time. Like.. you broke my heart. but when you came back into my life. Just.. I'm never going to give you up again. because.. I feel like that's what I did last time
I didn't want to message you because I felt like you moved on. and that I'd just start crying again if I did
I'm so so so so so sorry :/
I stopped poking you :'(
Because like.. . I don't know. my heart would sink every time I saw "Leandra Irvine has poked you". because I thought you were happy with someone else. someone who I wasn't. someone who was better than me
I would open your profile up every now and then
and I'd think about poking you. or messaging you. but then I'd see "Engaged to...". and I'd leave
And I tried moving on.. but it was so hard :/. Everyone reminded me of you. and how they could never be as great. every homecoming too. you were always with someone else
I didn't know you were with someone... I was told by Cody and Gap that you were looking for me
I wanted to ask you to both :/. both Homecomings. but I was so nervous the first one and the second you were still "with" someone. but you showed up with someone else. Hold on
http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1208058017738&set=t.1509734112&type=1&theater. That photo is of Vaughn. but I'm in the background looking for you
It was so hard to see you with someone else at Homecoming. I wanted it to be me so bad. but I had to play it cool. because I knew if I had payed more attention to you.. I would have cried. I probably would have left
haha, the entire time I was thinking about how pretty you were
But I had to ignore you, because I was still heartbroken at that time
Well like.. I never got over you. you were still on my mind . like.. all the time. I saw how hard you tried to see me though. joining track, joining Art Guild. you know.. just to see me
you made it impossible to think about you
stop* thinking about you
Oh, I wasn't originally in Roots and Shoots. I was wandering to find the club I was going to join. but I saw you go to roots and shoots. sorry for following you there. I wait here forever just to see you smile. I'm nothing without you
haha.. there's 41 reasons to be in love with you. (Sum 41). :D
convinced on what?
(:
I'm sorry for disagreeing . all those times you say I'm amazing. I know you mean it. but there's still a part of me..
Like..
as I've been saying. no one really liked me before. they just broke my heart. I just found that I was perfect enough for anyone. I wasn't amazing or awesome or anything. That's what I grew up to
one said "eww.. gross"
no one paid attention to me until Sophomore year
See though
I feel like if they had liked me.. I wouldn't have turned the way I am now. And I feel like I wouldn't have met you at all
haha, it's silly stuff
like.. it was in 4th grade.. and she moved to Australia . like.. it didn't matter at all
And yeah, spend as much time you want. It's okay. she didn't like me anyway. she was like "gross, he must have cooties"
4th graders :P
No one dated in mine..
oh.. mine was silly
and yeah, 6th grade was a big turning point anyway
I mean, I really didn't care then
It was like.. okay, she doesn't like me.. I'm going to go play legos
haha. 6th grade ruined my life. I do feel
I was so afraid of getting in trouble in 6th grade, that I wouldn't talk. and that made people think I was weird
and this one girl didn't like me... Like.. I was goofing off
I was trying to have fun. but my teachers didn't like that. so I just.. I shut up
Mr. Bridges. His deep voice scared me
oh she was alright
but after 6th grade I just didn't talk
he retired after 6th grade I think
but yeah.. no one likes the quiet kid
That continued to 9th grade
I became shy because of 6th grade
I just.. couldn't do it. see, after 9th grade I was determined to open up
so bad :/
I never met you in middle school
crazy
haha
haha. but yeah, after 9th grade. I grew my hair out and decided to talk more. I was still shy when talking to girls though. because they've only hurt me before. sigh.. I found so many reasons that it was my fault and that I just wasn't good enough. just to explain it
I'm telling you my whole like.. and you don't even need to know it. I'm sorry
well I opened up for the most part. and you came along and made me think "Hey, maybe not all girls are bad"
me neither :??. :/. I wouldn't talk to anyone unless they said hi first
I couldn't believe you were talking to me. and I knew I'd mess everything up for some reason
I'm so scared though. I try so so so hard
Because I've had such poor luck in the past
talking about my past is making me tear up
it's fine
I'm glad you're here for me now
haha, I wouldn't stop you if you had to
it's so cold in here
only with you though
I rolled my sleeves down. sort of helping
I also thought that you were really innocent when I first met you
yeah..
because like.. a lot of girls aren't as nice or caring. I don't know what made me think that. is it not true?
I also didn't know about your boyfriend. so.. at first... ya know..
but you kissed him anyway
I guess a boyfriend doesn't do that
'oh yeah, kiss anyone you want, but your boyfriend.. it's cool because he's nicer'. sorry
I know
Don't be
I'm all ears. but you don't have to. I'm sorry for giving you my story
It's full of me getting abused and taken for granted . such a nice story
I felt bad that I had a few simple crushes. I felt that that made me a bad guy
I've never even kissed a girl. My crushes weren't even important I didn't even care about them. they were just there. and I thought that they were nice. they broke me though. I've only liked one person. because I don't count the others as me "liking them". because I barely knew them
and the only person I've ever liked.. broke me just like those crushes
and I blame myself
I'm glad I can be considered your boyfriend though
Sometimes I think I'm trying too hard. because you're my first girlfriend, you're the first person to care about me. and I just don't want to mess anything up. because like I stated.. I blame myself for that sort of stuff
someone asked me once.. "If she won't kiss you now, how do you expect that she won't just leave you when you go off to college"
I told the person, "I love her, that's how I know"
I don't want you to leave though
because I couldn't handle it when you did the last time
Which February?
Someone asked me the same thing. It's probably a conspiracy 
haha. I liked you so much then
I've liked you since I've known you. and now I'm glad to say that I love you (:. sorry
You haven't lost me yet
(:
haha (:. I think that's a bit of an exaggeration. At least we've made it this far
You have given me a heart attack, you'll never know what it's like to have to face the fact you might let go but I won't stand for any thought of that, heavens no, because I will cling to you I'll always have a stronger hold
Yes 
and this is the best thing (:
(:
You're so amazing. last night.. or this morning.. which I got really quiet. I felt like I'd never be the first of anything for you. I'm sorry, it was silly of me
because at least I have you now (:. It's okay (:
whatever that something is.. I'm glad :D
I'm glad and lucky that you even want me :D
I can't imagine not being yours. sorry
(:. And I told you about my whole life pretty much. so you know me better than anyone (:. I don't even know what else there could be to know about me
I just.. I know I can talk to you. which makes me super happy (:
I love you so much, Leandra. everything about you is amazing. Like.. it's silly, but I just love everything. things that you might not love, I love so much. just everything
I love the way you curl you toes and I love your nose, I love your ears and I love your fears. I'm making this rhyme for some odd reason. I love it when I hear your heartbeat . I'm so silly..
no, I said "I'm so silly"
I could ask you to name one thing you don't like about yourself
and it would be perfect no matter what
name something then
no way. you're so perfect. (:
name something then
I've never noticed. *so* perfect (L. (: *
I think it's cute if you mess up
sorry
aw.. well. can't win everyone over
Don't I know it
I don't know why. But I find that our moms are somewhat similar
if that's not crazy sounding
haha. I'm sorry for that
tis*. :D
tis* . sorry. so.. umm. How should I put this?
I love you so much, Leandra. (: 
I didn't know how to make that sound special
I'm glad you have my heart
I might have. I don't really notice
oh no.. you didn't like.. take all of my music, right?
oh, phew. see.. like I'd be fine with it n' all. there's just this one album. I was worried that like.. if you wanted to that you could have taken it
no no no 
Saving the Melody. which would be impossible for you to have heard of them before. because it's my song. I wrote it. and it's embarrassing
you probably read it
it's unoriginal, I know
yeah :P
You didn't listen to it, right?
aww. it's so bad :/
you're just saying that
well.. if you say so
it's on my zune. no where else
I could always sing it to you..
It wouldn't be so great though. that's silly. my singing is terrible
I love your voice.. I sometimes wish I could do a duet with you
we sang together last night.. and I thought we sounded pretty good. :D
that's what I thought
except for I.. I forgot the lyrics so easily
no doubt (:. We're so amazing together (:. I was the one singing the songs.. you just came along and sang them better. wow.. my song came on
So amazing together 
I feel like, without you.. I'd be getting only 3 stars on rockband
It was so fun (:. I'm so shy when it comes to singing. I'm afraid people will just judge it harshly . aw, I'm tempted to be all like "Guess what, Leandra!". and then call you and say "I love you". but.. I feel like it'd be silly. and I just told you... so no surprise any more
what?
:D. way way cooler (:. so so so perfect. Goodnight and sweet dreams
Have fun (:
I really really really like you (:. so amazing. sorry. Bye (:. Sweet dreams again (:
I'm so lucky!
I really really like you (:. You're so amazing. and I hope your day is fantastic, like you (:. I wish I could give you something :P But it's not important or anything. I'm really sorry for getting you in trouble. Goodnight and sweet dreams! (:. Sorry again for being lame/scary.. I'll do better next time. Yeah, next time I'll use my head and stop myself from doing anything like that again.. anyway, I hope you have  a great day (:
Aw. Darn. I want you to be mine still (:. If you want... sorry. Bye
Of course :D
Can I still be yours?
Of course I want to (:. (:. I have something to give you, if you want it.. of course. it's silly
sorry, that's why I write in all caps
because my normal writing is weird
I like the way you write (:. Because it's by you :D. and you are amazing
Yeah, I wish I could give you the thinging. thingy*
I can always drop the thingy off. if you were okay with that
I've got school to go to
so I can always do it after that. I'd have to bike after school
You aren't. (:
you're never in the way. it would be late though. like 8:20ish
If you don't want to see me, it's cool. you could just say so
you don't sound like you do
haha :D. You're so amazing. still sorry for the note
I should have made it more clear n' stuff
I'm sorry :/
I've never gotten a note.. so I wasn't aware of the creepiness 
so sorry. You're just.. cute though. sorry. I should just go :/
:/
sorry :/. I'll just head over to robotics... so sorry :/. I feel really stupid right about now
whoa.. Just remembered.. robotics isn't until 6. I feel ever dumber now :/
Miss what? . It's just me
that's a silly thing to miss
nah. not really. you're the perfect one
just like you say you're not cute..
You're so crazy
(:. I may be a little crazy too then :D. but don't be sorry . You really are perfect and amazing though. way more so than I (:
cooling bill
it's so cold
:/ I'm so sorry for everything
I just feel like . I do a lot wrong*
Nah, I'm the luckiest, because I have you (:. but I just feel bad for anything I may have wished for.. but I'll try to make it up to you :D
you shouldn't. you're amazing (:
good at what?
well thank you (:. And I'll have you know, I haven't wished for anything silly like that for a while now. Only stuff that could make you happier (:
apparently.. hugs make you live longer.. or so I've heard. That's crazy though. Those butterflies never know when to leave :P. I wonder why they keep coming back
I probably still don't live longer :P
the magic only works for so many people :P
I was hoping you weren't kidding.. but okay. sorry. so sorry. but hey, maybe I can ninja gift you sooner than 8:20
Nah, you were probably kidding
You said you were
sorry. but yeah, ninja gift. :D. I've got like.. a few things, so I can like, ninja gift you twice. or.. once
hmm.. maybe. anyway, I think I should go and be a really good ninja or something. unless you're opposed to that idea
yeah, right now. if that's okay with you
okay, neat (:. if everything works out, I won't see you later. but if I fail.. then see you soon (:
bye
Sleep super well (:. Goodnight and see you tomorrow, sweet dreams (:. You're so so so so so so so so amazing, I don't know if I can say it enough :D
I was great, I was smiling the whole way home, although I may have looked silly by the looks people gave me, but that's okay (: I like being silly. Thank you so so so so much for that yo-yo! That must have taken forever (: You're so amazing.. I just want to hug you again.. and thank you for the yo-yo :D You're so amazing 
I really really like you. more, Leandra (: sorry.. just you're the best (: Goodnight! 
You were looking for me? :/ I was looking for you too.. sorry :/ I hope you have a nice day too.. aww.. I sorta missed you, as crazy as that sounds. Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I think I'll just leave the yo-yo on your steps, if that's okay. I successfully managed to keep the box intact (: but.. I don't exactly know which words I'm supposed to be looking for :P but thank you so so so so much (: You're so amazing! Goodnight and sweet dreams, I really really like you, so much, Leandra! (:. I just remembered that I had something to give you that I had forgotten to give you :/
aw, sorry
It's I who has the bad timing
but you really are the most special person ever (:. I wish I could give you that thingy. which is probably the silliest thingy ever. but.. still. sorry. I should probably let you get to stuffs
Well I wasn't using the luck. so.. I'm glad you even wanted to borrow it
Well I'm glad it was of use
Done better?
that's crazy talk
good one. ah.. I wish I could see you and give you that thingy. but it serves no purpose at all. and who would want to see me?. plus you're probably busy
really?. It's super silly. and you're still probably busy
the library, which is closer than your house... is out of the way. but you?. Never :D
sorry. so.. can I come and see you?
That would sound amazing (:. I'll see you soon then.. because I really want to. sorry... but umm.. bye
yes, if that's alright
I don't know how long I can stay though :/
someone is letting me borrow their recording equipment and I need to borrow it. sorry. redundant. and I need to pick it up*
but yeah, see you soon (:
They weren't mad at all.. and my leg is having like... spasms and hurts like crazy, it's weird.. anyway, to more important things, you're way cooler! (: You're amazing :D Goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra (:
Sweet caramel dreams, may I add (:
whoa, it's me
It's not that amazing. it's just me 
What is amazing is that you're on (:
how?. I'm sure it smells amazing
aw, I'm sorry. I wish I didn't have to go away
nah
I could stay forever if you wanted
I'm sorry. It's not really meant to get your hopes up. Because I could (:
yeah, you're right. with enough time you'll get tired of me
there's no way I could get tired of you. (:
I like when you get sleepy
silly stuffs. sleep mostly :D
for what?
It's okay (:
You only say perfect things (:
you should trust me, every new day I see you you only get more and more perfect (:. and I'm excited too
(:. You're so amazing (:. I should probably be letting you get some sleep
that's crazy. I could say the same about you (:
which color?
Peter Shamrock? . I can't believe that guy..
That was your favorite color? That was one of mine once upon a time. I think he is. but he's always the guy I hear people talk about. and even you
I mean, you mentioned the name
I don't know. I'm sorry. I should leave you with that irish guy. goodnight
probably the coolest guy ever
sorry. :/
Goodnight and sweet dreams

Honey bear, honey bee don't forget that you love me more than the stars over your head (:
You're so amazing (:. Anyway I should be letting you get some sleep . Goodnight and sweet dreams (: . So perfect (:
I love you too (:. So much :D. You're so perfect. goodnight!. See you tomorrow hopefully
I could have sung that too :D
"You make me smile". (:. Sorry, anyway. I think I could write a song about you.. and it'd be perfect just because you're in it. but if you weren't in it.. then it wouldn't be as good
Of course (:. I read those old ones.. and they aren't even any good. but these new ones... I don't mean to braggg, but (flicks own nose)
that's crazy. but thanks (;

It's okay (:. It stops hurting quickly
Thanks you for making me the luckiest guy ever (:. Bye for now :D. g'night. I'll log out.. just so you have no incentive to stick around . although.. maybe you still have incentive. but ya know.. I won't be to blame

Awesome. maybe soon?. The movie Space Jam is coming on cartoon network!. (:. I really like that movie :P
We should watch it! . if you want... I really liked it. but I haven't seen it in forever

We're here together! :D. how are you?
worst song ever :P. I'm alright. aw... I guess I should let you get to that pool party thingy. bye :/
the 'aw' was because I thought you left
swim?. see.. I would like to go with you, especially since I already said I could. I may have to mow though :/
I'm sorry
Well my sister is my help.. but she doesn't really want to. but I couldn't ask that of you
I mean.. if you wanted
I could give you one, of course. I couldn't pay you right away, however
that's silly. I can always fix it
I meant.. fix it as in.. I don't know. somehow I'll fix it. you can't really go wrong. and afterwards.. you could go to le pool
if you wanted
awesome (:. I'll let you know when I have to mow. and I'll let you get to important stuffs prior to it. or.. you know.. you may have to ask
Oh I mean like.. I'll give you some time before you have to mow. to like.. do stuffs that you need to do. then I could call you when I'm ready
so.. bye for now (:. I'll call you in a little or so :D
neat (:. t.t.f.n.
Yeah, don't forget, my wallet is pretty bland as of now :P. sorry... I can't believe we were outside for like.. an hour and a half (oh, and you were right about the rain after all!!). You're so so so amazing, goodnight Leandra! :D. Oh, and this is like.. perfect sleeping weather :D. Have fun with driving and be safe!!. (adventure time is tomorrow! o.o). Whoa.. so much rain. anyway.. I'm just spamming your message feed, so I'll go ahead and sleep, g'night again! :D
You're probably all like "Ooo! there's more to read?" just kidding :D but maybe.. It was too rainy for me to deliver the bark, but I may be able to later or something
oh, well.. sorry then
I didn't get rained on. but maybe a picture of the prettiest girl ever could unbland my wallet
oh.. my voice is still gone, I think I left it at your house. glitter is girly. and gets on everything
not all girly and shiny?. Because your eyes glisten more than glitter. I can wait for my voice I guess. it's not that special to me
I'm positive I lost it sometime last night at your house. it's probably outside getting rained on
and random jokes? but nah, no one would just be out in the rain plus.. it's probably getting water damage right now It'll never be the same. sorry, random glitchy-ness
and random jokes? but nah, no one would just be out in the rain plus.. it's probably getting water damage right now It'll never be the same. and random jokes?. but nah, no one would just be out in the rain. plus.. it's probably getting water damage right now
It'll never be the same. I think the glitchiness is gone
a shamwow?
with the shamwow
whoa
crazy. so much rain. I don't think my voice is worth it anymore . I'll just have to get a new one
how was driving?
awesome! :D. I'm glad
I would have been devastated or something
awesome :D. I'm glad it was useful. If you ended up in the hospital.. I would visit everyday 
aw (:
I bet my hospital bed would be pretty comfy or something
of course. I'd let you have the heated blanket. so that you could always be warm with me (:
haha. remember me falling last night?. You totally distracted me
yeah, so okay :D. I rode up Harding hoping to see you more
but.. I didn't 
it's okay (:
I love every day with you, so I plan on a lot of days :D
I think the bark is getting rained on :/
good point
all I have you know it's yours (:
I hope not
I trust you (:
(:. Don't forget.. a house with a lawn and a dog with a cabinet full of glass
and us cooking bad food together (:
Whoa? Basement?!?
that'd be pretty cool :D
you'd be the coolest!!. but like.. my son will think differently. sorry :P
of course
totally the cool dad on disney
whoa.. whoa?
oh, I'm glad you're safe (:
of course
Hey, guess what?
Umm.. close. actually..
You're super amazing, I'm super lucky and I love you so much (:
a chance of finding a 4 leaf clover?. Those aren't lucky. those are just there :P. I'm really looking forward to that cabinet and sparkling cider 
I hope they become more than stories
good point. I can always wish for them
whoa.. where is the "your" to?. there* are two 11:11's everyday*?. sorry
oh, sorry. and you watch my heart break a little bit more
is your heart breaking a little bit more?. :/
Mine is okay. and my voice is still missing
please keep it safe (:. I'll keep yours as safe as possible
thank you (:
I like you (:. and I'm here for you
No worries. plastic is great stuff. :D. and I won't get mad if you do
(:. I can't wait
I won't be anywhere near your house today, I don't think at least. so I won't be able to find it any time soon. but okay, have fun writing that thingy :D. You're so amazing (:. sorry to waste your time thus far today
awesome (:. I love talking to you too (:
I just want to do it for as long as I can :D
you don't have to give me a wallet photo.. I'm sorry for that. but you should go do it, it's probably a lot of fun :D. thank you for everything and sorry for silly things
funny?. I was so serious :P
it's okay (:
you do the same for me :D. aw.. funnier?. :/
sorry.. bye
well.. it's okay
I know
you don't have to.. I just thought it'd be neat
you can definitely have one. why not use the photo of my shoulder?. just kidding
of course :D. the shoulder you can always count on. or something like that. you can lean/sleep on it whenever you want
nah, no way. but thanks. anyway, have fun with the writing stuffs (:
thanks (:. You're so amazing. I love you, bye Leandra (:
(:. You're the perfect one (:
I will admit.. that was good. but you're still more perfect (:. thank you for making me the luckiest guy ever
Bye Leandra (:
Thanks for the heads up (: Goodnight and sweet dreams, you're so so so so so amazingly perfect (:. Hello perfect, I know you're not around.. but I just wanted to say hi anyway (: You're amazing and have a great day :D. Goodnight and sweet dreams (: sorry for.. being lame n' what not. Hi (:. I said.. goodnight earlier.. n' stuff.. but I guess it didn't send
well, hold onto that steel penny. I only had one of those. but you're way more amazing (:. How am I so lucky?
I'm not even sure if you are lucky... I checked out your profile. and your boyfriend looks like a real loser
Yeah, I guess you know him better. and it's really what makes you happy, right?. but still.. you deserve better
plus I bet the guy wants a wallet sized photo of you.. and that's "not creepy" at all
Don't tell your boyfriend this.. but you're the prettiest girl I've ever met. so.. that's a reason to want someone in their wallet. plus he could like show you off.. or something
deserves way better?. there isn't any better. that's why I'm so surprised you even like him. I mean, the guy probably talks about himself in third person for all we know. plus.. he doesn't do a very good job at convincing you as to how perfect you are.. . he sounds really lame if you ask me
shouldn't you be telling your boyfriend that?. (I love you too, Leandra! I don't think you know how much..)
(:. It's okay
I'm sorry
(:. I've had butterflies all day . it was weird. everything I saw reminded me of you and that just made me think of how much I love you
oh, okay. I was going to get to that physics homework though. I've been doing other projects and just remembered about it
maybe I do need help.. but I'll figure it out on my own
I wouldn't want to wake you. or bother you from your 3:30 time thing
would it be okay.. if I drew you in a comic strip or two?
whoa.. you're making a comic strip too?. :D. that's so cool (:. you're so cool
and perfect. and amazing at everything :3
(:. we could go to like.. home depot and get the supplies then build the cabinet :D. sorry..
we should have a spare somewhere. probably on top of the cabinet just in case we lose the key. I wrote you this little note. but it got rained on;. on*. so I was never able to deliver it to you today
nah, I'm just some guy
in say.. 6 years time... never mind. sorry, that would be a really lame thing to say
well.. would you say "I do" in 6 years time?
yeah.. you probably won't. I guess I'm just too hopeful
mine never come true. just once
but it almost didn't happen then
it might've been for you to be my girlfriend
you know.. I have this note that I was going to give you when you were a Freshman
no, in an envelope . it doesn't matter any more, but at the time.. I wished then too. I was so nervous I couldn't say the words. so I wrote them and put them in the envelope. and I never gave you the envelope because you never gave me the chance
oh, that wish didn't come true
no, I'm talking about a different one. anyway.. thinking of that stuff is sort of making me sad.. I should probably let you get to sleep
no way
did I miss todays rainbow?
oh, yeah. must've been special
It could've been Saturday
that's how I feel. it's almost our "halfiversary" if that's important at all
so our halfiversary means nothing to you?
I felt the same way
3 years?. you've known me for that long ish
oh I guess I meant like.. we're on #3?
but for gifting purposes.. can we agree on like.. the 12th?
psh.. what timing?
what could be more important. ?*
than like.. you
so we both agree that you are super important :D
well, never mind what I was going to say. goodnight and sweet dreams :D
doesn't matter
2 years sometime in October I think
or sometime before that. I'm thinking late September
all a joke to you, huh?. I get it.. I'll just go. bye
it doesn't matter. I'm sorry for everything. and I'm sorry for thinking about past stuffs..
oh, that's the past stuffs I was thinking about. anyway.. goodnight
I'm sorry, it's inevitable 
anyway, I'll stop wasting your time. bye and sweet dreams
I'm not amazing.. but thanks
there's no way to show it. it's not there
I'll try. but not promises. sweet dreams to you too. no* promises
I don't have any rainbows :/. anyway.. bye. any other quarters you need before you go?. sorry.. you probably don't care if I try to find them
I kind of wanted to search.. but okay
you too. sorry for keeping you up. and sorry that all but one of my wishes come true
some things aren't meant to come true I guess... and no I'm not. 'night
:/
bye
just forget about it. you need to go anyway. so bye
I'm not going to waste any more of your time. so goodnight and sweet dreams
sure I am.. anyway, bye
nothing, it's not important. I'm going to just log out to save you the trouble
I'm not important to you..
goodnight, Leandra
(:. sorry :/
sorry
maybe I shouldn't have come back on. I'm sorry
I'll just leave again. it was probably better when I was gone. just like every other time... goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra
prove it?. sorry. I'm going again. I don't need that wallet photo, by the way
I don't think you care enough to 
I figured you were kidding. only I would be crazy enough to do that
I would right now.. if I didn't feel like such a bother and if I couldn't get you in trouble. but yeah, no wallet photo.. it doesn't matter. goodnight. sorry :/
so I hear..
I could totally trade you of me as a kid... although that wouldn't be too great. I'll just go again.......
you didn't do anything wrong. don't blame yourself :/
it makes me feel worse that you would blame yourself
you never mess up (:. you're perfect. and that's why I'd trust you with the cabinet to the glassware 
you wouldn't even need a key
or it could remain unlocked
I trust you enough (:. You're perfect. and broken glass means nothing
I'm still so sorry :/
but you're amazing and I love everything about you.. that's why I asked if you'd say "I do" in 6 years. which.. was silly... I'm sorry
I didn't think you thought about it at all
sorry
well I'm sorry if I do
nah, you're the amazing one. I'm just some toy you'll grow out of
that sounds nice. (:
I'm sorry if I say forever.. but I really do mean it
you know.. the only reason why I cried during Up was because I imagined us growing old n' what not. sorry if that sounds lame. and I'm sorry you only think you believe me. but I can't really do much to convince you
stuck with you?. that sounds amazing. there's no one else I'd rather be stuck with. I'm sorry. but you can call me "the boy who loves you more than anything". I'll love you know matter what. no* matter
I was waiting for that . I'm sorry :/. I fail so much. I promise you that I will do my best. sorry. I should just let you get on with stuff
I see you everyday and I fall for you a little more.. you become more perfect every time I see you. you're the best girlfriend I could ever ask for and you don't even try. I'm the luckiest guy ever
yeah, no way I'll ever get it done now without falling asleep on my textbooks. but thank you (:. I can't believe I'm so lucky. You're all I think about. like, I'm pretty sure I never found a four leaf clover until I met you. and then I couldn't stop finding them. I'm so lucky the luck doesn't even know where to go. anyway, I'm just wasting your time still. so goodnight and sweet dreams
(:. You're so perfect. goodnight
that's crazy
but your day just started . I love you so so so so much and more (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams Leandra
you're way more amazing
I don't even deserve you... sorry.. bye (:
You deserve me 130%. Bye Leandra. I may need help with that photography... but I'd hate to bother you
No way
whoa.. you better get on that then
I doubt I could be of any help. so I'll just wish you good luck. take as long as you want though
I'm so so so lame
yeah, but take as long as you need
double bye all the way
have fun, bye
what's the difference?
so that's the difference.... anyway, I shouldn't waste you time, go write your essay
t.t.f.n. I guess I won't be seeing you later.. which is okay, homework is more important
I was told you called.. so to be polite I called back.. but I understand your extremely busy. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams! (:
it's fine, I shouldn't have called.. anyway, have a great rest of you day, I'm sorry I got you in trouble :/
You should have made brownies! That would have been awesome :D. I'm still sorry though. I feel like you just waste your time with me and I just get you in trouble :/
And no matter how amazing that cabinet will be.. it doesn't make me feel better
Maybe I should make you brownies. so that I can earn some brownie points
So.. I should make more cupcakes?. !!. I bet that would make your mom happier-ish. I heard from someone that she liked those. or.. not.. . I don't know
That's awesome. Have fun then :D
I can't. I'm home alone
Yeah, it's fine. I'll just stay home . I wouldn't want to be a bother anyway
They are there. but when they were making plans to go they didn't really ask me. and since I didn't know you were going.. I didn't get a ride there when I had the chance. but being home alone isn't that bad... I'm just a little.. I don't know. but yeah, you should have fun at the game
Well like.. I had no other reason to go other than to see you there... but it's really okay, enjoy the football game. I'm sure I can find something to do. I had been sort of doing nothing in hope to get a message or something.. but I guess I can find something else to do
a message from you...
you did
a facebook message was what I was looking forward to
yeah.. now I've got nothing
I don't know where my jenga game is..
yeah, but that's over there. it's really fine. it's no fun alone anyway
yeah... but I do hope you have a lot of fun. I can't say I will. but you know.. it's whatever
really, it's fine
I wouldn't want to bother you and I've just felt like an awful person for a lot of the day. so.. maybe it's best if I'm alone
but I don't feel like it's nothing
I don't know.. something inside me is making my heart all pittery and pattery. and my stomach is sinking. and like.. it's been raining a lot 
I don't know if I can believe it.. but thanks
oh, I meant it was raining today
or at least for me.. I don't know the forecast out where you are
the rain drops like to hit my eyes mostly
no it's nothing you did. I'm just an awful person. and I'm sorry they're scary
anyway, I should let you go to the football game or something
Patrick was looking for you after I went to the buses, did he find you?
who knows.. I just haven't been able to be happy all that much. I feel like I do everything wrong. and no matter how much you tell me different..
I don't though. I got you in trouble. Patrick was upset because of me... maybe if I wasn't around you'd be fine. your mom probably thinks of me as a 'bad influence'
you don't bother me though. I never feel good enough :/
and that stuff just makes me feel less
I'll let you get to that football game
sorry for what?. you're perfect and amazing and everything
I've just never been any of that.. and it's hard to do so
no :/. You saying that it's your fault makes it worse :'(. It's like that song 'Be Gentle With Me'
My heart breaks so easily. so be gentle be gentle with me.... sorry. just.. have fun at the football game. I should probably go anyway
I don't want to get my keyboard wet... It's seriously.. not that
I just.. I hate that I get you in trouble and that I waste your time
but it bothers me :/. because it makes me to blame. http://youtu.be/66ZWaiNLigI. I really shouldn't be like this..
I guess I guess.. I can't believe that I have you. and I guess I'm worried that if I mess it up then I won't have you. and you're who I've waited for for so long. and losing you again would be the worst. so I'm just scared that I will. and it makes me sad
I'm serious about getting my keyboard wet..
I'll always want you around. but that darn club card... once you're in that club, it's hard to get out. I guess... It's sort of sad though, because the only ones in that club are you and I
It's scary.. because I'm afraid of you letting go and since we're in school I know you wouldn't hug me at all.. so I'm left guessing the entire time... and the "You broke my heart" club card. now with benefits
you left once and that's why I'm still scared :/
I know..
I'm just.. you letting go.. and.. heart. :/. and..I don't know
I just feel so far away
I don't think you reassure me when I need the reassuring
you kind of reassure me once I'm already sad..
it's okay... don't be sorry. just enjoy the game. I think I'll go to bed. because at least then I won't be crying
no, I seriously don't want you to be sorry. I just.. I want you around and I want you to cheer me up. but I don't want to bother you with nothing important
I'll probably wake up and get over it.. or something
I wish I could cheer you up more. I show up at the wrong times and I never can. :/
like last night... I should have cheered you up sooner. and I shouldn't have gotten you in trouble
it's fine. (:. sorry..
anyway, you can always try tomorrow
or something.. you're probably still in trouble because of me. Saturdays have Doctor Who
I don't really like to play airsoft
because I'm always held hostage. and I'm always used as the target
you should do it then
just.. without me..
because I've gotten tired of being the one to get shot all the time
I could even borrow my brothers paintball gun
No.. I'm specifically the target. I'm set out in the middle and shot at
I don't think you know what *target* means
I'm not supposed to run
So whenever I play now I usually just don't play. I walk around and watch everyone else. plus I don't even have an airsoft gun
it's whatever
I mean, maybe one of these days
but I don't think my dad would like it that much
like.. specifically tomorrow
that's why I said I couldn't do tomorrow..
because my dad would be upset that that's what I did with my time
Like, I could probably get away with anything but airsoft... you could tell him.. he's at the football game :P. a football game I should be letting you get to. so goodbye and goodnight
he'd probably be upset because I asked if I wanted to go earlier
or something. he'd be like "We could have given you a ride"
Oh.. no like, it's hard to explain
he's fine with airsoft. just.. not tomorrow. anyway.. have fun at the game
....... you're like.. not letting me explian. explain* . it's just, a bad day tomorrow
because I'm not doing something that my dad wanted me to do.. and if he finds out I go to airsoft then he'd think I was just making up excuses so I could go to that. plus I wouldn't have a ride, but that's just a secondary thing
you.. can't
it doesn't. it's something that once I miss it.. I miss it
I have legitimate reason to miss it. it's something that could have been nice.. but I really can't go. and you're no bother. I'm the bother. I should just leave or something
I don't know. I just can't go anymore 
it's vague for a reason..
I never get in trouble. it's weird
no.. just go to your football game and have fun without me
bye
I won't have an amazing night, but thanks. and that sounds nice. but yeah, you should have an amazing night. because I won't be involved in it.. so, yeah. I hope the game is good. bye. and goodnight. sweet dreams for later
maybe you should be worried.. have a nice time
I'm not doing anything tomorrow, just to clarify...
bye
can you check outside your window?
outside the front door
you may need to go outside for it...
one of the windows
okay
I'm the one who's sorry. and I'm sorry I just got home to see your messages
I can't make everyone happy :/
I don't know if I could speak. I can't though... because there's someone I always leave out
I stopped by.. by the way. and I made as much noise as possible... I could have been there for 15 minutes
Thank you (: You're so amazing :D goodnight and sweet dreams!!! :D. have a fantastic day tomorrow too :D. (:. that green dot is so misleading.. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I hope you're having a great day (:
Tomorrow sounds fine with me (: You're probably really busy today anyway, so it's okay :D . you're way more amazing (:. I'm afraid of wearing that watch you gave me because then I could rub that little note off of it (which I recently noticed) and I like that note because it's nice n' what not (:. mowing today just wasn't the same without you :/. oh and I meant to ask you if we ever finished the movie Up that one time. goodnight and sweet dreams, I hope I can see you tomorrow (:
Why wouldn't I be up for it? (: and I'll just play the "It's my birthday tomorrow" card.. how could they say no?. Get Low sounds like a good movie.. which is a random thing to say... sorry, have a nice day
Exactly, Robert Duvall, Bill Murray. What else could you want?
good point
you could if you wanted to.. I guess you don't want to do anything later. which is okay I guess..
I'm free whenever. like.. I'm even free right now
I wanna give you something too. I could bike over and then leave. just like.. a trade off
if you'd like.. but I could always save you the trouble
well, if you insist on it. then it's your decision 
you can show up whenever you want
I'll have to make sure you're not all ninja then o.o
I'll be waiting.. lurking in the shadows
aww.. well.. okay. I have full faith in your capability 
awesome, see you soon (:. Bye for now
I definitely did (:. It's okay
we can always finish it later. exactly :D. You're amazing (:. I wish I didn't have a paper to write about myself. because I don't have anything special to write about
it's not important
like.. its' not due yet
a college admission essay
that's pretty much what I'm supposed to do... I just don't know what to write about. and I'm not that special to write much of anything. but I know you have homework so I'll figure this out
what do you mean?. You're so special :D. You like.. volunteer all the time. you see the world and you're like "Hey, I can make you better"
I read an example essay and it's topic was bandaids 
I volunteered to spend time with you (:. Someone also wrote about their girlfriend. hmm.... no ideas there. just kidding :D. sorry. but yeah, have fun with your homework! :D. I think I still have that sheet of paper lying around. umm.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:
Are you okay?
You're so so so awesome (:
haha, the worksheet you're doing :P. which I should let you do
hmm.. I could look at mine and tell you what she's looking for
I don't think so. I mean, I was going to just further explain the worksheet
if I can find it
it's cool, thank you (:. and helping you do work will help me focus more. shucks. it's not in my notebook :/. pretty much what you should do is explain it.. as well as possible
hold on. :/
I just.. I want to help more. and.. also tell you that I love you (:
and I hope I stay that way for you (:
(:
It's probably weird and silly.. but I really don't feel squished when you're on me
Really (:. Like.. I feel more comfortable
Always comfy (:
okay, and I understand your homework a little more after looking at it again. so like.. one side shows what the british did, right?. and like.. the middle right shows what the colonists did?. Well it's like.. one side shows what the British did and why they did it and the other side shows what the colonists did and why. and you just gotta explain it enough until your point comes across
Like.. if it's the Proclamation of 1763 and there's something the colonists did against it. then you explain why the British created the proclamation . their reasoning (or rationale) and then you explain why the colonists went against it 
and it's not cheating if you like.. look up what it was . like for individual ones. like, check in the back of the book and if that doesn't help just type in "proclamation of 1763". or whichever one you're on
and read the facts about it
like.. this probably doesn't help and is a bit rusty. but.. like the Proclamation was made to protect the colonists, right?. and the colonists just thought that the British were making things more strick?. Because I think I recall Indian conflict
That sounds good
there was conflict past there and the British were afraid that the colonists weren't safe
so the Proclamation was to keep them safe until there was a more viable solution 
whereas the colonists were all like "what? I wanna live on that side of the mountains.. what's the big deal Brits?"
probably not. haha
but yeah, the colonists were like "We deserve that land"
it all goes with like.. the manifest destiny n' what not. like.. it was their "birthright" 
well I'm glad I could help you with it. but yeah, just give a few sentences until you show the teacher you have a good understanding of it. It doesn't have to be that long
which is pretty much what you need :D
I have complete faith in you (:
I trust you too :D
I love to help (:. You're more important anyway (:
(:. Well anything for you :D
I wish I could write better stuffs about myself
haha (:. You're amazing. I'll do my best 
I think I've told you pretty much my life. so you probably know all the cool (or uncool) things about me
psh.. I'm like a book. and the only pages left to read are the ones that haven't been written yet
or it's already gotten boring and you haven't noticed yet
I love every second with you (:. You're so amazng. amazing*. 86400 seconds in a day. and I could spend every second of that. and still not have enough time
yeah :D. Of course
nah. you're way cooler :D. and I can't wait to finish those movies with you (:
maybe we'll have more time to finish them all (:
(:. You're so amazing :D. but writing a paper about myself.. won't be really amazing
whoa.. that would be a lot of help (:. I wish you could find time though. I'm not really.. at the top of the "to do" list
(:. That's crazy talk
Me.. too. and you should :D. Nap and get stuff done at 3:30 (:
(:. I like napping with you :D. It's nice. maybe I should like.. wake you up at 3:30. I could call you :D. or something.. . or try to
that sounds like a good idea (:. well.. kinda
I believe in you (:
I should probably let you work instead of keeping you away from it. Who knows.. before you know it it'll be like.. 12 in the morning. and you'll be like "Darn that Peter guy.. distracting me n' what not"
You're awesome (:
I like this bracelet and sticker :D. But seriously. you're awesome. you're so special and perfect to me (:. I couldn't imagine life without you
(: I love being with you :D. You're so so so special (:. And I need to make you feel that way every day I can (:. I've been the happiest I've ever been with you (:. And I just.. I want to spend all of my time with you until you're tired of me
(:. And that's why I say 'forever'. I know you don't like that word.. but. I want it to work for you this time (:
I don't think I can be happy if it doesn't work
I trust you too (:. I trust that you won't break me heart again (:. and I just hope I can be different. and that I can be your all. or.. be your everything and give you my all. I hope I can prove it (:. sorry.. anyway, I should let you get to your homework :D. good luck with everything and I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight and have the sweetest dreams (:
I know, being like.. our halfiversary . I don't care about that day for any other reason. because you're the most important (:. It's okay you broke it the first time though.. don't hold yourself accountable for that. Don't forget, I've always been here. and I'll always be there for you (:. I kinda wanna read that thingy you wrote . Unless you want to tell me. I can wait (:. I've waiting for so long anyway . sorry.. so much spam in your inbox. I'll just go . have a great day tomorrow too (:
I missed 11:11. And I understand that you're distracted. there's more important stuffs. than I. You're way cooler. and I'm glad I waited. unlike Amy in that Doctor Who episode. anyway.. I'll stop bothering you/being in the way.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:
Me too :D. I'm in the way of the stuff you saved for last though. but yeah, you should still be able to make a  wish :D
I have to wait however
nah, I don't have it here. so no wish for me. but that's okay. I hope the hands don't get out of alignment . wish as much as you need. plus my wishes hardly come true, but maybe I'm not wishing correctly. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams and good luck :D
don't
you need it more
I'll only wish that you do well
You are the world :D. You're better than any wish . You're the bestest ever (:. See you tomorrow. LD. :D*. You're so amazing! (:
You're amazing (: And after like.. an hour or so messing with that paper, I finally got it back in cat form :D. thanks for the birthday wishes too (:
I'm so glad (: You're so amazing.. I don't know how you do it (:
Aw.. I didn't say goodnight :/ Well.. I hope you have a great rest of your day
so that's who it was..
that sounds ridiculous 
it's fine. I don't really know if I'll go out and take photos today anyway. oh, I got that thingy for you
I mean, with regulations being so strict this year... and yeah, giving you the thingy will only take a second. so.. I'll just drop it off or something. unless you're completely and utterly busy
well.. I have a valid excuse to do so
I can always leave it at your doorstep.. but it wouldn't really be.. the best place?. And I mean, I'll just be dropping it off. so.. I wouldn't take away too much of your time
well, okay (:. I'll see you for a second then
i think we can still make that short amount of time fun (:. And then afterwards we can part to our separate ways. and do our homework n' what not
I wish I didn't get so lost on the physics stuffs.. said physics stuff that should've been done by now..
yeah, that. but you've probably figured it out already
I only forgot it in there because I thought I would do it :P. but nah. I'm not efficient at all :P. well kidding.. but if like.. you know
what kinds of stuff?
I'm sure you know that :D
anyway, I'll deliver the thingy. soon. if that's alright
no time wasted. I've gotten a lot done actually. so yeah.. I'll bring the stuffs over. see you in a bit
You're so amazing (:. Thanks for the help :D. Goodnight and sweet dreams
that one place. 7 days o.o. Have fun doing stuff and I can't wait (:
haha (:
I really like it when you show up
and I'd love for you to help :D. that would be amazing (:. I l <3 ve you (:
(:. You're amazing. and I need to take photos. maybe I'll have time tomorrow between robotics. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I like hugging you. It's nice and fuzzy (:. sorry... and we'd be so cute at 30... sorry.. bye (:. You're so so so so so amazing (:
You're the most amazing person ever (:. and it's okay.. it was just a creeper photo I guess. :/ sorry.. I really wasn't kidding.... I guess Thomas the train could tell you that... sadness.. anyway, I hope you have a great rest of your day.... sorry for all of the calls :/. I'll just uh.. stop bothering you and get out of your life. I'm the worst person ever :/. so so so sorry. I'll stop with the spamming.. I'll just go and stop talking to you :/
well.. no need to be sorry. it's my fault I had an awful day. worst day ever.... I really need someone to talk to.. but it's okay.. It's not like I'm crying or anything. it's just rain . have a goodnight. I hope your day was better than mine..
I'm glad you could tell I was there. well.. okay. I don't deserve you.. 
and that would be my fault... I couldn't hear you say anything. I'm assuming your mom said no.. but have a great day anyway (:
So not amazing
changed your profile picture again? . but no, not amazing here. and my camera died :/. and no one's home to help me with the frisbee thing. such bad luck :/
it's whatever though... I should let you get on with your day
I'm probably the reason why you can't do anything.. because I get you in trouble so often
ah.. I guess so. I like your pic by the way. and my wallet is.. feeling pretty empty. just kidding. aww.. :?. :/ *. I should go... I shouldn't waste any of your time. You're probably busy
some with pictures or just random stuff?
that's be neat.. but you don't have to if you don't want to
That would be awesome
I was going to suggest us to like.. do Halloween stuff if you wanted
That'd be amazing. you're amazing (:
You're just getting wild. That would make more sense 
exactly. and you'll forget about me
psh.. no way. you're amazing :D
well a little late for that. did you know there's a sequel to Arthur? . and a third one?. I didn't know.. until just now. sorry.. random
but you're so amazing and wonderful :D. yeah, really
I kinda wanna watch them now. no like.. that Arthur Movie with that British kid
Maybe.. . I think so
yeah, there's 2
2 more at least. I would... I wouldn't want to watch them alone. but you probably wouldn't want to watch them with me.. . any way.. I should probably let you get on with stuffs. carving pumpkins sounds like so so so much fun (:. but yeah, have a good rest of you day and bye
whoa.. that'd be awesome (:. I'd love that even. if we ever finish that list that's already out there. sorry.. 
so much fun (:
Me neither. but it sounds like fun (:. Anyway, bye for now (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams if I can't say it later. and.. I.. I love you (:. sorry... but yeah (:
No, thank you (:. Bye (:
You're so amazing and perfect. and special to me . (:. Tah tah :D
I'm not amazing, but thanks
You're perfect for me. and I just want to spend forever with you..
I don't know why I wouldn't want to. it's okay. But I mean it. it sounds the greatest. and I'd love to spend all of that time with you (:. Even if we're doing nothing . or if we just paint a cabinet . so.. bye (:
Bye Leandra, I love you so so so much . and I really like you too
(:. :D
sorry
so sorry
Maybe not enough.. but I guess so
I know. rainbow cake is nice. You're nice (;. (: *. I'm pretty lame though
It is, do you have any camo?
I have a hat you could borrow?. Or a jacket? :D
yeah... I mean, I don't need that much camo. I was just going to wear the bdu's. and and.. umm.. when do people need to help with the float?
sounds exciting (:. I'd like to help. and the bdu is the pants
yeah, I could let you wear the jacket and maybe the hat . if you'd like
awesome (:. unless you're being sarcastic 
awesome (:
if you say so. but it's just my jacket
You pull off everything perfectly (:
my sweater still sort of smells like you
No, you're so amazing. and I'm sorry.. that might be creepy :/. But yeah, you're so so so so so so pretty (:. And if you wore camo then like... everyone else wouldn't be doing it justice. except for commandos . and army soldiers. sorry :/
Like.. how could someone as pretty as you like someone not as great
?*
pshh, no way. I'm.. kinda excited to work on the homecoming float
and excited for pumpkin carving
That's how I feel (:
Whoa, that sounds exciting. mostly.. the second part. I guess?. I don't know. Have fun with that (:. you're so amazing. and if you need like.. supplies for the float, I may be able to pull something . together*. Maybe. I dunno. but yeah, have fun and goodnight (:. sweet dreams too (:. You're so so so so so so amazing and perfect for me (: I love you so much.. and I'm sorry for saying it so much over facebook
(:
It's completely okay. Thank you for liking me (:. I have cardboard.. but I don't know how that helps
Okay, cool (:. You're so amazing. and I really really like you (:. And you're super cute . I like your profile picture :D. sorry

You're way more amazing
Just.. you?

yeah, I thought it sounded cool
I'll tell you about it later (:. Have fun with stuffs! :D
Goodnight and sweet dreams
I won't
Super sweet dreams (:
You're so sweet and amazing and special and pretty and just everything I've ever wanted and more (:. sorry.. but yeah, bye (:

Haha. that's awesome (:
Anyway, I guess I'll go take some photos and fix my bike. and I'll let you get on with your day
I'll try to make it fun.. I'm pretty much alone. and the cold weather isn't going to be great when fixing my bike, but I gotta get to it eventually. and since I have nothing better to do.. . but yeah, I hope you have a bunch of fun. (:
it's okay
I hope.. but I don't wanna get my hopes up. sorry... you're way more amazing. have fun (:. Bye. I love you (:. sorry..

Nah.. not me
You're the cool one (:
I don't know about it.. but I hope it is too. I had a dream about you last night.. if that's not creepy
I think I missed you so much
It's not creepy
yeah
I've missed you a lot. sorry
me? Cool?. no way. aww.. I still miss you :/. sorry. I should probably let you get on with your day
I'll just have to miss you more n' stuff
Oh, it's fine. you can hold onto it for longer
awesome. I'll just pick it up whenever is best for you
It's silly. all I know is you looked really pretty 
haha, that's silly. aww.. I'm sorry. I should have stayed longer. or maybe I should walk over.. just so you can find out what happens next
I've got a pretty warm sweater (:. oh, and okay
You're even better. I'm sorry,, but I think I'm going to be gone for about 20 minutes or so. sorry :/. I still miss you.. but bye
Aww.. :/. I took longer than I had hoped and now I think I lost my chance to talk to you.... I hope you have a great day.. and I hope that I can manage whatever I've got ahead of me... I like you too and you're the best ever.. I'm so sorry :/ have a really nice day doing whatever you do. sorry again.. I probably shouldn't bother you any longer
I can't mow today
and by "stuff ahead" I meant whatever I find . I love you so much too (:. sorry
I don't have anything to do.. I was just saying, ya knwo?. know*
Yeah.. I guess?
(: ?
I would like that. if like.. that was okay.. maybe
you're way more amazing though (:
awesome (:
you? yah
You're the dream of my eyes
or.. sorry, that sounded weird. sorry :/
You're so amazing
I wish I could have dreamt a little longer
My dream was so unreal.. I don't think it could ever happen in real life
no. it was just.. too good to be true
Just.. silly stuffs. all I know is you looked really pretty (:. and you were smiling a lot
nah, that's silly. but it was nice while it lasted
I wish
awesome (:
You're so amazing (:. :D !!. I hope today
but then again.. hoping is sad. but yeah, I was just about to say
Have fun with stuffs. So much fun (:. the stuffs I should let you get to. so yeah, have fun, and bye for now (:
but the florist? . you get to smell all the pretty flowers :D
the flowers that aren't as pretty as you though (:
No way, you're the prettiest most wonderful person ever (:
When I'm with you.. it feels like your the only person in the world
and with all the cheese... I could make a pretty good sandwich

aw.. okay. bye, Leandra (:
I love you too. (:. Bye for now :D
I very much think that. do you think.. that you'd still want to see me?
we can wait for pumpkins (:
we could even go to that pumpkin patch or something?. Go through the corn maze and grab a pumpkin. ya know?. unless that sounds silly. I haven't done that since like.. 4th grade maybe?. (I mean in the future, by the way). but yeah, that all sounds like fun (:. if that's what you want to do . or.. something. I don't know :/
so awesome. and Doctor Who is on tonight.. but you might not find that so great
yeah. but I'm fine with anything (:. I just sort of mostly want to see you 
well.. I'm free whenever
neat (:
I could go find you too
(:. Just like camping :D
You have really good ideas. (:
well I like this one (:
And I'll try with all of my might to make it turn out perfectly. just like you (:. You're so perfect :D
you can say that..
but you'd be ying. lying*
haha, (:. Nice way to use my typo :D. I
I'll just be your balance (:
Maybe only together we're perfect. well... more like.. . You're always perfect (:
But.. you make me perfect?

You are mine (:. if you want
and even though I don't deserve to even ask... I want to be yours too (:
You are everything, what else do I need?
Just get a tortilla.. and wrap yourself in it. boom.. instant everything burrito
it couldn't be simpler 
a sleeping bag would suffice, ya know?. that's burrito-y. :D. tortilla-esque . if that works (:
exactly :D
!!. That's not a bad idea
you and these good ideas (:. just like.. move like a caterpillar . or waddle like a penguin 
hop up and down
don't even have to cut a hole in the bottom
we should do one some day (:. Just like.. everything you've never done before. some day. (:
I'd love to help (:. anyway.. you sure you want to see me today?
kosher? 
I mean.. I could get you a bunch of pickles
http://www.hellagoodbuys.net/shoppe/viewitem.php?category=Music&item=M005
well I'm ready whenever you are
Do you already have it?
Well, hey.. I can let you borrow my copy. so you don't have to wait for it
so that way.. you can have it then get it?. if that makes sense. so you can listen to it before it comes over your way
I was thinking of buying it for you though. because it's like.. 100 pennies. 10 dimes. 20 nickles. 4 quarters. and 1 more other thing
whoa, yeah :D
well, of course. sorry
if only
not as cool as you though. sorry... I should stop saying stuffs
I could even stop bothering you too
just go.. n' stuff
oh.. umm. yes. if you want
I'm not picky. whatever is phine :D
whoa.. mac n' up the cheese. I mean.. with all of the cheesy things I've said. all you really need is the mac. and with all the corny/lame jokes..
we could have a side of corn
yeah. Hey.. would you like me to bike over or something?. 5 hours goes by so quickly with you. so.. I dunno
alright, neat?. Should I need a sleeping bag?
I would think so. maybe. and wouldn't want that though
I'll take the kids :D
aww... I want the kids one. it'd be better than the one I've got
it's huge
crazy.. . !!
ahh.. kids size? Blues Clues? or Dalmations?. that's a tough one... and the huge one is really warm. but bulky. should I still bring one?
alright, I'll be super fast :D. bye for now. see you soon (:
You're so amazing and pretty and perfect and just everything I've ever wanted and more (: sorry.. but that's you (: goodnight and sweet dreams (and let me know when float stuffs need to get done) sleep really really well :D

yeah, oh well

I love you too (:
It's okay (:. You're amazing. I can't remember if it's a new Adventure Time tonight or not. oh and tomorrow.. is that day. (:
I'll be excited anyway (:. You're so cool :D
aww well.. okay. I guess getting excited for like a week seems pointless now
which is okay, of course. my bad. So since you feel bad about eating that cake.. does that mean I have to get it or something?
whoa.. that sounds amazing :D
me neither. but it sounds good (:
It'd be pretty special especially with you (:
thanks?. I just doodled them, they're not that special
I liked that one (: It looks really cute :D. and we can name one Wallace?
"oh totally" doesn't sound convinced
but okay... well any dog is fine by me
if you say so
yeah (:
(:. sounds nice. oh la la I'm fallin' in love; it's better this time than I've ever known
Ah, just me quoting a song. not too special
Well, Foster the People
who does Pumped Up Kicks :D. I'm scared to touch the bracelet.. I could break it more :/
Could I drop it off after robotics?
or.. do I have to make an appointment?
that's so crazy
WHOA. and I'm designing a Doctor Who shirt
nah.. nothing like that. just a design
Look at me I'm wearing a vegetable
yup
Hey guess what
I was going to say that I love you. but that would be interesting too (:
(:
I love you bunches too. color for what?
I didn't think people got those for people on homecoming. But okay, thanks. I'll see you later if things work out well (:
Like.. I don't know. I'll get you a corsage n' stuff (:. just so you can try that whole pinning thing again?
haha (: Okay. Bye for now (:. You're so perfect :3

don't be sorry (:. you're amazing. eres tu. sorry :P
You're so amazing :D. ttfn
I really really like you too (: . and you too :D. bye (:
aww :/. I told myself not to be disappointed the entire way home.. but I am still. and I really wanted to wear that bracelet tomorrow :/ but that's not as important. I guess you fell asleep.. so goodnight and sweet dreams
okay
I should have thrown that pebble
aw?. I'm sorry
Aw, it's okay
You're crazy, I love you (:
How could you lose me?. I'm yours (:
That's also very unrealistic. just ask Theodore.. . I told him how much I loved you all day. and how lucky he was to spend so much time with you (:
It would be awesome (:
I can't wait for the day (:. Should I let you sleep some more?
Nah, I'm alright (:. Plus I love talking to you :D. But.. I am kinda hungry :/. So that could impede on the talking to you
exactly . but that's okay
No, you don't have to go through the trouble. even if I really want to see you
It's fine (:
and don't worry about losing me either.. that was just so random
no way (:. I'm the one worried about losing you
plus having me in the first place isn't so great
and I'll make sure to keep you and love you with all of my heart. "I'll always have a stronger hold"
I've never heard that before (:. But it sounds really nice :D. aww.. I had no time to get an ugly sweater
So I've heard
I'm okay, thanks though (:
That's what I wanted. that or a cat one. (:. Oh.. I want one with super glue on it. so if you hugged me, even for a second...
I'll never let go (:
that's not letting go. that's just letting the leash get longer
I'm pretty sure we both know who's walking who. just kidding. but I walked a dog once. and it was twice my size. and it dragged me for a few blocks
well better get practice now. because one day.. 
you may have to (:
You're so fun (:
I love.. you (:. sorry... but yeah (:. the stuff with you is fun too (:. I just love everything about you. and I won't let go and you don't ever have to worry about losing me. I.. I may still have to worry
and I love you for you (:. Oh, and guess what. You're super cute too. sorry. you probably already knew that..
nah, I'm nothing special. but you too. I guess you're going to bed.. so goodnight and sweet dreams
well, okay... it's not important though. but thanks (:. You're amazing
and I think you're super special and I love everything about you. and you're so so so so perfect (:. sorry.. . bye (:
it's okay if you do. because I'm honestly not that great
but you really and truly are the best girl ever (:
I don't even know how I got this lucky.. but I'm pretty sure having me doesn't make you that lucky. having you makes me super lucky though. and I just find four leaf clovers because of you
I must not give that much luck
four leaf clovers aren't even lucky now that I've got you
because how much more luck do I need?
nah, that's silly. but I should let you get to sleep. and.. I love you so so so much (:. bunches :3. And you're so perfect. and I.. never mind... but I may.. sort of be bleeding right now. by accident. so... I should let you sleep and get a bandaid . sorry for rambling
nah.. I hit my elbow that already had been hurt. and it just opened up again
aww. what I said didn't send. oh well :/. pst... I love you.. Goodnight (:
go for it
okay, goodnight. Hey, you're amazing and goodnight (: sweet dreams.. and I hope that I don't look too silly if I show up dressed up and you don't :P
nah. that couldn't be me :P
it sounded good. is that a no to Kim Possible?
oh I was.. just thinking you could wear a normal shirt... but f you want to do Mario. I can look for stuffs. if*
I needa find a phone that is wireless
no like.. a home phone. just with no wires
so I can take it with me :D. unless you were saying you needed to go
okay, lemme get a phone then D. :D *. and I can call you?
just so you know that I've gotten ahold of one. talk to you soon then (:
sorry :/ goodnight and sweet dreams. I never said goodnight and sweet dreams :/. so.. goodnight and sweet dreams :D
hello

I wish I could see you earlier too.. I'll try to wait though. it's hard though. and you're so so so perfect. I should probably let you get to stuffs before though
A perfect day just for you (:. well.. I may have just jinxed it now. I'll try though.. to make it perfect. knowing me though.. I'll mess it up somehow
a jinx as in.. whatever I said reversed what will actually happen. but no, I'm not amazing. you are though (:
but then ya can't talk. haha, why?
awesome :D
just chill in there and relax or something. Hey.. I was wondering.. should I bring a jacket?. In case it gets cold and you want one? (:
okay, neat (:. Should I let you get to stuffs?
You're cooler
oh.. well I was just saying. you could do some fun stuffs and I could let my sister on the computer (because she wants on). Plus I can wait to ruin your perfect day
I have no idea.. . I could order a pizza and watch Princess Bride with you
no way (:. I've got nothing planned for the day just for you :D
my day is focused around you, so it's all what you want to do (:
I would want to (:
Have fun for now then (:

I'm proud of you too (:. thanks so much (:
You're beautiful. Oh.. I wrote a song.. which sounds lame. and cliche. but I wrote another one
I should sing it for you sometime.. but my singing voice isn't that great
but not better than Aladdin. aww.. I love you (:. sorry..
you're so amazing.. and I'm soooo lucky. I loved dancing with you too (:. It was amazing. you were amazing. it was weird..
everyone else's face faded away in a blur and only yours remained
the crowds face faded in a blur and only remained yours (all rhyme-y). ish. that was lame
and I saw you were typing something?
to ask?. aww.. you're going to bed already?
okay (:. it's okay. :D
Goodnight and sweet dreams . and talk to you soon
okay (:. it's like the toaster game. Good morning (: I hope you have a marvelous day :3 You're so amazing :D 
haha, that's crazy talk. sorry.. you're probably not there.. so.. yeah, have a good day (: I think I'll start mowing or something
do you really want to?
oh and I brought up Kodachrome in the car today.. and both my brother and father started to sing simultaneously 
I'm listening to it now. I've actually heard it before
so.. the actor I think your dad sounds like is like.. Fred Willard
kinda
maybe
I don't know.. I think it was someone else or something. sorry
if you wanted to. I wouldn't want to waste all of your day
I'd love to. that's a crazy thing to say
I.. I don't know. I'm bad with that sort of thing
I just know.. that I'd love to see you :3
I fell asleep in church today... and I don't know what to think about the dreams I had
it's lame stuff
I just left to another room
maybe I can tell you about it later
when can* I?
wear shoes. ?*. or for the date?. You can wear whatever you like for that
okay. you're pretty cool
if you want to. we can do stuffs before we mow if you like. if you wanted to mow in the first place
awesome (:
I found Doctor Who online.. we could watch that?. I just want to spend time with you. and we could finish Princess Bride. and do Physics. and eat somewhere random. and mow. and something
you sure you want to?
Do you need help digging holes?. but okay, so we can do stuffs?
aww.. okay
sure?. You're going to be helping me a lot, it'd only be fair
so much fun (:
We could be like the guys from Holes :D
:D !!!. exactly (:
someone told me once that they used ":P" for sarcasm . so now I can never tell if you mean anything or not
but have you seen the eyes?
It looks so sad
yes
well, okay

but I want you to pick
aw... how much time do you have?
oh, okay (:. then.. I can come pick you up or?

that's 2 hours
let's watch something then
aw.. I just.. I don't know. I can just let you stay home
it's fine
I just. I don't know. :/
I don't want to waste your time. and I wouldn't be able to talk to you as much. I guess it's selfish of me..
I don't know.. you sound busy, I'll just let you do stuff
yeah :/
just do stuffs
that'll take longer than 2 hours
no, just.. . just do what you need to do :/
It's.. fine. I can do it on my own :/
tear?
aww . I'm sorry
it's my fault, don't be sorry
of course.....
It's more of a.. I would prefer doing different stuffs
but.. I guess it's a no... which should be okay for you right?. Seeing how I'm not that great. and that you saw me a lot yesterday
me too...... but it's okay
there's always some other time..
could we what?
aww.. I just. if you want
I can't stop you
I'd like you here..
I just.. I don't know

and I wanted to do that stuff with you
I never said that I already had stuff. but okay
I'll get out of your way anyway
It's fine.. I think you made up your mind
and by fine I mean, you don't have to
because you seemed pretty insistent 
no you're not
I want to see you, you just seemed pretty insistent on not seeing me.. which is.. okay I guess I can't force you into anything
I love you too, Leandra (:
And I hope you do as well (:. I felt really warm :3. so thank you for that (:. you make everyday so perfect.. and I'm glad that I know you can continue to
It's a shirt. but you can have me forever (:. and that's why I felt so warm . It's like.. not even cold outside because of you (:. And I hope you saw me waving to you under that street light. thank you so so so much (:. I'm glad I got to spend so much time with you. using me for labor is a great excuse to keep me around (:
they don't (:. I'm sorry though, you insisted on helping. I love you too!. I was making heart shapes . I don't know if you could see that.. but I tried (:
it's okay. it's dark n' whatnot . I was glad I was able to (:
Thank you so so so much (:. I see homecoming photos! (:
You look so cute :3
I don't know. the new thing in the news feed. it said you liked some photos. and I see them. and you look gorgeous 
haha, I think he was more concerned over photos of you. I'm tempted to like every photo of you
I mean, I do like them. but I mean, hit the facebook button
I see myself as a super hero
You look even awesome-er 
You're way cooler (:. and I love you (:
All of your photos are beautiful . I want one right in my wallet . sorry..
You're so beautiful (:

really?
well, okay
I'll make sure to get a really good one
nah, that's crazy talk. 2 photos.. of you.. liked. (:. You're soooo pretty (:. I can't believe how lucky I am
You're so cute when you're all yawn-y. because it means you'll fall asleep. and it was nice holding you when you slept. if that.. doesn't sound creepy. you're so perfect. I love everything about you. but I will let you go to bed. you're amazing, you know that?
can't wait for what?
I'm glad I'm yours too :3. Well I must be amazing if you'd keep me. but it's hard to see from this angle
I'm sure it's a different song somewhere. but okay (:. I love you so so so much (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams. with love,  Peter (that guy who loves you a lot)
See you tomorrow (I'll totally be in what I wore to homecoming, unless you wouldn't like that)
It's okay (:. You'll look gorgeous anyway
I love you too, Leandra (:. you should tell your dad that I listened to kodachrome and that it's stuck in my head right now
haha, I'm not sure if I am good like that though. but I will try my best (:
haha
He'd be like "So.. look up Kodachrome?" and you'd be like "Dad.. that was a month ago...". I hope that's how it happens :D. anyway, I should let you sleep (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams, I love you so much, Leandra (:
it's okay
You're cute (:
And you're cute with you doze off

Really?. What you want?. that's.. crazy
okay, I'll grab my stuff then. and I may take a little time because I'm not finished staining something
understood
wood. and I love you too (:
I wish I had a drill
Whoa, really?. I mean.. I think my brother has one somewhere around here. he could always show me where it is at some point. but then again.. I don't know. I wanna get it done soon. Oh, and my brother said that welding the thingy would be best . and that he could do it. but like, he'd probably take a while because he's busy. but he said within the week
I made him aware of it. he said if he got the chance to look at it he could figure out the best solution. but so far he told me that welding it would be the best option so far. if you lent me the pieces I can have him look at it tonight 
okay, neat (:. I'll see you soon after I take care of some stuff. if you don't mind waiting
don't be :P. it's just me... anyway, bye
I love you too (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams
smiles
it's okay. it's not true.. but okay. you're the best girl ever. and thanks so much (:. For that cd n' everything
anything I get in the mail.. I'll blame you for it. plus you knew I wanted this cd..
so I'm blaming you. so thank you (:
Wild Blessed Freedom?. I'm listening to it now. took my a while to open it
most likely
nah, that's not me
how would you know?
that's crzy. crazy*
maybe
I like you too (:
aw.. well that's okay, right?
It's probably just all in the book. plus your mom is probably tired of you spending time with me
anyone and everyone could get tired of me
you.. should?
yes. that :D
it's crossed mine. o.o. just kidding though. Don't eat it and die
but but... you could die :'(. awww. I never gave you the sandwich :/. I really meant to :/. and now it's all squished 
umm.. umm.. do you still want it?
aww.. it's not..
aww.. I can't even leave it at your door or something?
I made it just for you :/
Can I? (:
That's okay. I just want to give you the sandwich (:
So.. can I?
psh.. the jam would soak straight through the bread. plus.. for a split second.. an amazing second. I get the see the most beautiful thing ever. and that's worth it
maybe I should have said "most beautiful girl ever"
thanks... I may have changed my mind then...
oh.. sorry. :/. sorry
nah. that's not me. anyway.. I'll leave you a sammich . if you want it
yeah, I'll "brb"
who said I was saying 'goodbye'?. I said "brb". :P
okay, awesome. I'm going to send this sandwich to someone really fast and then get home and do the same. yeah.. sorry
yeah. you have fun too. :/
haha, it couldn't be too great, but thank you (: Goodnight and sweet dreams (just in case)
I can't wait (: You're amazing :D and.. I love you so so so much :3
I love you too (:. sorry. you were just... sorry. aw.. and I just missed you :/. sorry
if you say so... but I still don't see a green circle. so I don't believe you
whoa. you don't have to go through all of that trouble
maybe. good idea
awesome :D
I guess.. have fun with that
I was just using photoshop and thinking about going to the duck pond or something. mostly because I had bread that I could feed the ducks
I'd invite you, but you sound busy/keen on downtown
well I'm not that great. but seeing how it just started there could be time for everything?
There are 2 inflatables. kettle corn. a band. and a few food vendors . and by a few.. I mean I may have seen one. but it could have gotten more
that would have been awesome :D. Oh, hey.. you're amazing
Nah, I'm not amazing
not really
nah. anyway, I shouldn't waste your day
You've got stuff ahead of you
it doesn't. I just don't know why you'd want to spend your time with me and not someone else. because like.. I'm nothing special
You sure??
No, that I'm amazing. I want to be your boyfriend, if you're okay with that
I can't get over that ":P". I don't know why
sorry. it's hard to please everyone on facebook. some people want me to talk one way and others another way. I'm sorry
(")>. <(")
sorry
if you wanted. because I'd like to
neat (:
okay. umm.. you sure you want to?. You don't sound to enthusiastic about it..
It's okay
that word and the tongue face . I'm free now. or whenever. all the times
It's cool (:
I used it a lot before.. but someone got mad at me . we can meet anywhere. I can meet you at your house and give you a surprise :D
like I said.. I did it a lot but someone got really mad at me. I didn't say it makes me mad
anyway, we could do stuffs?
And I can surprise you at your house. and then we can do stuffs after that
if you wanted
aw.. that's okay
so.. you don't want to do anything then?. I guess.. that's okay
that's fine. I didn't really want to go anyway (:. I just thought that.. if I didn't have anything else to do.. I could go there and be alone or something
That sounds like fun (:. I can meet you at your house if you wanted (:
(:. See you soon then :D. are you free now?
awesome (:
see you really really soon (:
bye :D. You're amazing and goodnight (:
You're way more amazing (: and I'm sorry too :/. I'm also sorry that I missed you :/ I hope you're having a good day n' such. aww.. sorry again
I like you too
It's me . just me 
It's a cannon, right?. For the tech game?
I guess that means tech scored a point
exactly. It's really cold
I'm sorry. If only I was there. I could keep you warm. sorry..
not right now I'm not. I was watching holes earlier. I think it's still on. but I never finished it :/
Crazy. I was watching it all.. but I just never finished. mostly because I came in here during the commercial. and I felt like talking to you would be more fun
Me too
That's the best part. so.. did you want to be Batman and Robin more.. or Woody and Buzz?. sorry
I've been putting more thought into Robin and Batman. and I feel like a Buzz Lightyear costume could be hard to make
yeah, you could have the whole summer to work on it and then boom. you're ready
exactly
Yes :D. I would help you make it too. if you wanted the help, of course
not on dvd. I may have a few episodes on VHS
Are we going original Batman?. I don't know how I'd feel about the Robin costume in that case
me in no pants?. I'm not sure I'd want to see that..
Oh.. yeah, I know. I was kidding. It's really corny
if you were wondering
You're talking about the cartoon?. Oh... I was talking about Adam West n' whatnot. So.. is Batman what you'd want to dress like?
Awesome. I'll get ready on the Robin costume then :D
Being your sidekick sounds like the greatest thing on Earth
haha, nah. that's crazy. oh, and if you need help with your costume. I can always help
awesome (:. Mine won't be too great. but I'll try just for you
haha, I don't know how to use one :P

Holes is over.. I think

Doctor Who in 25 minutes.. you should totally watch it

I think all you'd need would be like.. black or grey pants and the same for a shirt
do you have either of those?
I'm sort of sketching it
me too (:
like.. Catwoman?
I have no idea. I wish I could have gotten to see you today. But I suppose I need to get used to it
so.. grey or black?. gray*
Yeah, I gotcha.. seeing me too much anyway
that is. is it going to match the pants by chance?
I've got an idea for your mask
I'd like to show you what I've sketched, if you like
the shirt and pants can be interchangeable . and I can help you with the cape, mask, and gloves
you finished with the costume?. already?. aww.. 
I was hoping to help you :/
it's okay, you don't need my help. I see you have it all covered
Well.. I hope I can save the day :D. I'll show you what I've got done someday . I'll let you get to stuffs in the mean time. Talk to you later hopefully. bye

because I miss you
and talking to you is amazing
and mostly.. I love you

haha, it's really fine. I hope I can help you with your costume at some point

I would like to see you. but you don't have to if it's too out of the way
well.. if you say so. I'll see you soon then?

and it was a gift for you.. so.. sorry. bye
tied up in what?
It was.... for you. sorry
I just don't do anything right
I just got home and I'm home alone.. so I'm not tied up with anything. I'm just a little cold
I don't know.. I was going to deliver something really fast. I mostly came inside to get a jacket
just to a house. someone cool lives there
You're the coolest, but no. You don't have to. I don't know why.. but I really want to watch Tarzan . I don't know if I have it or not though. but since I'm home alone I thought I could do that after delivering the stuffs
yeah. it's great
yes. I think I'll watch it later. I wish not alone, but what else would I do?
I mean later when I get back home
they were let outside, I don't know where they are
I don't even know... but you wouldn't want to watch it with me... I'm lame
anyway, I'm going to be right back
why would you be?. and.. why would you want to?
sounds like a good day for you..
but today was the most sunshine in forever. and the warmest. so a day without me sounds pretty good
that's silly. you didn't appear to have missed me at all
crazy..... anyway, I'm off to deliver that stuff
goodnight and sweet dreams if I don't make it back
no.. 
just saying
the dramatic effect?. I was just saying that it could happen. especially tonight
I won't be... but thanks...
I don't know why you'd care anyway

all of it
yeah, you do. your mom said so
it's fine, I'm not as fun as studying
Me too. oh well

that's just crazy talk. but yeah, you should go off and do fun stuff :D
same thing, right?. I'm going to get the fabric stuffs soon anyway. I really would have liked to have seen you today.. or talked to you more.. which is probably silly. but I just think you're the most perfect person ever and seeing you is really... amazing (: 
whoa, crazy. I could just get what you need while I'm out there :D. I could even use it as an excuse to see you by "delivering" it to you . sorry.. that sounds silly
yeah, you're mom probably wasn't fond of that last night
but yeah, just tell me what to get. I can totally do it :D
why not?
It wouldn't be trouble. I'm going over there anyway. :D
No worries (:. Just let me know what fabric you need
is your costume blue and black?
oh, so like.. blue on the inside?
Yeah. Blue on the outside would work too. I guess
depends on which batman you're doing
I don't know, it kinda matters in a way. like.. kinda. like I don't even know
because a blue cape/blue boots/blue gloves means you gotta wear grey . or.. something. I don't know. It's all up to you though
I don't know your plan.. so I can't really help without being filled in. anyway, I should probably go to the store now.. I don't want my mom to become impatient or anything
oh that's fine :D
thanks (:
it's no problem at all (:. anything for you
you're precious 
sorry
You're so lovely. anyway, bye for now (:. I love you (:. sorry.. . bye

Nah..
It wasn't too fun without you. but I got things done alone. I sort of got it done so that I'd have more time for other stuffs
oh.. yeah. I mostly did it because you asked if I wanted to do something today. but you're right. school tomorrow and stuffs.. you probably have no time or anything
I do. if you wanted
I think I would like to shower though.. to get rid of the grass smell

Just for you (:. I hoped you'd like it
It was great :D
Kinda tasted like sesame though
You're perfect
Was there sesame?
flaxseed?. hmm.. that might be it
me neither. aww.. you're so perfect (:. and.. super cute :3
nah
awww... okay
it's fine. I can let you sleep. It's all late n' what not. and you probably have stuff to wake up for. like.. 425
4:25*
If I get to a phone I can call. if that's okay with you. and yes.. that alarm clock
okay, bye then (bye here at least). expect a call. your phone or house phone?. Umm.. I'll go with your phone.. I don't know why I asked
Yeah, it'll take me a few seconds to get to the phone. so yeah, talk to you soon (:. or.. you know... I could just let you fall asleep. plus talking to me isn't that great. there's always someone else you could call. whoa.. good morning. sorry
It's cool
and I was just ejecting my usb
because I forgot to last night. nah
know anyone.. like what do you mean?
I wish I could help. but I don't really know many speakers
I know.. people. and I know people who can talk
but official?. no
Oh.. Elliot Yamin?. So you mean like.. famous people?. I thought you just meant.. someone
hmm.. well that could be difficult too. well.. just ask a bunch of people. Didn't they get football players last year?. I think if you got like.. local famous-y people.. they would be cool with it
Well.. maybe I meant like.. different football players. I also meant.. that. yeah. umm.. Mike Posner is coming to town. in.. not to long :p. actually. I think he might be in town soon. ask him then
haha
haha, really?
Bill Cosby is also coming in town. but.. it might be hard for him to say yes
I was hanging downtown one weekend. so I see names
but like.. you could ask him to come back. that's what I was saying. sorry.. probably not helpful
Whoa, that would be pretty cool. but the question was a bit random. but.. I'd like to (:. I wanna do anything with you
Especially since you'd be there
Yeah, let me make a conference . and I just said I wanted to. silly :3
whoa, that's a lot of awesomeness . I know you do
I heard Foster the People was playing at some point
and I think those bands aren't so bad. It sounds amazing. and shouldn't you be studying for something?. my teacher said.. when preparing take a 30 minute break after studying for a long period of time. just watch tv, take a walk. Just relax for a lil
nah, I'm all lame. haha, seriously though. take a break at some point. I was told it's better. plus.. you store stuff as you sleep. so get a good amount of sleep tonight
and.. breakfast is good too. a good one
good :D
when will you wake up?. because a good amount of sleep is super important, don't forget. wait.. that's good actually. sorry
I'm sorry for being all like "do this, do that"
yeah, 5 sounds great. I just wanna make sure you do great (:
Yeah, good luck and everything
I wish I had another good luck thingy to give you. but I'm not sure
okay, neat. I love you (:
haha.. a "good luck hug" sounds out of order . haha, I'm glad it guards your bed :D. All the silly stuff I give you
okay, bye (:
You too! :D
Good luck again
and I finished formatting too :D. so good timing (:
I love you so much (: Goodnight and sweet dreams
whoa. No way. plus they aren't home
I love you so much (: and I just need to pick up the phone better. Goodnight and sweet dreams :3
It's crazy, I don't necessarily have to today :P But thanks for the thought (: I sort of wish that.. I don't know... there is a hayride tonight at my church and it has a good opportune time to roast marshmallows.. but I suppose it's just wishful thinking
I didn't go because I would have liked it if you had been there. :/
oh yeah, that's due tomorrow.. I won't try and be in the way then.. I'll just stay away from the phone n' such. so yeah.. goodnight and sweet dreams.. and, I love you, Leandra. sorry.. 
you don't have to. You should do your homework. because it's more important (:
well.. okay. but only for a little bit. I want you to do you homework. your*. sorry. because I shouldn't be your priority
you sound excited :P
I am
okay, will do
oh, okay
who's phone?. yours?. okay... my facebook died on me. I should let you get to your homework..
but it's not
You don't have to
sorry. have fun with your poster. :/
goodnight and sweet dreams
no reason. well.. maybe a reason. just not a good one
Are you sure?. about.. loving me?. because.. It doesn't sound like you want to say it. and you don't say it that much. sorry.. don't answer that. I'll just go and let you do your homework. I'm sorry. bye
G'night cutie pie :3
I love you so much (:. Bye. Hello (:. Don't know if you're still there. but saying hello is nice in its own :D
nah, of course not . :3. You're cute. sorry
I like being with you too (:. sorry.. I forgot that water in that cup holder
whoa, really?. well.. at least the cup is going to a good home. I'm going to miss the thing. treat it well
haha. it's like.. you disowned your own just for mine
Our country needs strong cup. not one that cries. :P. Oh no.. I forgot. I think I need to get stuffs done because I wasn't there today. but umm.. umm.. you can call really quick.. if you wanted
Water is good
I have history. stuffs. and since it's my dad.. ya know...
aw, darn.. not that too. I forgot about that
It's okay
it's sort of.. not really due due. Like.. I actually have a lot of what I need to get done. and the other thing is optional
aww..
I thought you were going to call... but okay
You can, if you want
okay (:. I was scared that you weren't
Goodnight Leandra (:. I love you :3. Sweet dreams n' such :D
/sigh/. I hope your day is well
aww... I missed you :/. the funny thing is I knew I would :/. mowing isn't too fun without you and when it's cold out. but you too.. good day n' such . sigh :/. You probably don't understand how disappointed I am right about now, but you probably don't care anyway. well.. yeah.. have fun . :/. sorry for spamming your inbox.. it's just.. something I was looking forward to and now I'm all alone.. and it isn't to great :/. and you don't care.. but that's okay.. I suppose I'll say goodnight and sweet dreams early tonight. I really miss you, and that sounds silly, so I'm sorry.. but I don't know why it's a crazy feeling.. but I hope your day was fantastic and that tomorrow will be just as good.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:  sorry for saying stuffs.. I want to say more, but I won't.. sleep well :3. sorry for.. stuffs
I'm okay.. how are you?
cold too
I suppose so
I'm still sorry for stuffs
stuffs I said. It was all silly. and you wouldn't care
never mind. it's not important. anyway, you probably have a lot of stuffs to do.. so I'll get out of the way
Oh you don't have to
I would be.. but you could probably find a better use of your time
boom, you could do that. You've got a pumpkin already
which is nice. but doing it with me wouldn't be any fun
psh.. I spent all of last night alone. and let me tell you...
it wasn't that fun
But like.. that was me being alone. you being alone could be amazing. and I would. but why would you want me to?
that's silly
okay. That's okay*. I dropped my hopes a while ago
I don't know... I just didn't want them high n' what not
yeah, oh well. and you're not a letdown . I just didn't want to have my hopes high and have nothing happen
pretty cool. if you still care about me next year
you sure you'd want me to?
why?. I'm not special
well.. okay then. my hopes are back down
It's okay
You don't have to
Me too.. but it's okay. There's always some other time.. or something
no trouble at all
well that's good
Ed Sheeran's song Lego House is nice
oh yeah. well I hope you get the chance
yeah. Good luck with that
I mowed some grass yesterday
which.. cut a bunch of leaves at the same time
it was cold and lonely
I would have invited a friend. but they were all at the football game
so I was stuck at home alone the entire night
yeah, sorry for the messages and the phone call..
yeah.. yesterday
it's okay
Tomorrow as in today. and I was disappointed because I missed you that one time you were on facebook.. and I couldn't get ahold of you on the phone and I was alone doing nothing
and my sewing machine isn't catching the thread
don't be.. it's not your fault. and it's fine.. 
well.. it's really fine
same here
yeah. sorry
I'm so sorry. I should let you get to something important
well.. good luck. it's okay if it doesn't happen. umm.. silence.. I'll go get out of your way n' stuff. bye I guess :/
I have physics.. that's it. I suppose I should do that..
yes
sorry for not having enough homework..
oh.. I suppose I have a test to study for
yes. if you have a lot of homework I can let you do it

Aw I wish I could too.. I was mowing the lawn.. so I didn't get this until just now. and I'm glad it works well (: . Well.. your mom probably said no.. and I have to go mow soon.. but maybe if that gets done quickly and she didn't say no.. I don't know, sorry.. either way have a great day (:
Yeah.. I was too late :/  Have fun with dinner (:
I'm sorry for calling then.. I was just so excited about doing stuffs maybe.. but yeah, tomorrow if you say so... Goodnight and sweet dreams (: You're pretty amazing :3 and.. if you'd care to know, I love you (:. sorry, g'night :D

I miss you too, Leandra. I like.. thought about you.. all throughout my dreams n' whatnot. it was nice (:. sorry

haha, that's even sillier :3
:D. I'd love that. ...
I love you (:
haha :D. you're amazing :3
Nah.. I'm extra ordinary. I love you so much, Leandra!. I can't believe the sharpie washed away so quickly
Hey.. if there isn't room.. we'll find some room anyway. like.. when packing. I'll make room :D
I would surely follow
:D. Awesome :3
I can be your sidekick 
yeah :D
but if you need to get saved.. I will be there for you
You're cute.. just to let you know
I love you so so so much . just to let you know :3. It would be really neat to see you today.. if at all possible. sorry
Wherever is fine with me. do you have a preference?
Me too. I'd even be fine with being confined. :D
yeah :D. I like the sound of the brig if you're there
(:. ah.. sorry
aww.. okay
that's okay. well have fun (:. I'll find something to do in the mean time. maybe write you something :D. sorry.. you didn't hear that. but umm.. bye for now then
I love everything to do with you too :3
It's all perfect. Okay, take as long as you want :D
I have an idea of what to do :D. talk to you later (:. have fun!!. I have to move some lawn furniture really quickly.. so if you pop on as I do that then just know I'll return shortly. Unless of course you just don't want to do anything anymore.. because that's fine too
It's not. !!!. That makes it even less of a disappointment :D
Oh, well that sounds pretty nifty. I'll try to be there as soon as possible then :D. Well.. see you soon? (:
bye. Me too
I felt overly compelled to say something to you.. but I feel like it wouldn't mean much at the moment.. so I'll save it for later, but lemme tell you now.. you're really really cute :3. sorry :/ I don't know why but I really really miss you.. sorry, that sounds really bad.. sorry, I hope you had a good day. goodnight and sweet dreams. :/
nah.. that's silly
Hello
haha.. I just woke up. How are you doing?
!!. That sounds amazing :3. Like you :D
I like pancakes :P
You don't need my help. Plus then you'd have to see me 
that's crazy
oh.. I had a dream about you last night
oh.. in mine?. umm.. it was okay. You kinda had to leave early on in it
there wasn't an after party. afterwards I was walking down the street and I got hit by a car
which was weird
nope
I got like.. a broken leg
and I laid there for the longest time
and the ambulance that drove by went and picked up someone else. and you left already
that would have made an awesome dream. but it's okay, I'm fine. anyway, I should let you get to your pancake
Me too
well that doesn't sound as glamourous . but I'll let you get to that then (:
I might have an answer 
That sounds amazing. but why would you wanna do something with me?. nonetheless, I would love to
Totally positive
haha. well since your day is already made. you don't need to see me anymore. just kidding, I'm just being silly
You're impossibly amazing :3
no way. You're perfect :D
!!. I like it too :D. I really like Tarzan.. even though I don't have a VHS player to watch it
Really?. It'd be so cool if you did
okay. (:
haha, well that's okay. I guess I'll just never be able to see it'. anyway.. you probably have stuffs to get to
nah, that's too much trouble
But I'll let you get to stuffs
:/. yeah, have a great day
I would, but I thought you forgot
one of the songs came on shuffle.. so it reminded me of it. but you don't have to waste your time with me. I can let you get on with your day
yes
nah, that's fine
thanks.. you probably have better stuff to do with your time than to see some guy
ah well.. either way
that's silly.. . anyway, bye I guess.. I don't want to waste anymore of your time
I don't have to mow or rake today
and you wouldn't want to see me.. 
Doesn't sound like you would
I don't know.. you just seem busy and that you're okay with me leaving
which sounds awesome.. but it's okay... sigh.. yeah, it's totally fine. I'll let you get to stuff
well.. I'll let you get to that stuffs then
I'm free whenever. so yes
I'll let you do your stuffs so that you can be too :P. bye for now
me too :3. bye
(:. bye
I love you too (: I'm sorry I missed that message
If you say so.. but yeah, I love you so much (:
Now?
aww.. I don't think I got there fast enough
I meant fast enough to your house :D I love you too (:
It was okay I suppose
I was actually thinking about calling you.. but I didn't want to be a bother :P
Thank you for risking it :D
Me too :D
Why not?. I bet it'd be fun :D
What could you do home alone though? Other than be alone :(. :/ yeah.. sorry.. you probably wouldn't want to talk to me... have fun?. sorry.... Yeah.. I'll get out of your way n' stuff.. sorry for talking
of course you can
yes?
I love you too, Leandra (:
:3
You're cuter than a cute walrus face. :D
Hey, shouldn't I let you get to that shopping?. I'll take that as a yes.. bye I guess
oh well.. have fun with Twe then... yeah, I'll totally get out of your way.. wouldn't want to be a bother.. and you don't have to bother with posting that thing.. it'll take too much time
thank you. those are pretty cute
I suppose that means you have to leave though.. so bye
I doubt I will.. but thanks. I hope you do. bye. *sigh*.. :/. Goodnight and sweet dreams! (:
I'll try, and you too :D I love you so much too, Leandra! :3. and by you too I mean.. with everything today -_-. ^_^. *
Same with my dream o.o. And that offer sounds awesome, and nothing gets in the way of it too :P. but umm.. I suppose I can let you get on with your day n' what not
Hello (:
How are you?. I can't remember my dream
Out of the house as in what?
okay
It's okay
Yeah. I'd suggest that we could still do something.. maybe. but I wouldn't know what
I'm no help
in stuff. but that sounds nice :3. and it's not too cold outside
Yeah :D
but then again.. why would you want to do anything with me?. you should probably just do your homework
but why, I'm all lame n' stuff
You can't say that. it wouldn't be true. because you're perfect
But I am lame
yes
I'm a loser then
sure I am
nah
haha.. that doesn't mean anythign. anything*. see? I fail.. :/
Well I did. anyway.. would you like to go on an adventure with me today?
I don't really know how to adventure properly.. but I suppose we can always figure it out as we get to it
why a magic talking dog?
good point. I can be your magic talking dog then?
If that's who you want to be
it's okay. maybe though
for what?
I suppose stripes?
that they are. how and when would you like to adventure?
hmm.. in town you say. and I think I'd be able to now
would we be walking or biking?. or was that a silly question?
okay, neat :3
Okay, well.. whenever you're ready
wherever is fine with me. so.. wherever you want to, then I'd want to too. I was wanting to play tag at the hand n' hand. and then lay down in the boat car. and then bike somewhere after that :p. but whatever you want to do is cool too :D. I'm just making ideas. but I'm really fine with just adventures
So.. we could meet there?
okay, awesome. Let me get some stuff together and I'll be there right away. we can totally meet in the boat :3
okay, awesome. see you soon then :D
not if I'm already out there
are you unable to?
so no bikes then?
oh, okay. so.. bikes and the hand n' hand are a go?
awesome
of course
really?. What did you do?. just kidding :P. but awesome :D
maybe
Really?. But.. what?. That's really cool too. so what do you want to do then?
well.. we can always do both?. or.. something, I'm ready to go to the park if you want to
Yes we can. I'll bike to your house then :D
See you soon? (:
haha, awesome :3
yes
Yes
Absolutely positive :D. Shall I see you soon then?
awesome :D
I can't wait. jinx. :D. sorry.. it wasn't exact enough I suppose. Bye for now then (:
:3. ttfn
Goodnight and sweet dreams (: I had so much fun today! but I'm still sorry for everything. but yeah, I hope you sleep well and have a great day tomorrow
I love you too. They're still not home though.. and I don't think they will be for a long time. so glad you made it home on time though :d. :3 *
me too :D. aww.. you're soo perfect :3. aww.. the sandwich never got to you.. so I'm going to have to somehow get it to you later today. I'm sorry :/ I'm just a failure... at everything.. why would you care about someone like me? I couldn't say that, so I'm sorry... so I'm going to go to bed sad now...
I'm sorry
I am though :/
Sure I have :/
you wouldn't disturb me... you never do. I just feel.. I don't know. Like a waste of your time. :/
sure I am
because.. I don't know.... I just am. and i do everything wrong
well.. okay...
I'm still wasting your time.. because you were going to bed..... so.. goodnight :/
well.. goodnight anyway. I don't want to be any less of a disappointment . or.. more of a*. and.. I failed again :/. I just can't do anything right
I was spot on as a disappointment is what that sounds like. and I suppose I was...
you don't have to waste your time
yeah 'don't waste your breath'
I'm not :/
amazing people do things right..
and so far I feel like I've done everything wrong
sandwich.. . I burnt myself with hot honey. I asked stuffs yesterday. I kept you too long yesterday. I kept calling and being lame. I tried to make origami and I failed. I just.. wasted your time in just about everything. I don't know why you'd want someone like me.. not that you do. I suppose you don't . I wouldn't want someone like me either. so yeah.. goodnight . and sweet dreams
no I'm not :/
it looks pretty late...
I should probably let you get to sleep and let myself do the same
it wasn't dripping fast enough.. so I heated it up :(. which I know wasn't a good idea. but I didn't know what else to do
you wouldn't have burnt yourself though.. I'm just dumb enough to do so
I'm just the worst everything
and last night.. the stuff I said and did..
and you said you'd like to see someone else in that balaclava . which is okay.. I understand
... my eyes are burning :/
small stuff piles up
and I don't want to do anything bad when you're involved. and no.... I just.. everything.. my eyes.. and rain maybe. I don't know
and you probably wouldn't have cared anyway. I just.. shouldn't have asked you that question last night.. . because you didn't care about that either
no you don't.. but it's okay
It doesn't really matter anyway
you don't have to call me. I'd just sound sad still
I don't know
okay.... I shouldn't keep you up any longer..... so goodnight I suppose. sweet dreams
I don't need you to stay up for me..
It's fine
no need
okay..
It really doesn't matter. get that hoodie.. and I'll go
It's never mattered.. and it's never been important. why make anything special?
then it'd be the first that you do. and nothing in particular 
no it didn't (for the second thing)
you told me so..
It just.. doesn't matter
don't worry about it.. just get some sleep
maybe... anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams
tell me what?
you sure I know?
okay..
okay
well.. that's okay. just.. tell me tomorrow then..
goodnight and sweet dreams
crazy
I don't know
why not?
okay. well.. I'm sorry again. goodnight and sweet dreams
aw, you don't have to
I mean.. if you want. but it probably won't be worth wild. aww.. it's not 9:30 any more?
no.. I was just going to go to bed early
I saw that Patrick was on.. you can tell him whatever you wanted to tell me 
goodnight & bye
I don't know
you wanted to tell me something
Well.. I guess I missed it. but yeah, I suppose it's got a bunch of people on it
crazy.. I only have one person in my "VIP"
but have fun with your 3
I suppose. Bye Leandra..
I still didn't get anything too outstanding.. facebook is being really glitchy but you probably said it somewhere. bye Leandra
Goodnight and sweet dreams
See ya
aww.. my computer was all like.. pew pew.. like.. a laser, so I didn't see that I love you.. but it made me pretty happy :3 I love you too! So much :D
I love you so much too, Leandra.. you're the most beautiful person I've ever met.. not just on the outside.. but on the inside.. I'm so glad I can call you my bestest friend :3
Aww.. I went :/. I'm sorry :/
possibly. I just thought that I had missed it
called who?
No I didn't get anything.. I just left
oh, well I was already gone I suppose
You didn't waste my time
I did
it's of no fault of your own
It's okay though. I'm just a little cold
I wore a hat and a nice sweater . and gloves. it was just.. snowing too
I was thinking that.. I would drink some hot cocoa.. to warm up
I'm still a little cold
I love you too :3. Sooooo much :D
like I said.. I was tired. :D. I.. wanted to bring you hot cocoa too... but you already have some packets
I'm sorry. It was difficult 
You did well (:. and I know I just came back from the cold.. but I wanted to
You're probably thinking "nooo don't do it.. don't waste your time". If you want to know if it's snowing where I am.. then no it's not
Really?
Am I missing out on the snow?
I just want to bike over there just to see it :P. And you have a point
there's always tomorrow for hot cocoa. whoa.. I wish I could see it :/. wait. it's starting here. Think there's a snow delay 
Or like.. when you send something on faceboo. facebook*. you get it a little bit after. It's not much here. I doubt it'll get too good. I wanna catch snowflakes on my tongue while it lasts . !!!. I think that's something I want to do with you :3
nah, I'm not that cool
I don't think I'm going to be able to catch the sunset. !!!. :3
That sounds amazing!
:D
^_^. No way. You. are . making. it. sound. better. every. second. !!! :3. sorry for that
I messed up with the "enter" so I just went with it
what is it?
I have seen that
It's our secret
if people don't know how awesome the place is.. then no one comes and it makes it as good as it is. but now..
haha
yeah 8). they'll look like that
nah, shades are too mainstream . !. but when you say squirtle... you may be onto something (but it was warturtle)
wartortle*
the evolution of squirtle. it's squirtle then wartortle then blastoise 
It kinda stopped snowing I think
Lucky :/. whoa.. you have a point there girlfriend
oh. well.. still
both?. Are you okay with being my girlfriend girlfriend?
I know it's not the best thing in the world. haha.. I can be your sillyhead :D. :3. I love you, Leandra (:
You're perfect 
aw... are you just saying that because you need to do stuff?. like.. the soup.. :P
I wish I had soup in a thermostat . but alas
I have none of that
I never said what my favorite was
whoa.. . I suppose chowder is nice
haha... A cute stalker :D. and not even that. you're just.. really cute :3
I don't eat that much soup. I suppose any kind is pretty good
chowder does sound pretty good
right about now :P
What is coming back to me?
whoa.. 
haha, well thank you (:
I suppose I do recall it
me neither. but it's making me hungry either way :3. like a kitty
Now I wish I had soup
aww.. you don't have to. even though that would be really nice. and like.. the sweetest thing ever
and amazing
haha, is that really what happened?. or your guess
aw, you don't have to :3
I'd have nothing to give to you. haha, probably. I don't know.. I don't think I do actually. we haven't had soup in the house since like... the dark age
kidding of course. but.. it's been a while
nice :D
That sounds pretty awesome. You're so sweet.. :3. even for thinking of bringing me soup. well.. even though you said I couldn't bring you hot cocoa
and she said no?
haha. If I really was in Antarctica
You'd find me and I'd be like "how'd I get here?!?". aww.. okay
And you'd be like "oh, we were having a hypothetical discussion and it really happened"
those darn penguins
but okay :/ I'll let you get to your homework. have fun!! :D. and don't forget, I love you so much, Leandra!
You're perfect in every single way :D
lucky.. you've got thoup
yes.. actually
it's cruel how they put an 's' in that word
It was probably like.. some colleague without a lisp. and he didn't like the guy with one. or he was friends with him and did it as a joke 
I withh to thay that you're really sthpethial
But you couldn't tell if he had one or not. You're special, and if your child ever has a lisp
name him Gary
Name him Seodore. oh yeah, I forgot :P. sorry. those are pretty good names 
Better than mine
I like Leandra. It's a good name
and I hear she's pretty amazing. and perfect. and a good girlfriend
Teddy is a great name, by the way
great*
when you saw Glee. or that 
that's totally what I meant :D
Anyway, I won't waste any more of your time
have fun with homework :D
I'll try
I love you so so so so much, Leandra :3. I actually liked the names you said
yeah (:
whoa. You'll totally find yourself a Timothy. and fall in love
I don't know..
because he'd be soo cute
I was actually suggesting that you find some boy named Timothy though. but okay, bye then. I like the name James.. also. sorry. have fun. bye
I didn't know it was in a Twilight Book. okay.. 
I suppose it's cool that you like Peter. and yeah, that's what I was thinking. sort of
Teddy would be an amazing dog name :D
sorry..
You have a cat o.o
:D. I love you :3. Have fun. bye (:. sorry
maybe. it'd be neat
Bye Leandra :3. I think I totally missed the sunset.. . but yeah, bye. and good night and sweet dreams for later if I don't get the chance to say it later . Bye :D
It's completely fine (:  I love you so much ^_^. sorry.. but it's true (: bye
Goodnight :3 I love you too, Leandra :D
I love you too :3 Sorry still though :p. Have an amazing day!! :3
oh, I'm sorry for calling :P. I'm sorry for missing you too :/. I tend to do that. but yeah, I hope your day was awesome. and that your night will be just as good :D
I.. overslept :/
possibly. but I forgot to set an alarm. so that could've been it too
haha, that would've been too much trouble. anyway, I'm probably too much trouble now :P. I should let you get to stuffs or something
Well, I should let you get to that then (:
there's only so much Peter you can take in :p
sure it does.. I'm not that fun to begin with
that's silly
It's.. so quiet here 
It's not 11:11 yet. yeah
yeah. I should watch those movies some time. seeing how it's almost Christmas
I think I like the 1st one the most. but the second one is.. pretty close. It loses me at the third
ah. Gotcha. and I don't know what to wish for
1st he's stuck in his house. 2nd he's stuck in a different hotel
3rd it's a completely different kid in his house
that's the 1st
The second has a toy store and a creepy bird lady. the first had a creepy old man
and Rob Schneider is a bellhop in the second. and I've seen the third once
me too. It's tradition to watch Home Alone. I don't remember a Christmas when I haven't watched it
yeah
We should watch Home Alone. or.. not.. it is Christmas. so you probably would have other plans. and any other day near Christmas time
would you really?. that's.. crazy. anyway.. you're probably busy. I should go and be alone some more
yeah I know. but I've got some paint buckets and marbles in hand. and I've never seen that movie before. It wasn't crazy for me to ask. and I think I know what to wish for.. but it can't come true. :/
whoa.. I remember a movie with a huge pile of pumpkins. but that movie sounds.. awesome. I sort of want to watch it. like.. not just sort of but a lot
and I wish that I didn't do that.. thing last night :/
could we?
I found the movie on youtube.. so I think it's possible to watch it?. sometime. maybe. if you wanted. and I would have thought you would have wished that it didn't happen too. sorry :/
I don't think it could change things that much. that one thing. it could just make thigns better. and I would like to watch it with you sometime :3. things*
right.. now. :P. kidding, of course. and I don't make things better. I'm lame
yeah, if only
Umm.. Swiss Chocolate?. definitely not me.. I'm not special
nah. nothing special here. the only time I'm anywhere close to special. is when I'm with you :3
haha, you do. but I meant is when I'm with you.. I'm close to special. because you're special :D
even crazier
nah
nah. that's silly
I've never seen it :P. umm.. I love you (:. sooo much :3. I'm still sorry for what I did though :/
you didn't mess up at all
you're perfect
uh uh
not me
I think you're super amazing. but I just don't fit the bill
that's silly talk. I suppose I should let you get on with stuffs though. You've probably have a lot to do
and.. I don't know how you messed up :P
well it's clear how I did. and I should let you get to the neverending studying
me neither
but I think I messed up still. so.. I'm sorry. have fun studying? and goodnight and sweet dreams! (:
watch something scary and get scared!
hold your breath?. and drink several sips of water?
ah. that's good. I had them when I was at home. and then I biked to your house and still had them
yeah
we should watch it some time
It was okay :3
You're perfect :D. and warm. but not as warm as those socks
too warm :P. yeah, you'd get bored if I were asleep. you'd just have to sleep too. and speaking of. you said you were going to bed. I wish I could tuck you in. but.. goodnight and sweet dreams. I love you (:. sorry again for messing up :P
yeah, I'm the only one in the house :P
it's okay
I have :/. like last night
that's silly
okay
yay :D
I love you so so so so so so much too, Leandra! (:
you're cute
I laheartve you too :3 . sorry I missed that.. I hope you're having a really nice day :D It's nice outside (:. !! Remember that movie I was talking about, how it was like.. different, but halloween-ie? I think I found it.. and I would like to ask you if you'd want to watch it with me some time.. maybe or something I don't know, please? sorry :P
sorry. :/. well.. goodnight and sweet dreams I suppose.. I hope your day was really good (: I love you, Leandra :3 (if you care to know). sorry :/
sorry
It was okay I suppose. sorry. you probably have important stuff to do. so.. goodnight and sweet dreams
or unimportant stuff is me
yeah.. sorry :/
I'm sorry . I'm just... I don't know. my eyes were really red earlier.. not that you care. not that I should have even said that
nothing important. and yeah, I'm fine.. it was just after track practice. sounds really lame, I'm sorry. It just.. doesn't matter
I did. it doesn't matter
I don't matter
nothing... it really doesn't matter
and I don't know if I could tell you here. and I don't know why you'd care
probably
and you wouldn't want to see me at all... and if you did you wouldn't be able to. so yeah, it doesn't matter
I don't know. it's not like tomorrow makes any difference. Tomorrow would be like it is right now
it's nothing
yeah
yup. let me let you get to stuff
I'm sorry. there's something bothering me.. but I don't feel comfortable saying it. so for now.. it's nothing
I'd have to see you to let you know... so yeah.. I should go be sad somewhere else
have fun doing whatever. thanks for caring
nope.. no help
you can't see me smile... and maybe
well.. then imagine it. have fun with i. it*
well that seems very unlikely. and I don't think you'd try that hard. not tonight.. or tomorrow
yeah. you really don't seem that concerned.. so I'll just go and let you do whatever you like
you weren't too concerned at track practice either.. so I suppose it makes sense
it doesn't matter
I suppose you'd have to figure it out. but as far as I know..
I can't do anything right. and I don't deserve you.. you don't say that I do. and if you did I'd know it not to be true
I just keep messing up. you didn't sound so sure before. I've just been assuming that I ruined everything Friday night
and that slowly things will hurt. if you say so...
I forgot to do laundry.. darn :/
I had no time when I got home
I asked if... I didn't.. but I should study a little still
someone could help me out possibly. but they didn't
I don't know what I'm doing in physics..
yeah.. same here
yeah
right. well I suppose I should do that. then..
yeah.... but I still won't be happy
me.. I broke my own heart
and you don't even seem to care
what's freaking out?
that's not a question... there was never a question mark in there
that's what I thought
no you had the exclamation mark
goin' around just leavin' him behind
when all the question mark ever really wanted was for you to just.. keep him along. and to reassure him 
there was so much that question mark said before and you never even noticed
maybe he's just waiting for you to let him know without any guessing. it was yesterday
yeah
I laheartve you too   sorry I missed that.. I hope you're having a really nice day  It's nice outside (:  1:46pm !! Remember that movie I was talking about, how it was like.. different, but halloween-ie? I think I found it.. and I would like to ask you if you'd want to watch it with me some time.. maybe or something I don't know, please? sorry sorry    6:26pm well.. goodnight and sweet dreams I suppose.. I hope your day was really good (: I love you, Leandra  (if you care to know)  sorry . I guess you never cared to know
if you wanted. it's okay. they weren't important
that question mark might just want to know. second guessing is easy to do without reminders
it doesn't matter
crazy. well... sometimes I say "I love you" and you seem soo reluctant to say it back.. and if you don't mean it, then okay... 
and if I ever needed a hug.. I know that you wouldn't give me one
Actions speak louder than words. and I don't know. I suppose it would mean you'd still want me around
it's an action still. and you wouldn't though. I know you too well
I doubt it
I don't know what you mean by "as kisses go..". and that's why I've felt so bad. I messed up Friday night and had an entire weekend to think about it. and now I just don't know if you still want me. because I'm awful. and the worst at everything. and I don't deserve you at all
I think I did
but the one thing.. that one thing
the kissing thing. I shouldn't ever do that. ever
:/
I'm so sorry :/. It's not okay
I'm such an awful person
that's what I did
the kiss thing
it does to me. you've marked it off on a list. it's gross to you. and I don't know what I was doing. I was just.. being a sillyhead 
that doesn't help :/
I'm sorry
It's hard to convince me on facebook... I can never tell anything
I don't know
I'm sorry
It's probably my fault though. I should just believe you
I should do that laundry :/
I hinted with the question mark thing. I want you there for me.. . I want to be close. but I want to hold your hand and you want to let go
It's okay. maybe I ask too much
what do those several notes say?
You're the best girlfriend ever. I just don't know how to be the best boyfriend. because I want to be perfect. but I always think I'm doing everything wrong
the ones I gave you today
well it's your decision . you don't have to be. but I still think you are. even if you made me cry on the way home in a car. along with walking to the mailbox. and maybe a little when I took my shower. but it made me smile in the end.. when I noticed my eyes were the same color as my skin
well like.. my eyes are white. mix in some red in there
and it roughly matches the color of my skin. especially since my face turned red as well
well.. it happens when you cry. let's just say.. I miss you. and I haven't seen you since Friday. sorry.. that makes no sense. forget I said that. anyway.. I should go do that stuffs
it was fun though..
drawing you pushing baskets
nah. not really. anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams
I think you're pretty... but you'll probably just hide away again :/. and no sweet dreams or goodnight for me
it's not though
even if I said you were cute.. you'd still turn the other way
don't waste your wishes on me...
and I'm still not "better"
it'd be even cuter if I saw you blush
no.. "better" as in.. feeling better
And you know what?. I've been starting to like tomatoes . especially if they were as sweet as you
and.. I'll always love you. you may say that
's* a silly thing to say
but.. I believe it to be true
I was just an "onion" because no one likes onions . well.. he sounds like a lucky guy. I wish it were me :/
lasagna is so good (:
o.o. that would be amazing. but a silly waste of your time. sorry.. I'm wasting your time even now. and I has that stuffs to do. so.. goodnight again . sorry.. again
I bet you could be duck tape though <(")
maybe.. a Mighty Duck
I haven't either. so you're good
you're the best even
it's not that old..
it's like.. 90's
I'm not, you are, 100%. You're all I've ever wanted.. but I don't know why you'd want me
anyway, I should depart now. sorry for everything
seeing how germaphobic you are. I think you're better than germ-x
sure you aren't
I mean.. still. you take it to new measures. and that reminds me of Tangled . which.. is so good, by the way :3. I want to watch it again. with you maybe. but you've already seen it. so.. I don't know. anyway way.. I'm sorry
You don't want to waste your time with me. oh.. jewel thief. Tangled. :P
sorry. what can I say?
I'm your sillyhead boyfriend
so there is a time? when you wouldn't want me to be?
if you're not "that" crazy
haha. really?. do do.. 
haha
no it's not
and I want to be yours forever and always. well.. that joke is just of poor taste. just kidding . I would have laughed too ^_^
Is it weird.. but I came on hoping that you had poked me. because it's the first thing I look for
no way
no way :/. I love you soooo much. I just.. would like to hear it more often
I'm sorry. that makes it sound like you don't want to
because if you don't want to.. I understand :/
my heart knows
my head gets in the way though
you just have to slap me or something
My head says "Why would she care?" "She couldn't love you.." . stuff like that
"She's way too perfect."
A big meanie
other times it's like "she's sooo pretty.. and I'm sooo lucky to be hers.. but why would she want to be yours?" . I've always sold myself short. says my father. it's just something I've always done
it's like.. how I'm programmed
sorry. I'll let you do stuffs. bye and goodnight. sweet dreams too
and.. I can't find a good tacky sweater for you. but I'm still looking. I mean..
what sweater?
yeah. that's good
polar bears sound awesome
I mean... what polar bears?
well.. goodnight
don't forget.. I love you. but.. I probably need to remember stuffs more than you do
because our minds are in sync
and we think alike. and we're just.. perfect for eachother. :3. sorry..
I don't know..
I mean, you even fit perfectly in my arms. And you know what's up. like.. fun stuff to do :D
I'm glad you did (:
It made me super happy
What's the condition?
I'm never convinced that you did. but.. okay. goodnight (:. sweet dreams
I'm still convinced that I'm awful for what I did Friday
if you say so. you'd have to convince me otherwise somehow. but I should really be going. I just.. really like talking to you
bye
see ya. aww.. I love you so much. you're so perfect :3
aww.. but it's not crazy. you're so perfect to me* better?. aww.. you're all gone :/. right before I could say any more. you're sooo cute, and special and amazing. sorry :/. aww.. who am I kidding? no one could love me... :/. have a good Thanksgiving.. I hope you have a lot to be thankful for..
I love you too, Leandra
thank you for wanting me.. even though I'm not a good track buddy. don't forget.. you're perfect. I'm the last thing on your mind at all times.. and you probably won't get this so.. yeah. well.. goodnight and sweet dreams I suppose
aww.. I missed you :/. and I miss you. sorry :/. well.. I shouldn't call you, I'm not even near a phone. :/. so.. goodnight and sweet dreams. and it'll be hard to oversleep for track tomorrow :P
It seems that way
Hello
nope. I don't think so. you?
awesome. sounds like fun
yeah. Well it'd be hard to oversleep until 3:15
me too
no, you brought it up first
I think I remember it. so you first
O.o
and?
crazy
it sounds amazing (:
that's just how amazing you are ^_^
I forgot
just kidding. Okay.. so it was pretty crazy as well. You were there. and we found a secret room in my house. and the room led out to this huge building. with really cool stuff inside. we fixed all the lights. and I found a puppy and gave it to you :D. and we were just having a lot of fun in this place. but I messed up again so you left :/
and then I just wandered in the place. and found a bunch of game machines and pinball n' stuff
and I played dodgeball with a bunch of people
and then I woke up
You're leaving because I'm awful and who would want to stay with me?
why would you miss me?. I'm nothing special. but after getting water I went back to sleep because this was like.. 4 in the morning
I love you too. but I'm just your sillyhead . :3
really?. what about all of those other sillyheads?
me too. but I want you, not me
and the pancakes :P
I would be free. I'm not doing anything else
are you free at all today?. :d
neat :D. I think
(:
sure you can. if you wanted
okay. bye
it's fine
you're probably not going to be free today.. are you?
okay
maybe. so.. like what?
:P
Anything with you is fine (:. I just mostly want to see you. sorry.. that's silly 
I don't know. maybe. there's always a bunch of stuff :D. like youtube movies. or more monopoluy. monopoly*. or character scrabble
wherever you want
umm okay. sorry
that she does
well there's after track practice. as for place... I'd say that there is a playground.. squires . or.. I don't know
oh.. right... so it'd have to be before track practice?
okay :D
I just forgot to mention that :P
before track :P
yeah. so.. what would you like to do prior to track?. /when would be best for you?
okay . that sounds really cool (:
well.. you and I should check then
aww.. is that a no?
she was fine with it. I didn't know that was what you were mentioning. and.. I could do stuffs.. if you were able to
neat
aww.. is that bad?
it's more time than I thought it would be (:
oh.. well.. okay. never mind then
well if she doesn't want it to happen, then it's fine
and I don't think I could play
yeah.. I guess . aw :/
I'm not going to see you at all this break, am I?
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving
I'm not something to be thankful for. but thanks
if you say so
I haven't noticed it being gone. then you can keep it for a lil' longer
no it's fine :P
really
so fun. :D
yeah :D
maybe, but I doubt it
good to know
maybe I didn't make myself clear. good to know :D
I probably wouldn't want to leave though
and sleep on the floor? (:
aww.. I wanted the floor. but.. it'd be really far from you :P
cause there's some extra space on your floor next to your bed
Sidekick :D
aww :3
aww.. okay. It's almost 11:11. don't forget to wish. have fun with everything. I love you (:
I'll miss you :/
sorry. bye
aww... can I always be your sillyhead?
Bye Leandra :D. you're cute . :3
I wish my dream wasn't a dream. because it was fun having you there
that was fine. I actually think you can back. long enough for dodgeball :D. anyway, bye (:
I think everyone was like "these games are cooler than dodgeball". so they played them. but I'm sure you were on my team. bye. have a nice Thanksgiving!. and be thankful for stuffs :D
just incase I die before track practice
:P. bye
or if I died during track practice. then I would have at least said it
okay. I love you too. Tah tah for now Leandra :D
You're so perfect :3. and pretty!. bye (:. sorry
I don't know. and I wished. but I think I wasted it
I wished to see you. what did you wish for?
I sort of wanted it to be other than at track though
but since we said it... wishes don't come true 
maybe
we won't know until it happens
yeah. anyway, you were going to do stuffs. so I'll let you get to it (:
it's okay (:. I was missing you too
you don't have to bike over. I wouldn't want to waste your time. even though that sounds really nice
psh.. I bike because I want to
my hobby is going out of the way to see you
haha, well.. I'll let you get back to stuffs
being like what?
you don't seem that way. not yet at least
you never seem to get that way
maybe it'd be nice for a little bit
that doesn't sound too bad
I don't know how bad it'd get. but I think I'd like to find out
yes (:
are you the kind of person who likes challenges?
well consider it a challenge :D
:D. well.. I'll let you get to stuffs. have fun :3
sorry for what?
nah
no way (:
aww.. apparently it's cold outside
I have to bike there.. because I haven't a ride of my own
oh I wouldn't want to be a bother
it's silly. I wouldn't want to impose 
especially not after what you said about your mother
but then I'd probably need a ride home too. it would just be too much trouble. unless I biked over. and got a ride back to my bike. then it would be almost as if I wasn't there. but still..
well it sounds amazing. but I don't want your mother upset
well if she does.. then I'm fine without a ride
positive?
really?. you sure?
well.. okay. if you're sure. you said 2?
I would think so . thank you  (:
well I'll let you get to stuffs and I'll go do stuffs. and I'll see you at 2
:D. yeah (:. ttfn (:
bye (:
me neither . okay 
awesome :D. You're so perfect :3
nah..
you don't sound convinced.. but okay. I'll let you get to your stuffs
okay, bye. see you at two
:3. farewell. :/
oh I don't know. sorry
sorry. sorry, you probably don't want to talk to me :P
what's to worry about?
I'm sure it's fine (:. anyway, I'll see you soon. if you still want to see me :P
okay (:. I'll do the same.. . bye :D
you're cute :3. bye. so cute
what?. that. is crazy. sorry.. I was sort of in the kitchen
well.. I'm ready whenever you are. and if I need to bike there, I'm ready for that too
positive. the only ones home are playing videogames
2 player game, so.. they won't miss me :P. yeah. if you still want me.. then I'm yours
I was unaware
but that still means you could like.. switch off every now and then with the person you're playing with
oh yeah. would you want me to bring that?. because I was thinking.. that it may be difficult to do such things
yeah (:. I can bring it still if you like
so?. it's probably less than that. so.. would you like me to bring it or not?. or.. do you just not want me there at all :P. ?*
as for the game/. ?*
that's what I was thinking. but I was also thinking just in case :P. but okay (:
okay (:. and maybe
awesome
I have a surprise for you too
and.. good luck!
Don't get hurt
what.. you have a surprise?. that's crazy. okay (:. see you soon. bye :3. Happy Thanksgiving!!! (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams (: I hope your day was amazing!
I totally slept through Thanksgiving and had to eat alone when I woke up..
Oh.. I was just.. not feeling so hot, so I lied down and fell asleep for a little bit.. . It's okay though. Well.. I hope you have a great black Friday. I think I miss you :/ sorry. sorry
Hi. How are you?
Oh, that's okay. and I'm sorry. it's probably silly
I'm okay I suppose
I haven't heard much recently. I think she's doing a little better. but no, didn't get to visit her
well thank you. I'll let you get to your studying
I do
yeah. but it's okay. talking to me isn't important
no, it's fine
You should do important stuff
I love you too.. why no drive?
I wish I could somehow motivate you. :3
I love you so so so so much too 
I think you're perfect :D
why do you feel bad about it?
I mean it was okay I suppose. eating alone n' all
but it's my fault. I shouldn't have taken that nap
it doesn't mean you should be with family. but thankful that you have it
Thanksgiving is about being thankful for what you have
I spent the whole day with them
just because I missed dinner didn't mean I didn't spend Thanksgiving well
oh, no. I took a nap at like.. 7 ish. pm*
I woke up though. because I fell asleep on the couch and everyone was like "we need to watch tv!!!"
It was actually for the Ice Age Thanksgiving Special. Anyway, I really should let you get to something more important. no matter how much I want to talk to you
nope. I've got nothing
yeah.. I suppose?
oh, yeah. I suppose. I guess. I feel like it'd be better than nothing
if you say so
well... I should let you do your homework so you can do anything
okay?
anything with you is nice
that sounds like a lot of fun (:. aside from the last part
I don't even know what that means
but you're probably far too busy for any of that stuff. especially if it involves me
I thought you were saying everything right :3
are you talking to someone else?. same here.. with the 'go ahead'
I don't know.. I think it's just a "run on your own" so.. decide on your own too
If you're really into it. I bet it would
nope
but I'm really bad.. so . I love you too! :D. So much :3
oh no. hurry. save the day
ah. well.. you saved it in my mind
you forgot to mention 'sillyhead' ^_^
You're the best hero/bestest friend/girlfriend ever
yeah, you could have multiple boyfriends.. but sillyheads?. reserved for me :P
I'm kidding
haha
you're cute. :3
that sounds silly
haha
aww, okay. have fun. you totally made me want to play wii sports :P
aw, it's okay
yeah. and those movies/kite flying are probably on the back-burner . so.. have fun with the homework (:
and Scream Teem. Team*
I'll be there for you?. I remember that Hotel Horror movie too. with like.. Kirsten Dunst 
it is a real movie
yes. any who, I'll let you get to your stuffs
 no, I'm not. but you are (:
you too. but I feel like I'm going to miss you a lot. or Alot
it's probably silly to want to see you today.. but I don't think I'll get the chance. and that stuffs sounds amazing
I don't have anything for you to take me away from . so maybe you will. you're way more amazing :D
thank you for helping (:. it was really fun :D. and it would be cool :3. I'll let you get to stuffs. so that maybe we can get to stuffs
I was going to say I'm thankful for you :P. and I'm sooooooooooooooooo lucky too :3. bye for now, amazing
:3
haha, bye (:. I hope to see you at some point
Bye Leandra (:. You're so special to me :3. bye
I love you too (: and you make me so so so super happy. tah tah for now. You're so cute :3. sorry
that's silly
nah
o.o. but no. that's silly. sorry
I meant.. the other thing was silly
sorry
I should have specified. nope
It just.. becomes 5:22 on it's own
I should.. probably let you get back to stuffs. or something
I've never had that. but.. I bet it is
Oh, hey.. I had some stuffs to give you. however.. you're probably busy.. or don't want to see me.. or several other reasons. so I suppose I'll wait. sorry.. that was random
I don't know. the con would be me. and that should overcome anything on the pro side. sorry.. 
... the bad thing on the list... better?. you probably have better things to do anyway
nah.... I'm lame
I don't know. because I'm not amazing?. and it's silly for me to want to give you stuffs. but it was an excuse to see you.. and I don't think my excuse is going to work with you. and you just seem so busy. /preoccupied with stuffs. and there's no good reason to see me... yeah.. I'll just go. bye
just no one would buy it. so.. to be less hopeful. I should just go
I don't know. either way.. I should just get out of your way
if you say so. I shouldn't have even thought.... sorry. well.. bye I guess
that I would see you today..
I doubt it
I would definitely like to
well you can see yourself anyday. ah. almost caught it
you just read my mind
exactly. anyway.. I should probably go. regardless of an answer. or a 'go ahead'
no.. not dinner
I just promised the computer to someone else
and oh. my dad and sister are all up in C-burg
yeah.. I wish I could see you still
oh well. :/
sorry. well.. bye I guess
ah.. okay. that's true. never mind then
sorry for even thinking it
poker/board games/videogames is fun stuff
I do think so
but I shouldn't impose or anything
that. sentence... lost me :P. maybe I could just drop the stuff off instead
okay then.. I'll get it together and be on my way
yeah.. it may take me a little bit..
and I'd like to.. but you know
okay, well I'll go then.. and see you in a second. I eat late 
so I'm fine
plus with all the work.. I ate lunch at like.. 4
bye. I'll tell you later. :P. bye
30-45 minutes or so. if that's.. okay 
bye
I love you so so so so much :3
aww, you're so perfect :3
NOT ME. sorry. caps. lock*. not me*. you're probably gone.. so.. okay. :/. I'm not cool though, . and you have a nice day as well
sorry
you would have gone to something else had I not shown up. oh. Yeah, I wish I could come too. I'll let you be going though
I'm no fun. I'll let you get to it. no worries
Don't you think that some toast would make it yummier . ?*
sounds.. fiber-y. rawr to you too 
anyway, I should let you get to your stuffs. I wouldn't want to waste a part of your day
that's silly. but okay. bye. have fun. along with the football watching
I never said I wouldn't
but now that you mention it..
yeah?. It's perfect?
Like always? :3
I bet you still look cute :3
Nah, you are (:. aww.. if I do get to watch football... can you leave it as is?
Really :D. what about me?
I could say the same about you (:
nah, that's crazy. if you saw my hair right when I woke up... you'd know. but I wanna see you. 're* hair :D. but... I wanna see you too :3. sorry. go go go go . to mexico

I love you too
I bet it's awesome (:. I don't want you to miss the football game. it starts in a little bit. so.. have fun (:
watch the game and do homework between commercials (:. and.. do homework now instead of talk to me. you won't miss much if you do that :D. and it get's crazier the last half
so you can do stuffs then go to the last half
you seemed so "hyped for the game" earlier
well there's still time to start now (:
and being clueless with you sounds really cool :3. I hope you do (:. gotta go gotta go :D

I believe in you! ^_^
I like you, by the way :3
Rap your journal
you're good at that stuffs (:. it's "some way to communicate your thoughts"
well.. rap it. then write it so peeps can understand dawg
I think you can do it
It's not one of those tough things like.. build the solar system over night
Well you said that it's hard getting started. if you rap it you'd know what you want to write
then you can write it "normal" ish
!!!. Do that :D. You. are an amazing artist (:. I love your doodles :3
The doodle thing sounds like it would work (:. and I bet it'd be really fun too :D
I really want to see your hair.. and you.. mostly you.. but you know... so I hope you get everything done at some reasonable time. or something. sorry... that sounds selfish. you're a great at drawing :D. anyway, I'll get out of your way so you can do stuffs. bye

shouldn't you be able to handle it then?
seeing how you're soo swee t :3
sweet*
aww man
that could have fed a family 
I would have loved it though
yes. :/. and now it's all gone :'(
well it could be the same :P
I love you too :3
Doughy much 
cookie dough much :D. shouldn't you be thinking of your homework though?
but I was looking forward to your hair
I suppose it was never meant to be
I was hoping I wasn't right :/. oh well
oh.. not what I said. "but I was looking forward to your hair I suppose it was never meant to be"
well.. I mostly just want to see you. hat or fuzzy head
I suppose I can always do something else though. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXqYw_II6Pc&ob=av2e. I heard that today on the radio. not that it's important to listen to it. or that.. it's saying anything. but umm.. where am I?. sorry
what comment?
where?. which comment?. huh?. is it getting hot in here?
umm.. phew.. I need some water or something
I need your ice. specifically
or reverse delivery?
a pick up. I love you too! (:. but I wasn't saying anything with the song... just sayin'. or if you need ice
hey.. if you're giving away free ice. I won't turn down the offer
you're ice. I mean.. nice. (:
ooo that's just cold
me? the best?. never. were you serious about the ice?. I could always pick up that 7-11 cup. you know.. I say that's a pretty valid excuse
so?
Does it look like I care?. no.. because you can't see me through the computer
You can find out whether I do or not by me being there. I think it solves the problem
I have this jacket. that smells like girl. I think it'll keep me warm. okay?. It did last night
smells like amazing. well.. maybe just this one girl. I mean.. it may sound creepy. but it's my jacket. so I can do whatever I want to it. like.. catch it on fire. !!. that'll keep me warm. :D. I think I've solved the problem
I'll just have to catch myself on fire
and then you can put it out with ice. :D
I think it could work. I'll be on my way then
yeah.. I wasn't going to leave without a reprieve . what does that word mean? I don't know.. but it rhymed with leave.. so I used it
sorry.. I'm being silly
me? perfect... nonsense 
nope
I will as long as I please 
so lost o.o. but maybe. or.. maybe not.. I don't know. aww.. I suppose you don't want to see me?. n' do your homework. .. okay.. well, have fun with that
yeah, I think that's what you meant
I was just.. blurting out that thingy
aww.. . my sister will probably leave Monday morning. and I see that it would be longer then... but... the 7-11 cup :P. sorry
:D. :D
soo.. is that a yes?. (:
seeing you a second is awesome. and.. aw..
so no tomorrow either then?
but if she said you could drop it off tomorrow.. . then that sort of implies.. 
hmm
sorry. I really wanted to see that hair..
I don't believe you
this could've been my only chance
I don't believe it. I'm just going to be bummed out about it. you just.. look perfect all the time.. no matter what you do
if you say so. I'd have to wait for your hair to be wet and then you go running a bunch. and then maybe.. . but I still don't think it'll ever happen. way to go, Leandra.. you're super perfect yet again
I probably wouldn't notice.. 
you'd still look super pretty
okay. if you say so
it was a joke?. I thought you were being serious
well you're possibly super cute. and.. I might just have a crush on you
I really do. I could go as far to say that I love you
Really?. that's crazy... I mean, I'm just some guy
and you're.. everything I didn't think I wanted
or.. I messed up the lyric
I didn't know* I wanted
-word of the day :D. I've been so nervous too. and I've felt like I've made mistakes. but somehow.. you still want me. it's crazy
haha. "I mean, this guy's okay... but I wanna party with this guy!"
aww.. and that's how I feel about you :3
I love you too. I have. have you?. (:
whoa.. same with mine. I do have pumpkin pie though
I've never had pumpkin cheesecake. and yes, I did. it's good stuff
I wish I could hold you. if.. that didn't sound creepy. I hope so too
with the.. pumpkin cheesecake
!!. that would be awesome :3. I love you (:. and.. I'll let you get to sleep (:. so that tomorrow will come sooner. and that.. maybe.. . I dunno. you know?. :P
yeah (:. Maybe :3. Well.. goodnight and sweet dreams :D
Don't forget that I love you. so so so much. I'm lucky to have you :3
but having me isn't so great
I totally made something for you as we spoke
You'll find out as soon as I get to see you. having you is more than anyone could ask for. :P. you must have wished pretty hard then
if Santa couldn't do it
I can't wait until Christmas. I hope you like the gift that I'm getting you :3
don't worry then. you don't have to get me anything. so that's one less person to worry about. like before, having you is more than enough (:
it is . :D. my memory box is getting full. random, sorry
because I just give you so much stuffs . sorry. not that you'd be keeping that stuff in a memory thingy
that's silly. anyway, you were all sleepy. I'll let you sleep (:. I wish I could be your pillow/blanket. sorry. I didn't say that. forget that :P. sorry
umm.. yeah. goodnight and sweet dreams (:
that would be nice

once. I think
I don't remember. it's when it just came out. but yeah, I should let you sleep n' stuff (:. so.. g'night and sweet dreams, Leandra
unless you wanted to video chat just to say goodnight. because that'd be fine with me :3
I hope you accidentally hit it
aww, why?. it's not hard. it's sort of like... that
jinx
sorry. I suppose for another day. goodnight and sweet dreams
That's scary o.o. I hope you're okay. maybe the wideo jinx was bad
nah, I'm slowly catching up to 0 debt
exactly :D. well.. goodnight Leandra. sorry for keeping you for so long

nothing.. special about it. maybe..
Goodnight Leandra, sweet dreams. and bye :3

could I?
oh, well.. don't let me hold you back

when we get to the point on having to decide on things
okay, lemme go charge it :D
so it can be full to battle!!. Greatest Christmas Sweater ever. sorry... I can just bike on over. so you wouldn't need to worry
shh. you didn't hear anything o.o
go play tennis though
we can do anything. I was just saying we can figure stuff out on the way
sure, if you like
wait.. 3:15?
I probably need to do some stuff first. can I meet you at the library?
umm.. what time works for you?. I would say around 3:45
yes :D. please excuse me if I'm a tad bit late. but that sounds fine :D. so.. I'll let you get to stuffs and see you then :3
okay, bye (:. have fun :3. okay. will do. bye :D
I can't say anything right.. so I'm sorry :/ but if there's something I can say that you like.. then I hope that I could.. I love you soo much Leandra! And nothing is going to change that, so don't forget it. I felt so horrible saying "I don't love you" in a hypothetical setting.. I wish I didn't :/ anyway, have fun with Rock Band and play a song for me :3 goodnight and sweet dreams
so mush :3 and I'll be all like "Hi there cutie pie" :3
I'll try, you too.. (:. I fail at everything :/. sorry :/ goodnight and sweet dreams I suppose. I really hate myself..
Fire Alarms by Ed Sheeran is a nice song :P and I love you too, Leandra. well.. goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra. there probably isn't much hope in you getting those messages or checking anything or whatever.. is there? nope.. didn't think so
well.. bye then
okay.. goodnight
if you say so
I love you too
go for it
I wasn't alright. but why would you care?
I felt like you were ignoring me. so I was just being quiet so I wouldn't bother you
I don't think you're clingy 
it's okay
I'm not "the right guy". so it's fine... you don't have to do anything. but for the most part I just felt really alone. and it got to a point that I would rather be alone than ignored. so when you were paying attention to me.. I don't know...
It's fine
I was pushed so far away I was able to dig it up
well thank you. I like getting tangled up with you
I think that would be nice :3
(:. I'm still getting you the tackiest sweater to ever be a sweater
I actually have a big list of things to do. just for you. so.. if you make my list incomplete.. well that'd just be sad :(
well.. I'll at least have a bunch of other things to give you. oh it's fine, I was kidding. but it's pretty much a battle
If I have to cut down a tree and make the sweater by hand and then sew a penguin on it.. and throw some glitter and tacks on it. I will
I have you.. so I'm hoping my gifts will eventually reach up to how amazing you are. it may take a few years. but I'll keep trying
me too. the one you gave me is still intact :D. and they're not perfect enough
not to match you
10 hours. yeah, I know you gotta sleep 
so goodnight and sweet dreams (:
I'm glad I don't have your homework.. it would take forever
like.. 10 hours
It was.. not so great.. but thanks. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams
you don't need me. I'm a good night?. sorry. bye, sleep well, cutie :3. bye
that's what I was thinking
Only a cuddle monster.. can make an honorary cuddle monster
bye Leandra :3
awesome :D
Mr. Snail with the mail. that could be your childrens story :D
I love you too (:. And I allow you to use it :D
You should write it :3. it'd be cute. bye 
No, like you :3
it was my pleasure.. I'm sorry though :/
I'm not perfect.. and you really don't have to pay me back.. I'd actually prefer if you didn't... it makes me feel useful for at least one thing.... yeah, not perfect :/ goodnight and sweet dreams
please don't. also.. would you like it if I paid you for the help you gave me for mowing those lawns?
sure?. Fifty dollars.. sounds like a lot
that could get you a bunch of Christmas gifts
it couldn't be a bunch. like.. 4 things. you could like.. buy mario kart. or like.. Just Dance 3
well like.. it's yours. sorry. forget it then
You did a fantastic job. I'm just sorry that you had to mow with me. of all the people to do boring things with
I'm sorry. you probably have things to get to. so I shouldn't keep you. I didn't even deserve to keep you this long..
that's silly. maybe.. I deserve this orange juice . but.. that's the most. sorry
I suppose. sorry.. I'm not too great. and being in the presence of a princess is making me nervous
You
the prettiest princess of all the land
and I'm but a peasant 
Sorry, your highness. But I am but a lowly shoe cobbler 
those are the keebler elves
I don't think so. I would like to call you a princess. because that's what you are
I wish I could do that :/. I'd probably see you if you were okay, kiss your "boo boo," hug you and then start a snowball fight. which isn't the same :/. or even distract you by making a snow angel and have you do the same. and THEN start the snowball fight
sorry :/. I can't say anything right. :(
I love you too. but I'm not good enough for a princess. :/
You're not average though. and okay. that should probably be goodnight then
where was that from?
how am I sentimental?. maybe.. mental. I don't know. well, I don't deserve you, I know that for sure.... so bye, eat an awesome dinner. and I have pumpkin pie. bye the way. if a chance to make pumpkin smores ever did occur
I don't :/. I don't even think I'm the "right one"
I mean for you. but thanks. but I might just be a little bit bruised 
I don't think you're confused]
I wouldn't say so
positive?
I love you too (:
sorry. you need to go get your dinner
well both then. have fun and goodnight. sweet dreams. and have an amazing sleep
I'll remember mine too. maybe. and there's nothing to thank me for
are you should I don't have to be. because I'm pretty sure I couldn't be any other way. ?*
wow I I said should... instead of sure. I'm not amazing though. but bye though. sweet dreams again. still, I'm pretty sure I couldn't be any other way. so.. I wish I were better
but I couldn't be any more perfect :P. not that.. I'm perfect.... goodnight
nah... bye
why do you always bring up the puppy-kicking?. but.. the family-eating is new. sorry.. bye
oh it's fine... it just makes me think that you expect me to do it one day. the only thing I would do it shove it out of the way.. or something. like.. pick it up with my foot. hop 20 feet. and the drop it on a couch. then go to where I was planning on going. and then it would get back in the way. and i'd be like.. "you win this time". sorry. well bye
I hope I don't do something pretty bad. yeah, could only do that with a cute puppy. and he'd just keep coming back. then lick my face. we both know who the master is. :P. sorry.. goodnight. have cute puppy dog dreams :3
I'm not perfect. so that I can play with the puppy?. sorry.. I hope you're in mine. night. :#. :3 *
you can play with it too :D. bye
and we'd just be like "puppy!!!". "it's so cute"
You're so cute
nope. not me at all
me neither
I can be your dog?
I could even wear like.. puppy ears
and carry the ball with my teeth. or.. you know... my hands. and then beg. and.. roll over. and kick my leg if you scratch behind my ear. sorry.. bye
really? :3
I has a ball :D
well.. I might be missing the arms. but I think I can do it 
awww.. sorry for keeping you so long :/. bye
I'm sorry :/. oh, good luck on the SAT and remember.. they don't allow mechanical pencils :P
that's awesome :D
I'm been okay, how about you?
because you did. victory cake!!
If I had some.. I'd give it to you. because you deserve it
I do have pumpkin pie.. but it's probably not the same
aw.. I don't have any marshmallows :/
okay
I don't know.. I think you missed one
aww
I should be there to warm them up :3
the eraser dust could still attack you. it probably followed you home. o.o
pretty much
way better. floating #2 pencils . anyway, you probably had a long day already
so I should probably let you get to things
track practice?. crazy. you're just going to be doing everything :P
whoa. you should go break it in. but.. not break it
22 (:
yeah, I should let you get to things. so have fun 
what do I have to get to?
nah.. probably average stuff
that sounds silly
well for now.. you don't have to. you've got stuffs to do
well then you could get stuffs done now before 4
whoa.. me too :P
I could imagine. nothing better to do when your brain dead but to play videogames 
we?. wouldn't it be more fun with someone cool?
it totally would be. I'm glad you agree
nope. sorry
for what?. never mind.. you seem busy
it's okay, you were probably doing something important. something more important than me at least.. so have fun with it (:
it's cold out
and they'll keep you warm 
there you go. and that's who wears scarves these days. well.. it was nice talking to you?
battle!!!. I like battles. when they involve tennis. and the Wii. and you. :P. sorry. I suppose your going.. so bye
or if track ends early. sorry. kidding. I'm not cool
it would be cool. either way I should let you get to things. so.. have fun
haha. sounds like fun
I hope so too
well, have fun. bye :D. sorry
I love you too, Leandra :3
bye bye
tah tah for now :3
your sillyhead. forever and always. sorry
you're cute :3. and I hope you have lots of fun today. sorry. bye
well.. it doesn't matter either way. I have to go be a shepard . shepherd*. :/. I didn't know it was today. so I'm sorry. but you're not even there to read this.. . so have fun anyway. I know I won't.... :/. You're probably busy talking to someone more important.. or something else.. and there's probably no hope for tomorrow... *sigh*.. you're not there. bye :/. sorry.. you probably don't care. goodnight and sweet dreams for later. :/
sorry, gotta go.. and no llamas, I don't think 
bye :/
I wish you could've been there :/. sorry.. well, goodnight and sweet dreams *sigh*.... have a good day tomorrow (:. sorry..

okay (:
Bye for now 
You're super cute :3. bye
I love you too! :3 but I can't say words well :/
I'm sorry.. I don't think I do.. I sort of just try to "act cool" but I think I make more of a fool when I try to :P. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams :3
okay, just one more day :P but I'm not cool :P but I might become cool if I walk home from robotics anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams! (:. super sweet dreams . sorry. sorry, I saw the green dot.. but I guess you're not there.. so bye and goodnight and see you tomorrow. I was really hoping you had been there, but that's like hoping for snow I guess. :/ I'll miss you
I hope your testing experience went smoothly, including the lockdown stuffs. I hope you get home safe n' stuff too
see?. Called it :D
I don't know.. just did. magic?
sorry.. you probably have things to get to. and sure?. but yeah, have fun with things
for what?. you don't have to. it'd be silly
you sure?. it better not start with a "t"
but you have the jacket. it's in your possession 
I love you too :3
what did you want to call me for?. oh, I did
aw, well I guess that means you won't be calling then. yeah, a bunch of time in physics
in graphics*. without.. physics. sorry, my hands are cold
because they have no hand to hold
but yeah, you can call if you like
I'm guessing you had plenty of time for that?. aww.. it's not the same
there's someone pretty special that keeps my hands warm
you?
if you want to be anyway
it's just overall cold in my house
good idea :D. well anyway, have a nice dinner then (:. I'll put the phone away :P. bye :D
I don't have too much laying around.. but thanks (:

I love you :3. sorry, I said that before I left.. you probably don't care
I hope you do too :D but without you.. I don't know how awesome it can be :P
I don't know.. I wish there was a way. if there's a Wii there's a way.. I mean.. will* :3. sorry, thought of that just then :P I hope you had fun and did well :D (I'm sure you did)
Aw.. I wish I could be there for you... I hope it's all fun though :D
I'm glad you made it home safe :3 I love you so so so much too (:. you're way more amazing. goodnight and sweet dreams! I'm sure you're very sleepy and tired so I hope your dreams are really amazing (:

waking up is nice :D. well I'm glad you're okay :D
Aww. I'm sorry
mostly?
shouldn't you be completely safe?
Makes sense . I like your voice, I hope it's not gone forever 
haha
I miss you too. sorry.. I'm silly
what?. You're cute and perfect. I'm just silly
Do I get some sort of plaque stating so?
hearts don't eat things. stomaches eat things. silly
I think I listened to all of the songs
random, but yeah. I think I did it
I liked a lot of them :D
Don't you know your my favorite girl?
I liked that one
that doesn't rhyme with world 
I bet. You're favorite guy must love it when you sing that song
oh.. well I think he'd love it regardless
I think I lo-ove you too :#. :3 *
You're super cute (:
my day has been okay I suppose, yours?
or maybe wearing my hoodie. ?*
cuteness? :3
:3. You're so amazing (:. but I think... we need to... BATTLE!!. sometime. if you wanted
of course you can (:. if you wanted
fine, I will be all like "BRING IT On"
I bet you would be
!!!. Run!!. @.@
aw, better luck next time. and I mean it. because next time it'll be ready
yes?. please don't say I got you sick
it's probably just cold
you just need someone to give you a warm hug
well.. I don't know any bears. but my arms are always available
maybe not the bestest. but I can try
that's silly
you're cute
it is too . and you know it (:
speaking of winter... wait.. never mind
!!. shh... that. and something else :P
shhh.... it's a secret
a secret secret. but.. I don't know the difference between those two
I wish I could see you today
I guess you're too busy
well I can do my best to stop you from shivering 
and battles.. are known cures for shivering
do you have that chicken noodle soup?. that could help too :D
see you. I think that's a pretty good activity
(:. That would be amazing :3
I know I'm crazy... I'm sorry. but it's worth it :D
I like you too (:
I hope it's delicious (:
what secret secret?
well I don't know :P
I'd have to see you at some time
but I suppose.. I don't know
anyway, have fun with your chicken soup (:. yeah, that... you probably wouldn't want me to see you
aw... I can bike over to you. and help make little gingerbread men :D. we can always shape them without a cutter . if all else fails. or I can try to find one . (: ? 
okay, have fun with lunch and everything
then it's all like "no"
you don't have all the ingredients?
molasses is just like.. syrup. except.. not. I guess
woah. that's like.. perfect. :D
everyone has butterscotch pudding, don't they?
I can check (:
aw... every flavor BUT butterscotch
I found french vanilla
probably not
I guess that means I can battle with you then :/
I've never made one either
aw.. okay then
I guess. aw.. so much for wishes
nah. I bet she just doesn't like me
your mother?
aww.. okay. I wanted to give you something
but I suppose it can stay a secret
bye
maybe..
but I guess you'll never find out
or never find out. I'm not cool though
oh you can't find out tomorrow
no it's.. . never mind
I'll let you go get to stuffs
okay
I love you too. you probably won't be able to guess it
okay... maybe you will be able to guess it
just kidding. but that's a good idea
also good ideas
if you say so. but I don't think you'll find out tomorrow
we'll see
have fun with stuffs
well there wouldn't be a Wii, would there be?. thank me for nothing :P
bye. n' tah tah for now. I'll miss you. sorry..
there is tomorrow. but we couldn't battle then. :P. sorry :P. bye cutie pie :3. sorry.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I love you so so so much :3
You're so amazing.. I totally wrote you another note.. but I suppose you will never get it :P unless I got it to you tonight.. yeah :P
but there's one more note :P but I'm glad I made your day... well the stuff I did at least :P I hope it was amazing and goodnight and sweet dreams if I don't get the chance to say it later (:. I love you so so so much :3. Hello.. I think that maybe looking at your porch/porch steps would be cool.. maybe? (:
You're so amazing, my favorite girl :3 Don't forget you're cute, and I'm sorry for just getting this, I just got back from the open house.. so goodnight and sweet dreams.. I love you too (:. sorry.. I walked by your house on the way home from track today. I thought about leaving you a note but.. I felt pretty late to begin with... but umm, goodnight and sweet dreams (: I hope you feel better-ish tomorrow :D
it was good. I suppose. How was the sam mail?
yeah, wel. well*. I hope you're having a good day (:
well you should go finish everything then!
I couldn't go to track. because of the orthodontist appointment
anyway, I shouldn't take up any of your time. I'll let you do your homework
It's okay. You're busy
why?. You're amazing. ly busy. sorry.. kidding. but you're amazing too :3. and perfect :D
I bet it's adorable :D. and if not.. then it should be
you sure?. I believe in you :D
challenge accepted. It's almost break (:
I hope you have a lot of fun
I don't know about me.. but thanks
I don't know... because I'd like to see someone over the break.. but they'd probably be pressed for time. what's the assignment like?
well they could be. who knows. I don't know.. I'm not going to get my hopes up.. plus she lost her voice.. so she probably wouldn't want me around then either... 
I think my only chance would be if I gave her a gift or something.. but for a second. or maybe you would make a squeaky singular person
well I wouldn't want to bother her. and I was just saying that the only chance I would have would be if I got her a gift.. for Christmas. besides.. why would she want to hang out with me in the first place.. it's a break and she sees me all the time anyway
nah.. she probably wouldn't care
no you wouldn't...
if you say so.... I was totally talking about you though
never mind.... if you don't know by now. then I guess it doesn't matter
I'll let you get to your homework. bye and goodnight. sweet dreams and everything
no, it's fine... I've wasted enough of your time
I'm sorry.... I'm so lame. bye...
I love talking to you... I'm just sorry
I'm sorry :/. bye..
goodnight
okay. wii battle
oh.. I wasn't joking. but I guess that means no wii battle...
oh it's okay. you made it quite clear to me that you wouldn't want to see me.... anyway.. bye...
the pokes are okay
nothing.. just forget about it
yes. well.. bye
hmm?
I really like you too
bye cutie pie
:/
I love you too.. and I'm sorry if I like the hand holding.... sorry... I'll get out of your way n' everything
you don't have time for me..
nah.. but I should be letting you get to stuffs. because I keep wasting your time
have fun
we'll see
but who knows..
rawr to you too
have a good break.. even if I'm not in it. especially if I'm not in it
well I'd like to be with you
well, have fun with homework. I'll get out of your way so you can get to work
if you say so
tah tah for now..
Did you finally find the note in it?. sorry I didn't get that earlier.. I just got home.. walking, by the way. It's freezing I might add and it was really dark
My fingers are numb :/
Oh, well.. I walked by.. but I didn't want to bother anyone 
you weren't stalkery.. at the least I was because I walked by..  and so far my hands are still super cold. anyway.. I'm going to go because you probably don't have time for me.. just like everyone else
I don't know if they are.. but maybe.. and there are plenty of better of people to talk to. and.. no one has time for me :/
you sent that twice . sorry.. like I said.. you have no time for me.. so have a good rest of your day. goodnight and sweet dreams
I'll try... you too
Lucky. oh well. have fun
aw.. darn, I'm not ready right now :P. I mean.. I'm pretty ready. but.. not ready ready. but it's okay. you have fun
oh umm.. like.. a few moments of time
I took the time that you took to respond to get mostly ready
well that was what I was wearing.. but I was so super fast that I'm at least in pants and a t-shirt
I'll go see if I'm allowed, but I do really want to come. if you want me to
I am allowed :P
and now I have shoes and a sweater. my hair's a mess though
I'll wear a hat. bye (:
for what? :P I can't wait till you do either. Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I hope you have a fantastic day today (: sorry.... :/. I hope you had an awesome day.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:. well.. I hope you have a great day.. sorry for all the messages, you probably won't read this one either
you gotta get to that project if it's that exciting
oh, I'm sorry
well I suppose I should let you work on your thingy
It's not creepy.. I actually kinda missed you
but starting the thingy would be a better use of your time
You could discover something new or.. make what has already been done go smoother and faster. I don't know, things like that
Or if you don't know how you could contribute you could be like "And I can bring muffins to motivate people. "*
you haven't
I would help if I could
okay.. creativity and technical stuffs. well.. you hear about those "Goldilocks" planets from your mom, right?
Relate something to that
well.. you're just going to have to develop light speed
goin' into hyper drive
well I suppose my day is okay... I've been thinking about you a lot (if that's not creepy at all). sorry. but umm.. yeah. how has yours been?
That's good 
are you going to live?
I hope so too. oH. :P
did I hear chicken noodle soup?
I want to make you some
or something..
and bring it to you (:
seeing you would be neat
No one has been on the dark side of the moon.. imagine what's over there
I would see a cute squeaky, unhealthy person. That I love so so so much
it's still you though :3. I don't care if your squeaky and unhealthy
Whoa.. I've never heard of that. Gingerbread houses :D
!!. I don't have Tarzan on dvd :/. I have a vhs player that works though :P
yeah, I totally watched a movie on it
it has a dvd player built into it, but that part doesn't work. Camp Nowhere. but hey, maybe it is on netflix. I don't see why it wouldn't be. it has everything on it
yes. you could say that
it's a comedy. with Christopher Lloyd in it
pretty much (:. anyway, I should let you get to your project. and food eating if you haven't done that yet
well I believe in you. I'm not amazing
nah.. that's silly. but yeah, good luck with everything. and there's plenty to write about, you're creative n' everything (:. You shouldn't have a problem. I'll continue to miss you n' whatnot 
Sghetti Tacos sound really neat, along with gingerbread houses and chicken noodle soup
I won't get my hopes up though
yeah, especially if it never happens. Dylan Sprouse was in a movie called "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" . it was crazy.. I saw like a second and he was all.. 10 or something. but yeah, not a lot of stuff happening with the dark side of the moon. less stuff has been discovered on Earth though.. I don't know why we wouldn't just stay down here
:P
sorry, I'm being random
Exactly.. or the ocean
exactly. anyway, have fun and good luck. I love you! :3 sorry... umm... bye
gingerbread dough! for those houses
like trees. and a mailbox. and bears 
Yes! :D. Especially a cabinet
one to hold the breakables
I don't know if they do or not.. but we should. and then eat their bathtub . and be like "ow.. my tummy... I can't believe I ate that entire bathtub"
ate everything but the kitchen sink
up.. no, ate that too
well.. bye bye cutie pie. I wish to see you sometime over break, so.. here's to wishful thinking
whoa.. that's suspenseful . bye, Leandra :3. I think you're pretty. sorry.. good luck with everything!
there's an infinite amount of stuff to write about
whoa.. I could indeed
you give me butterflies too :3
Well they better start attacking you :P or I'll give them a piece of my mind
maybe!. I'm sure Mr. Snail with the mail will deliver the ideas to you :3
good idea!
It could monitor debris that could attack the planet
and aliens
something that could emit atmospheric gases . since we are losing much of the ozone layer. we could just.. spew oxygen :P
It is. it's probably hard to do. but it would be practical :D. and you don't have to have all of the answers
they did :D
yes :D. do it (:. it would make it less hot there. and it would stop stuffs from melting and flooding the whole world 
you.. are a genius 8)
or you're a super genius. I mean, it's a start to ideas
by putting something in space you could potentially slow down global warming. so why not write about that?
yes, just some research and the fallacies involved . and you could be on your way to saving the planet :D
And I'm not helping, it's all you
cool :D
I'll get out of your way so you can concentrate. sand tends to reflect uv light. I don't know if that helps. just put a giant sand pit in space
or fix the ozone because it absorbs most of it. but since there's a hole up there.. you know. it's becoming harder to absorb the rays
I mean.. . you know. the hole is being created from like.. . O3 getting up in space
it's taking away from the ozone
so if we just sent more.. not that stuff
it would be good
what if emitting less isn't helping? o.o. what if we need to emit more good stuff. it could like.. counterbalance the bad stuff. and then like.. magically fix everything
aww... maybe they don't
yeah!
send a plant into space. and it'll make everything better
I'm mostly joking. yeah
if there were floating gardens..
we could make everything better :D
I mean.. why not though?
It could.. work. maybe. exactly
I don't know.. I'm just trying to help :P
well I should let you concentrate though
sorry
make a filter in space
it'll suck up O3 n' bad stuff. filter out what we emit into space. or both o.o. I don't know.. but best of luck (:
aw.. man you might be right. it's the carbon stuff that takes away from it. or something. I knew it was important though
well I feel silly now :P. bye though
I love you too :3
And I only want to help so you get done and have time for awesome stuff. or so that you can do super amazingly awesome
nah, like you :3. good luck on research! I hope your paper is super awesome :D
don't thank me. I didn't do anything
have fun though!. Bye :D. You're so special to me :3
I'm happy too :3. I'm the luckiest guy ever (:. bye (:. have fun
you're the best thing ever :3. bye. I don't think my Christmas gift is going to be that fantastic :/. :'(. I'm going to leave you a note if you don't mind. sorry
I found that leaf like that :P
aw it's okay..
I can always go back though.. there was something that I forgot . and you can say hi..
I was going to stay out there longer but my bikelights battery died
but I changed the battery and it's all ready to go
why tomorrow morning?. I mean.. you don't have to see me at all
That would be cool. but it's okay
that's pretty darn tall
I'm sure it will fit
if there's a will.. there's a way
did you get the tennis ball?. or did it roll away
?*
it's no problem.. it's just a tennis ball
I hope to get you something better for Christmas
is the bracelet broken?. because I can fix it..
oh, well.. I'm sorry for that. I don't think I got you the best thing ever. not yet at least
if you sayso. say so*
sorry
what?
I love you too.... but I might have to go on another little bike ride. I'll just be sure to avoid your house because you said no
I think track practice would get in the way tomorrow morning :/
any other part of the day would do. but I guess it wouldn't for you
oh, it's fine. I wouldn't want to be in the way of anything
I guess someone else will have to
I'm no fun anyway
I was writing on my leg. because there was nothing else to write on
yeah
I would like to make spaghetti tacos and explore with you. but you seem busy. I could always try and get out of practice tomorrow.. but who knows..
Well practice is a bit inconvenient tomorrow.. but okay.. I'll go
I suppose I should let you get that report done though
or really good at sports
sounds like some pretty serious stuff from your doctor. I'm glad your listening . anyway, you should try to get that report done. because it sounds like a bunch of fun
I'm glad that you didn't. have fun with the report. I'll let you get to it
you don't have to. it's fine. you should get to important stuff
you really don't have to
she's not home
you don't have to though.. I'm not important
I think the report takes precedence over me
could I lock you in a room until you finish?
because I want you to finish
it's okay.. you don't have to call me.. it would only waste more of your time. get to the other stuffs
It's not necessary though. and although I'd.. like it. you should be doing better things
no.. better things
don't be sorry
I'm sorry for being lame. because I'm not cool.....
I'm sorry. you shouldn't be nervous
have fun with things. I'm so lame
you're voice is amazing.. all the time. I'm sorry again for crying on your note that I left you.... sorry... umm.. bye. :/
bye :/ . goodnight and sweet dreams for later
if you say so. You're my favorite girl
I just want to be yours too. but I don't think I deserve you
I wish I could be the perfect guy
that sounds unbelievable 
You're like a dream but real, you came from your kingdom and found me in the streets.. there is no way a Princess like you could like a pauper like me
I hope it does, but only time will tell
and whether or not you come to your senses 
you're perfect to me.. and I like your ears 
It didn't. I thought it was cute
I think you're cute
tah tah for now, your majesty . No one can surely be As lovely as you are to me
Well.. you look cute  and with that I bid you adieu . Oh I love your smile As it takes away my breath It takes it for a while brings me close to death But you come to bring me back to life and all I can ask is for you to be my.... sigh.. rhyming is hard
You must go, you're mother requires it so But I'd like you to know as you depart you hold on my heart and I will wait so long as we are apart but when we do see each other again I hope to be able to hold you for no end. it just gets harder and harder to be creative. I'm sorry I shouldn't have made it. sorry..
that was amazing :3. it was like.. the cutest thing I've ever read. you should write it down and use it again :3
you're amazing.. I'm nothing close. but I do know I love you the most
I love you too :3
okay, have fun. bye bye
goodnight and sweet dreams for later

but.. you should go to your fun stuff.. so.. yeah. bye 
I think I can leave after saying that. You'll just have to find out the next time (if) I see you
it's not that special... but maybe one day
one day.. you can find out what it is.. or see me for that matter
but you're probably all busy this week.. . but it can wait
which makes you busy
well that's okay. I wouldn't ask you to do anything crazy
nah. she'd probably say no anyway
Christmas is a time for family.. not a time for some guy you know
I am free tomorrow
especially tomorrow
when did she say that?
If you want me over
we can do anything (:
I want to just do something
that would be a lot of fun :D
Puss in Boots is out like.. the 23rd?. Called it :D

Thank you, have bunches of fun doing whatever you do :D
okay, neat. aw.. I guess that means no chicken noodle soup :/. I was so looking forward to that :(

neat (:. thank you :D. I was going to do it either way if you said no. but thank you for letting me (:. have fun at lunch (:. aww, thank you so so so much :3

sorry. I don't know if you found it or not... and you probably won't get this message until later. I kinda wanted to hand it to you though. oh well. I hope everything was awesome for you. I think I'll walk over and grab it back, you probably wouldn't have wanted it anyway. bye
I'm sorry. I'm not . I'm going to go pick it up, if you don't mind
it's no trouble... none at all. so I'll do that. bye I guess :P
oh, you don't have to.. it'd be too much trouble
well you still don't have to. but thanks for the offer. anyway, bye bye
I mean.. I'm just snagging something. you probably wouldn't even notice
haha, if you wanted. but I was just going to pick something up. I guess you should ask then?
well okay..
I would do yard work. but I just wanted to get one little thing
It's nice outside
well it's all I wanted to do
that's probably why she wants to do yard work. I'll be like.. ninja. it'll be like I was never there
that's how I was able to leave it there in the first place. plus seeing me isn't that fun.... and you did that a lot yesterday. although.. yard work isn't too bad. I'd say it's fun.. and possibly a nice way to spend the day. plus there's only like.. an hour of sunlight left
that's silly... anyway.. I'm going to go get the thingy before it dies
it is.. pretty silly. anyway, bye
okay
aww, I'm sorry I'm home and there's nothing to worry about, I was slow though.. so I'm sorry.. I love you too, I'm just sorry for everything :/ I'm so lame Goodnight and sweet dreams!

You got this. I believe in you :D
I have to go, so no distractions from me. go go go :#. :3 *
Don't forget that I love you

You're a princess to me :3
but no time to argue. just go go go (:. Bye

but like.. do it just to do it too :D
I'll give you a big hug if you get done 
If that's good enough
no time, just write it. I has to go
so I'll be out of your hair. I love you :3
bye bye
Sweet caramel chocolate dreams (:
maybe.. smores. yeah!. bye. sorry for stuffs again. but go go go. I'll log out so you can get to it :3
bye cutie pie :3
you're super perfect :D. bye
You're so cute :3. http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/crossculturaldesserts/r/gingerbread.htm. yes :P. haha, sorry (:. I'm sorry :/. I. I'm the worst guy ever :/
How could that be embarrassing? I thought you looked cute. and I love you too.. I'm just.. so terrible :(. You probably can't do it any time soon though.. and I guess Puss in Boots is out of the question for now. I hope you got your thingy done. have a good day, and I'll drop the iron on transfers off sometime later in the day
don't apologize for that. I don't mind (:
I love you gingerbread dough much. sorry.. umm.. hi
they did. did yours?. and when would you like the iron on transfers?
yes
if you still want it of course. sorry..
I'm prepared. I read that as tackles . well.. tackleness. :P. sorry. silly. umm... I'm so prepared. when would you like the stuffs?
got me. anyway, how soon do you want the iron on transfer paper?
I don't want you to pick it up in the cold. I can deliver it
if you say so. but it wouldn't be a problem. but whenever you want it
there are instructions. unless you just want to use that as an excuse for me to teach you :P
it is. did you finish your thingy?
I trust you. well.. at least you got some of it done, right? (: 
that's still worth like.. a medium sized hug
that movie's playing at the lyric tonight
It could be. fun*
yeah :3
me too. well umm.. I'm sure you're busy. I'll let you get to things
that'd be fun, but you don't have to
it doesn't have to look exactly like that one
exactly. I was thinking of making gingerbread Santa. and make like.. a sleigh and reindeer n' all that stuffs. and give that to Santa :D. but that'd be really complicated.. or something
nah
they make sleigh cookie cutters.. and reindeer ones
dough probably does work like clay
but we could just use a knife and cut them out. anyway.. you seem really busy.. or distracted.. so I'll let you get to stuffs
well get to your drawing thingy. it sounds important. oh.. and if you want. you could outline it in pen. scan it into adobe illustrator 
and use live trace and convert to live paint
then it'd be all colored and everything
I love you too, Leandra :3
I don't know what you're drawing... just suggestions so that you color it or something
when I draw stuffs I don't want to mess up the original so I scan it into the computer and do all that stuffs to it
that way it looks neat. but I can just draw in illustrator to begin with. but okay, have fun with chores n' whatnot. :P. bye
oh, or what you can do is use the pen tool and just draw around the original drawing. they can be super cute :D
as cute as you want them I guess
and take away the drawing.. then live paint the stuffs you did
sorry.. you probably already new all this stuffs. but bye bye cutie pie
you sure?. so like.. you can drag your drawing in.. or right click and open with: Adobe Illustrator
live paint and live trace are both in "Object". Next to Edit. which is next to File
and you can change your live trace tracing options to make it look better. clicking preview always helps because it shows you the final output 
sorry.. I'm just trying to make sure you know everything you would need to know
well like.. live trace can take out some detail
so you can change the threshold 
changing the threshold can always help. so yeah, call me if you need any more help
but I think you should be set if you wrote all that down :D
I'm sure you can figure it out too (:
good luck with whatever it is
chores and everything. sounds so crazy
you must be a superhero to get it all done
You're like.. Princess by day.. crime fighting vigilante by night. whoa.. you're so perfect. you could have any guy you wanted . and they still probably wouldn't be good enough. but you could still have them
aww.. someone else likes you? :/
see.. that's why I was confused.. because I'm not a perfect guy :P
a whole hour you could've been doing chores. I'm sorry. go do your stuffs. have fun
if you say so. but yeah, go go go. and have bunches of fun. my leg kinda hurts... so I'm going to see what I can do about that
well it's been hurting a little
towards my ankle
but still my leg. but I don't quite think it's my shin
my other leg hurt bunched yesterday
and it stopped when I woke up
but when I woke up the other leg was hurting. so I think it'll get better soon 
but yeah, it's not important.. go do your chores and things
bye bye sweetie pie
(changed it up this time :3 ). bye
you're so perfect. sorry.. bye
poke. you're super amazing ^_^
nah, not me :P
I hope you're getting everything done alright (:
that you are?\. Oh, neat :D
is that a question?. (: ?
well.. I do like challenges
I do :D
that they are :D. but I'm still kinda lost whether or not it was a question
whoa.. a new profile photo?
It's cute (:
no, you're cute. and I like popsicles . :P
so.. umm... gingerbread housie?
cool
whoa.. what does that mean?. I've finger knitted before. the tides of yule thing though :P
they are . whoa.. so fast with the pokes. aww.. but you're all gone now. well.. have fun with stuffs.. like gingerbread houses and.. other Christmas-y stuff. even Puss in Boots. bye
no.. they're just super fast. like the flash
mhmm. sorry.. umm, maybe I should let you get to stuffs
that'd be fun. but I wasn't sure you wanted to
let. 's do it
although that was probably a no from her
I have flour and corn syrup
yes
but we could always make it out of graham crackers?. It's edible.. but not for eating
we'd just need icing and graham crackers
and we have marshmallows. for like.. snow n' stuff. I live right next to 7/11. I can pick up stuff on the way
if you want to
it would be silly
how about a list?. what would you like on it?
gumdrops . and gummy stuffs. I think we'd need to rely heavily on icing. do you think you have enough?
okay, I'll see what I can do
maybe I could bike to food lion
it might have a broader selecetion. selection*
and 7/11 is more expensive than it
it's not that far (:
and?. It won't be a problem
I could be super fast (:. I don't know.. icing and candy
pretty much all I could think of
I can buy icing (:. and or.. look for some
I'll get more (:
I have like.. 80 dollars with your name on it. so don't even be talking :P. anyway, how quickly do you want to start?
okay, I'll hop on my bike and be on my way
okay, another coat. got it. and pick up stuff from food lion. check
I've walked there from approximately your house once before. so it's not too far
uh uh :3. I have left over gummy bears. .... okay, I'll just drop by 7/11 then
yes (:. see ya soon :D. bye bye cutie pie :3. I gotta go gotta go gotta go to tha store
bye
sorry for making you sooo sleeping :3 I hope you slept really well :D. I hope you're having a fantastic Christmas Eve so far (:. Hello (:
it's okay :3
thanks (:. you shouldn't be sorry for falling asleep on me though. that's what I'm there for :P
Lonesome Doves
or.. just Lonesome Dove. But no, I was there for you :D. and what are boyfriends for? :3. They're for sleeping on 
and when you're tired of having adventures n' stuff.. you can take naps on them. they're very versatile 
blankets are nice :3
You're the nicest :D
sorry
you're also the cutest. and Santa can't take that away from you
you probably have stuffs to get to, seeing how it's Christmas Eve n' everything. so I should let you get to stuffs (:
aw, not me.. . if only, but that's okay. but hey! It's almost Christmas :D. and you should get to your stuffs. at most I'd go pick up my bike from a persons house.. it's not as cold as it was yesterday (:
yeah :D
I bet you're gonna leave Santa some pretty tasty cookies :D
well.. maybe he'll come twice?. Maybe it was just an Elf that came by and dropped it off. just because Santa thought it was so important :P
and that's how it'll totally work out :D. anyway, go have bunches of fun with Christmas Eve!
awesome (:. I hope it's great. and that you have a great Merry Christmas
Can I pick up my bike sometime?
whoa.. when would dinner be?
oh, neat (:
Okay, I'll be sure to check. that's exciting :3
and you shouldn't worry about my bike
I'm kinda wanting it so that I could possibly fix the kickstand 
Oh, well umm.. before you go. can I get my bike?
Just at some.. random time.. when I pick it up?
okay.. I don't know when I'll do it.. but it'll happen at some point. oh and... I love you so so so much, Leandra :3 You're the bestest girlfriend any guy could ever ask for :3. and I'll randomly pop by. probably just.. snatch my bike from your back yard. and bye :D. Have a nice day :D
It was all fun ^_^
anyway, go have fun (:
the toppled one?
I'll be sure to leave a note saying "I stole this bike" . just so you know that it's safe with me. sorry for wasting so much of your time. bye bye. cutie pie :3
It'll probably be soon.. so you'd have to sleep with both eyes open. bye :D
sorry. nah, I'm not cool. sorry :/
is it hard?. do you need help?. I have fabric pens. :D !!!. that you could even borrow, if you like (:. aww.. I missed you... I'm sorry :/
you sure?
okay.. are you in illustrator right now?
okay. so go to object. and live trace the outline that you have. you can even go to tracing options. okay?
okay, did you trace it?
okay, now that it's traced go to live paint. also in object. and choose "Make" in the options
did you scan in the image already?. and does it have color?. It works best if it is black and white and is in pen
Oh, okay... that's cooler :D
okay, umm so highlight it all. go to your selection tool. it's the black mouse. or.. arrow :D. and select it all
then live paint
that should do it. do you have that?
okay, good :D. and then go to the live paint bucket. which just looks like a paint bucket
and make sure your color guide is open
because then you can just choose colors and fill them in where they need to be
oh, meant just the color toolbox
color guide takes the original color and gives your tints/shades of that color and complimentary colors to go with it
so yeah, now that it's in a live paint group and you are using the paint bucket you can just choose different colors in the selection you have and fill it in
it's sort of like.. ms paint, but more detailed. do you have colors?
okay, bring your paint bucket over an area in your drawing
and it should bright up red. that means you can paint it
oh, there are two colors. no worries (:. okay, you could be changed the outline. and not the actual color. Hmm?
okay, gray square with red line though it means that it's blank
whoa.. we could skype and you could screen share
and I can show you what to do 
Wait. we could skype and I can screenshare. and I'll give you like.. a tutorial :D
you sure?
because I think I could explain it better if we did that
and it's no trouble. aww.. okay. I have fabric pens?. I could bring those to you 
please, we can skype?. or something? :D. I really want to help
is it becoming red when you bring the bucket over it?
you sure you have a color selected?
top box is inside and bottom box is outline. can I show you on skype?
please? :(
don't show it to me.. just make a new sketch on another one. and I'll have mine screen shared so you can see what I'm doing
oh.. maybe you didn't fill in all of the gaps. because when you make a sketch and live paint it
if the gaps aren't filled it won't paint. so every line needs to meet the other lines
sometimes you need to zoom in
what do you mean by that?
oh, yeah I think it should work still
hmm.. . you sure about skype?
I think I can explain things better if I see it and if like.. I can talks 
oh, hey, told you
so is it working?
awesome :D
you are silly :3. and don't be sorry :D. I hope I helped a lil'
double click on your already selected color. like.. the one in the little box. it'll be called "color picker"
does that help?. because that's the only way I know how
okay, click on it. and hit control x. sorry, command x
oh, I'm on a mac. sorry. umm... you can select it and delete it. command x just copies it. however that's an apple shortcut
you can always go to edit and cut
like.. live paint?
do you not want to have live paint anymore?. like.. you want it to be.. no live paintable any more
?*. oh, you can draw those lines. and then hit merge in live paint. it's below make
but release removes it. but it also removes all of the colors that you have. but merge can take one drawing and put the other into the same live paint group
oh, that's because your whole thing is selected
use the selection tool again and click somewhere else
away from the live paint subject. and then you should be good :D
I'd say you're doing great as a beginner :D. and, if you like, you can select all of it and take away the outlines (all of them) and that way the extra lines n' whatnot won't be there and it would look a tad bit smoother 
well if there's nothing else to merge it won't show up. if you add something new it'll show up. you just have to make sure you highlighted everything
or "selected" it all
well, it's something I like to do I suppose
well with practice it's really fast
but games are fun :D. Yeah, I can get something done in no time
shape tool. hit shift. and boom. perfect. you can even hit alt and it will spread out from the cursor 
I bet yours was great :D
under type tool. which is in the shape of a "T". sorry.. totally under the line tool
yes it is. click and hold on it. and it gives you more options. like circles n' stars
sorry... the shape tool is under the line tool
okay, good. I'm sorry. I was probably being confusing
awesome (:. I'm glad it's working for you . I've never had to teach someone stuffs. well.. there was this one time. but we don't speak of that
whatever color you like? :D. It's up to you, you're the artist with the vision :D
ahhh. zoom out zoom out zoom out!!. it's scary in the white o.o
I don't know what you mean by that. do you mean like.. when you draw one and want to draw a new?. you'd have to deselect the one you are already on. and then start a new one and the new one won't mess the other one up
get your select tool and click somewhere else
hmm.. 
you can copy it 
and just.. drag it somewhere and keep it safe
you sound really amazing (:
you sound cool :D
it's really okay (:
direct selection tool :D. it's under the selection tool
yes :D
and you can select a certain point and hit delete and it'll be gone
sorry.. I'm lost by that question. even with the added note. like.. if you wanted a line for the nose... you'd add one?. like that kinda detail?. you can either redraw it or use the direct select tool on the certain line and change it's outline. if that's what you're asking
You're amazing and worth every bit of time (:
and if you like, I could give you a more in depth lesson. or something (:
like.. one day that I see you. neat (:
I can't wait for midnight :D. so I can be all like "Merry Christmas!!!". just to you though :3
aww, that sounds like so much trouble. but sweet :3. you're so sweet :D. I love you (:. sorry..
well just don't rush yourself. maybe if you stay up late enough.. Santa can give you a lift in his sled :D
yeah :D. and he'd be all like "Wanna cookie?". and it'd be so cool. and you'd be like "Whoa.. this is way cooler than anything ever!!!"
eventually you'd be like "I forgot why I'm here.. but this is so fun I don't even care!"
oh, it's okay
yeah, you'd completely forget about me :P. but yeah, now that you know somewhat what you need to do I'll leave you to it so that you aren't too distracted by me
neat (:
"a little?"?. but neat (:
if you ever get to ironing on stuff, be sure to read the instructions thoroughly 
you can
if you scan it in you can draw on it
no problem :D
anyway, I'll let you continue with it. oh and with ripping the transfer paper... you gotta be careful with that stuff
and even if you don't think it'll rip.. it'll rip eventually
(you're supposed to rip it, just don't rip the transfer). you're amazing though :3. and I should let you get to your stuffs without a distraction :D
I don't think I'm as good as the paperclip, but thank you :D. goodnight and sweet dreams :3. You're so perfect (:. oh, and Merry Christmas if I can't say it later (or at least at midnight). have fun with illustrator :D
bye bye cutie pie (:
oh and I think I'd be able to go to that Christmas dinner.. if you'd still want me there. sorry.. I don't know.. umm, bye
go ahead :D
the outline box under the color box. it's up there by the color guide :D
no problem (:
no, just use the selection tool (if it's not grouped) or the direct selection tool (if it is grouped) and you can just choose your outline color. oh, and by the way, I love you, Leandra :3. so so so much ^_^
haha, you're so silly :3
It was nice
I love you too (:. Goodnight and I hope your Christmas Eve was amazing and everything you thought it could be :D
yes!! :D. that would be really nice.. maybe tomorrow night?
it's fine if you don't. but it'd be a Christmas Miracle if you do
yes :D. But it'd still be okay (:. I wasn't expecting anything, so it sounds really nice :D. I love you!. sorry..
Bye (:. I hope I helped at least a little bit. :3
well I'm glad (:. anything for you :3
you're so so so amazing (:
I bet it's amazing
like you :3. you're so amazing though :D
I don't even know how you do it
uh uh, you are :3
:D. I like you (:
haha. you're so cute :3
Hi :D. you're neat :D
I think you're pretty amazing yourself :3. you're also pretty :D. well.. you seem to be gone.. I'm guessing busy.. so umm, bye bye . Merry Christmas, Leandra!!! I hope it's amazing! (: I love you so so so much! :3
I beat you :D. I gotchu :3. You're amazing (:. goodnight/good morning :D. See you later I hope :3
I will :D. Bye bye . Go sleep (:. and sleep well :3. I love you so so so much!. bye cutie pie. sorry..... bye

What was in it?

it probably won't 
yes :D
umm.. sure?
yeah, sure :P
really? I didn't think I sounded that way at all :P
me too. wjpa. whoa*
I totally typed all funny by accident
well I was thinking of going over to my girlfriends house.. . but who knows
they aren't
I'm absolutely positive. unless you don't want me there anymore. then I understand
we actually did a lunch sort of thing
ah, if it's too crowded then I can just stay home
I could just get the stuff with my name on it at your house?
okay, awesome (:. I'll try to be there on time
okay, have fun 
bye :D. you're cooler :D
Merry Christmas to you too :3
haha, I'm thankful for you too :3
have fun and see you at 8
yeah, I'm not going anywhere
that's silly
okay. I'll keep being alone :P. that's fine though (:
haha, neat. I was ditched here a while ago :P. but yeah, go have fun and I'll wait until 8:30
I'm not... I went to a thingy and they decided to stay longer than I did. so my dad dropped me off
it okay (:
go have fun
bye
I can bike no problem. why haven't you started?
you can start regardless of me being there. don't let me hold you guys up
okay, I'll try and be there as soon as possible
will do. bye bye
sorry... 
whoa.. me too. sorry for everything?
I don't know.. I don't think so. well I mean.. it wasn't too good, so I guess yes?. sorry, I suppose I should let you get to sleep or something
It was really long and kinda boring.. and you weren't in it at all.. 
I think I miss you too
that's what I think about you :3. really easy to miss 
nah, that's silly. and is it because of the lack of snow?
Is it my fault?
ah, I feel like that too
yes, without snow it's just another break. that too. you probably wouldn't have time for Puss n' Boots
oh, so did you already watch it?
Oh, was that good?
neat (:
awesome :D
but I'm still guessing no time for Puss n' Boots then..
it is. if you'd like. it was probably my fault you missed practice.. sorry for keeping you up so late
haha, cute :3. I'm sorry that you have no room :/ 
and that you've had to sleep on the floor
I wish I could help. :(
it's okay. I like sleeping on couches.. but I guess that's not an option
yes (:
I wish I could be your pillow so you could sleep
well.. looks like I beat you to it, huh. I gotchu :3
ahh, you got me. *squish* . if I had the ability to let you sleep on me whenever you wanted.. I would
I'm usually always sleepy ^_^. I just.. choose not to sleep. because if I fell asleep and you woke up you'd just be laying there all like "What do I do now?"
aww :3. that sounds cute (:
You're cute
jinx :D. sorry :P
I'm just repaying my debt to society
haha :D. that was fun :3
I love you (:
sorry..
Egg nog :D
sorry, umm, I should probably let you get to sleep
even if it's on the floor. I haven't either o.o
I mean.. I used to get egg nog. and I would drink it
if it needs to be done, I will drink all the egg nog. I don't know.. nutmeg is a bit bitter
I don't know.. it kinda doesn't add anything
I guess the smell makes the taste of egg nog go away?
who knows :P
whoa, I've never had it heated up :P. whoa o.o
hmm.. sounds like we should have some (:. And I promise I'll at least finish it off. or I can get some so your mom doesn't feel so bad wasting it. anyway, you're probably really tired from being super cute all day.. I should let you get some sleep
I was too (:
let's do it :D
you too.. but sometimes you need to sleep.. because I guess it gets tiresome 
Like.. that's why puppies and kitties take naps all the time. because they need to recharge their cuteness . :D. I love you so so so soooo much too, Leandra :3. You're amazing
nah, I think it's just you
oh okay (:. You're soo perfect too :3
whoa.. I like pineapple
it's tasty :D. ahh spikes D:
that's nice of you (:
Anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams cutie pie :D. pies are sweet.. and so are you :D. sorry..
I just realized that :P
I think it's at the weight club
I mean, it's okay if you take a bite or two
just don't go too overboard
I think it's 10
I think so
or at least, I hope so
I love you too, see you tomorrow :D. You're so perfect, thank you so so so much
You can't imagine how lucky I am :3
I bet you are.. it's the only way things make sense :P
you're super cute :3
sorry.. but umm, goodnight and sweet dreams :D
Bye bye cutie pie 
say hello to the pineapple for me :D. bye :3

Did you miss me?. :P. sorry. oh it would be fun :D
I have taco shells . I mean.. no I don't know what that means :{. :P *. sorry. I suppose I should let you get to stuff... bye

whoa. crazy. well if you want to then it would be nice (:. and I can let you do stuffs in the meantime 
yes there is (:. well, whatever you want to do
well I want to do what you want to do. but I should let you do stuffs first (:
I don't know.. right now I think. but maybe 2 ish. when are you free?
whoa.... what would the ish be then?
I don't know.. rainy days are like.. sleep days n'.. board games and stuff like that. maybe we'll figure out what to do.. and I'll let you get to stuffs until 2:30. and I'll see you then?
where would you like to go>. ?*. /meet?
that would be cool ^_^
:D
good point. umm.. do you have a preference where we go?
I would have known about it :P. there's squires? if that's an okay place to go to... it's pretty far from your house though
I mean.. we don't have to do anything today
yes it is . I would like to do something.. but if you can't it's okay
oh well.. okay. ask then?. and then we'll see. sorry
if you can't it's okay.. it's probably just because of the weather
whoa. neat (:
that would be cool too (:. so.. squires then? at 2:30?. oh and there's Puss in Boots
okay (L. (: *
and then we can walk over?
yeah :D

I suppose and umm.. sorry again'. sigh. I missed a lot of talking to you during that time jump... I kind of regret it, but I think I'm going to have to go through another one, hopefully it'll be tomorrow by the time I return, but if it's days, don't worry about me.. I'll return somehow, I'm sorry for saying that stuffs ^ *point* but goodnight and sweet dreams

I'm sorry :/. have fun tomorrow and with your friend
you probably won't.. you have that song to write.. and you're mom said no already
it sounds like fun, but I won't get my hopes up
if you like
crying? :(. why?
There's no reason to be sad
you were sad before today?
It's probably my fault :(
I.. want to come see you now :(
that's the best time to see you (:
can I?. just.. really fast?
you're right :/
I.. may have.. rained a bit.. from my eyes. but.. I splashed my face with hot water.. so you wouldn't notice
nothing.. I'm sorry
it's fine.. 
no, it's really fine. you should go do your song
I'm.. okay
It's okay. you were sad before I was
well that's nice. but you should get to your homework. I wish I could help you more. sorry..
I wouldn't say that.. but thanks. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams. good luck with everything
nah, me being sad couldn't be. I'll see you Monday
oh and would you like a safety pin.. I had one that I was going to use  for that bottle cap, but you can use it if you need it. if you say so
I think I have one about the right size. I should be free tomorrow.. it's New Years Eve. everyone is out partyin'
nope.. not really. It means I'm free tomorrow
I miss you quite terribly. I guess it could be possible
it was fun, trust me (:
you can hold my hand whenever you want. but I'm not amazing
I was just about to say that too
oh no.. well bye bye then. cutie pie. go finish the lyrics. good luck. I love you :3
I'm glad
I'm sorry for earlier

I'm sorry for that "k word". but for whatever you think you do too
you don't have to be sorry
sure I do
uh uh
okay, bye bye. tag
n' poke
okay, goodnight 
that's legit, so no taking it back
okay, good luck, bye bye cutie pie
who else are you talking to?. because I think you sent that to the wrong person :P. I love you too (:. Tah tah for now
I'm still sorry for the "k thing". bye
goodmorning . I think I missed you, so I'm sorry
you're silly
you're silly and perfect :3
how's the song?
whoa.. sounds like you did a lot of work . and I'm not doing anything
haha, I'm not doing anything for New Years
I would, but the person I would like to do anything with can't do anything
but you're the one who can't do anything
really?
Because that sounds pretty amazing
like.. too good to be true. !!. Okay.. way too good to be true
caramel fountain?!?. like.. it spews sugary caramel?
I thought I had to get away. just kidding, I am excited!!. are you sure you want to have that kind of fun with a guy like me?
really?
you're right.. no one would. that sounds like so much fun though :3
aww.. who else are you inviting?aww.. if he's going then I'm not sure if I want tofacebook style won't open it. But it's okay
Really.... But it's really fine
haha. Of course on your computer. Thanks for the help.. but I've kinda lost hope 
Well that's the thing.... I'm not tired of you at all. I don't know why you'd think that either
:/. I'm not going to lie.. I feel the same way.. but in my point of view
You know? that you'd stop liking me
My parents are fine with me going over.. I'm more worried about your mom though.. I don't know.. I'm over a lot. And I hope you know that's pretty much why I'm sad.. . You know.. the thing that was said prior. sorry
To be honest they were expecting it. and sorry for what?
No like.. I told them about my paper. but.. then I found the email. and then I was going to rewrite it because it didn't work
I think my word is 2004
haha
No worries. a conversion thing popped up the second time I opened it up. Just didn't want to download it the first time. I don't know why. Which is good for you. That means you would have to waste your time with me
not really.  but you are
sorry
You know mine wasn't done because it was in the wrong format, right?. So.. you wouldn't have to waste your time with me
Yeah.. it would have been an easy fix if my paper actually saved. But since it didn't.. you know
Oh.. sorry. Alright.. the headers and the cites were in the wrong format
I would love to do homework
but I don't think it's really necessary. It's a great excuse to be with you though
.... Please don't get me started. There are a million reasons to want to be with you (:. Although.. I definitely couldn't put every reason to words. because sometimes somethings are more than words can say (:
nah
haha.. it's okay
What's so great about it?
but.. if I don't have any homework to do.. then you know...
sorry. Copy and paste?
No.. from what you sent me
... made?
Maybe
Yeah.. suppose you don't want to do anything now though
I suppose not. I suppose I always have that art project due tomorrow
I have to draw stuff
What do you want?
I wish I could help out there
I doubt that. I pretty much don't remember anything
I could :P
People only change when they're about to see someone. :P
I don't know.. I was just kidding
sorry
Well.. too bad I don't have homework. but thank you for your help
so much (:
You sent the paper to me. But I guess this means I can't do homework with you :/:/. :/ *
I could.. bring you that scone. if you wanted. (: ?. And.. I could.. doodle also?. sorry... I would probably be in the way
Ah.. well... good point. haha.. I could keep you awake until your homework was done :P. or not..
What is it about?
Sounds.. interesting. Also sounds like something I couldn't help with :/. Oh well. I should probably just let you get to that
It was alright. aside from them trying to drown me
Yeah.. that's so lucky
I don't know. But.. unfortunately I have nothing to do tonight. And I still can't find Doctor Who. Oh!.. darn. sorry.. \
haha.. lucky
Oh.. that's unfortunate. I wish I knew someone who wanted to watch it. Oh wait.. I know someone by the name of Peter. too bad you're busy. Because I think you'd think he'd be an average guy. :P
With a day like today? I'm surprised you haven't passed out yet
Alright, bye then
Maybe you should. haha, I'll just put off the homework I've got
Haha. Kinda. I just remembered about it. But I'm just going to avoid it
I have art to do. possibly some math. but it's whatever. :P. And.. I still can't find Doctor Who.. so it looks like I'm giving up. sorry.. I suppose I should go. I'm kinda curious as to what it is. was*. Umm.. goodnight, sweet dreams (the usual thing) and see you tomorrow 
I'm not.. it's just... I thought you were
I wish I could be used as for my warmth. But I'm actually kind of cold myself
Umm warm stuff?
(:
That's.. cute :D
sorry..
haha. I think you're cuter (:
Well.. I wish I could be there
If you were a hobo I'd give you a bunch of hugs to keep you warm. and.. money too. :D. Sorry
I was going to say "all my love". but I thought that'd be cliche
Yes.. I'm kinda freezing
I wish I wasn't either. And I wish I could be with you and be warm. but.. you know. sorry. And.. you're gone again. I suppose that means I should be gone again too. except not again.. because I never left. so.. goodnight for a second time. I<3u
I haven't a single plan, I'm completely free today.. but I wouldn't want to ruin any of your plans. Hello
alright. and I thought you were going to the pool. Well isn't that a bummer? For me at least.. then I wouldn't have had to walk home with that painting :P It wasn't so bad in the beginning.. but it was bothersome hopping over fences n' what not :P. Yeah.. pool :P Just forget about me and have fun
Oh.. hey. Aw.. well. no..
I would offer you a ride if I had one 
Well.. there's always tomorrow, right?
Just as good, eh?. Anyway.. . You should have fun today
Which one?. Okay?. I'll assume you're busy and just go
oh.. well. Like I said.. you should have fun today. And I'm the least fun person out there. I don't know why you'd invite me over
Well I'd love to. but I still feel like a bother
I'm not unavailable. I just don't know why you'd wanna spend time with me today. and.. it's really cold in my house...
well sounds like it could be fun
why not tomorrow?. and.. I'm lost. why is that sad?
frowny face
sorry
then why is today okay?
Oh, that makes perfect sense. I feel like I'd be in the way then if I came over. Because you'd get less time with them. plus.. I'm not all that great
Well.. umm. maybe. the whole "Usually free" thing was so that I could have a 'u' in the "you". But.. I tend to be free a lot, but over the summer I have to do a lot more working stuff
Well.. I gotcha. So.. if what I said made you less free than before.. then darn. sorry..
I would like to.... but I don't want to get in the way/be a bother. and.. even if I'm not exactly available over the summer.. well.. you know. maybe.... I don't know
No. I just may end up being busy. And then other times you could be busy. and you may end up feeling like you don't want to hang out at all
I would love to
especially with you. We live really close. You know.. if you feel like you're too busy I can always watch Doctor Who alone. (if I find it, which is doubtful). sorry...
Is that something you'd want to do?
That sounds awesome 
In my head that's how I pictured it. and I liked the idea then . so.. yes (:
You sure you want me over though?. And.. I wouldn't even know when :P
so like.. now?. If you want to see me then. I don't know.. seeing me isn't that great.. I feel like the less you see of me the better
Of course I want to
I just don't see why you would want me over
haha
Well.. I'll come over as soon as possible. (:. You're amazing
If I ring your doorbell will someone I don't know answer and scare me away?
But how will I know I'm safe even then?. And how will I get your attention?
oh.. well. okay. if you say so. and in that case. I'll see you soon (:
bye
:P
Hi. sorry if I'm bothering you :P
I messaged you.... you're absolutely no bother (:
I'm great, how are you?. doing* well. (fail)
That's great. (:
Umm.. What's up?
I'm just.. doing nothing :P. talking to you (:
I suppose. I hope you have fun with the movie thing
haha. either way it should be amazing (:
I can't wait for all the summer-y things :P
Same :D
There's an alright one at Virginia Tech . Near the outdoor track
Yeah, but it leads right to the road. Oh wait.. it would be that one. and one across the street
Yeah. Sounds like you want to go "ice-blocking"
Oh.. why would you need a hill?
Wouldn't that be difficult?
.... But. never mind. So.. are you not going ice-blocking.. but others are?
alright.. okay. well.. I'm just stupid
I would imagine. Well.. have fun. And have a great day
Haha, with what? :P. And nah.. I'm not
Or lackthereof
Just sit under a tree? Until something good comes to mind? great idea!! :D. Thank you. And I'm still not cool
Oh yeah!
I will totally make more (:. And I will save one just for you. If you want it. :P
Nah, there should be plenty :D
The only song that like.. ever plays is "Story of Us". :P
haha, alright. bye (:. Talk to you later if I'm lucky. *sigh*.. I've just had about the worst day I've ever had in a long time.. :/. I hope you have a nice day today (: Have fun at the pool (if you're still going)
Hello
Sorry for those phone calls n' what not
and why are you sorry?
I may have been trying to get a hold of you. but I suppose it's a little too late now
Oh, makes sense . :P. I'm sorry about that. I wish I could help you find it
Oh well.. sounds like a load of fun! :D I'll miss them even though I've only met them once, but they were pretty cool guys from what I gathered And it was.. just an off day, not much you could do about it :P
:3
haha
haha, rawr to you too (: You're up pretty early :P. Goodmorning. sorry
nah :P. How are you this fine morning?
I just woke up.. no joke :P. I like.. was having a "nightmare". So I jolted out of bed :P. So that's pretty much it 
Well I was with this one person and then they realized.. they wanted to kill me and there was this creepy doll there and I got cursed by some voodoo magic. It was.. creepy
Maybe it's a sign that we should :D. unless you don't want to
I'm assuming that's the second one
Well like.. I've only seen the first one. and the first one doesn't have a dog in it
Well maybe that was it. I don't know. it's been a while since I've seen it
I'm pretty sure I'd get scared even if I knew about it. I'd be like.. oh dear here it comes. here it comes!. and then scream. :P
haha. Well. Seems like it could be fun :D
I'm kinda excited
of course gummi bears!. I was going to suggest nothing because you'd be too scared to grab the food.. and if you did you could like.. throw it because of getting frightened
exactly. You know.. to hide the monster
Even more perfect because of you 
Nah.. I just ruin everything
I suppose it's just your opinion 
What is that anyway>. ?*
Never mind.. my sister likes that movie. it kind creeped me out. kinda*
Oh.. yeah, that movie was sad :'(. Well I've seen both :P. But I remember neither of them
It's Mr. Ramsey's birthday today
Do you have him added on facebook?
Oh yes :D
Oh well... Yeah.. it told me. So when I'm at school I'll be all like "Happy Birthday"
And he'll be all like "Where's my gift?"
I don't want to poison the man. especially not on his birthday
Of course
Yeah.. but these aren't as fresh as before :P
I doubt anyone would want one now
Yeah. anyway.. remember how you suggested me to run at like.. 8 am?. Well I'm thinking that it doesn't sound so bad :P
I said it didn't sound so bad. I'd prefer to stay and talk to you. unless you want me to leave. which I completely understand. sorry. I can go regardless. and stop bothering you
Oh... well alright. :/ same :P. I'll talk to you later then. and by "same" not the same run thingy. just.. running in general
I mean, I would like to... but I doubt that you'd have the time/want to see me in the first place
Yeah.. well I run "too fast" . and I'm all the way over here. so.. I suppose I'll talk to you later if you care to
Nah, I'm just too out of the way
I'd run over to you, but I don't think you'd want me around and I thought you just wanted to run alone. Anyway.. I'll let you get to it. and I'll just head over to the huckleberry :P
like.. 12. So I was going to run for an hour
Why not?
just another reason that I'm going to end up alone :P
Yeah.. so I guess goodbye. sorry. talk to you later if you want. sorry.. again
sigh :P. alright. buh bye
I would. But.. you know. I'm fine being alone
You're not that slow. It's seriously fine though. If you don't want to run with me I can run alone
If you want.. it's a public place
It's by the library
Yeah.. anyway.. I think I'll start now
Maybe :P. bye
Oh, thank you (: Good luck on.. stuff you do today :D
Would you really want to watch it with me? and wait.. did you actually run over to the huckleberry?
Well you missed me because I began running at 9:10 and ran for about 21 minutes
Well.. I waited until 10 to see if you would show up.. but I kinda hit my knee on the stair post before leaving.. and it started to hurt too much to continue for that hour
I would have most definitely have found you.. but whether I were able to run or not would have been a different story.. because my knee is killing me.. so waiting probably wouldn't have been worth it
He's someone who is in my friend group. but Drew, Gap, Andy, and Cody think it's funny to pose as him
Yes
You might. but I wouldn't know if you knew him or not. he's a junior. No, different knee.. and why would you say you would run if you weren't planning on it?
Just an old photo. I should probably.. go. Sorry that I missed you
It's not your fault that i got hurt. It was actually funny. ish
I opened my door and then turned around and rammed my knee as hard as I could into the post. not on purpose though. good times.. except not really
pretty much. I didn't mind it at first so I ran 2.5 miles on it. but once I stopped it started throbbing
And I was going to run more.. but I decided it hurt too much
Really?
It took me 9 minutes :P
sorry. What did you mess with?. The intersection is about .85 miles maybe
This is the one with the gazebo?
Right well.. yeah.. .85 miles
Oh.. well I always go straight. just for future reference, but not like you care
yeah. Well... I would have loved to have run with you or at the least have bumped into you. but seeing how it took you an hour to get there.. I would have had to run the entire way :P
sorry
I don't know. All the way to the gazebo?. maybe... I don't know... anyway, I should get ready for school n' what not
haha. exactly. :D. Anyway, I'll talk to you later if I get the chance. or if you want to. either way :P. bye
: sorry.. anyway, see you later if you want :P
H'lo again
Sorry. I can go.. if you want. I feel like I look silly in both of them.. whereas you look amazing (:
Well the "oh" just makes me think "Oh.. it's you"
Oh, sorry
Is there a single one where I didn't look silly?. Nah, never do I look awesome.. but I gotta say, you looked very pretty (:
Well thank you, being a penguin is pretty cool, much better than myself normally :P sorry.... Well you're just saying that
Aww.. why would you crop yourself out of it? You'd just ruin the entire photo. Nah. But I think you are (:. You're so amazing
Every single photo of you is amazing
But.. I don't look *as* silly in that one 
I think you are too
Yeah, I kinda like that one too
mostly because I'm purposefully being silly looking :P. instead of it being an accident :D
I was. Because you're so amazing. but I was still being silly on purpose :P
Well I don't.. it's just so silly :P. and I like.. you (:. sorry..
I have to wait on my brother, he's coming to pick me up. and... (:. sorry :p. but you're so amazing
Can I see it?
My hand isn't.. that big
ah.. gotcha
well.. now.. I'm a little self conscience about it.. :P
Are you sure you want to?
Don't worry, I won't leave you alone
haha, yeah.. cool beans
Thank you
Totally
haha. of course. any other way and I'd fail. :p. And.. this may be.. weird.. maybe?. But.. how late would those scary movies get to?
Well.. no exam tomorrow.. so my parents wouldn't mind how late
I just.. wouldn't know how late you'd let me stay
Okay, that sounds alright (:
Oh, that's fine
haha, awesome
Very scary :P. haha, well I can't wait. I'll talk to you later after my exam n' stuff. But as for now.. I should go. Bye (:
thanks again. And see you later
sorry :P so.. I don't know if you still want to do anything.. and I don't know why you'd want to in the first place.. but.. hi :P. Hola
How are you?
I'm okay.. and the exam was pretty easy
We were told it was going to be easy. so I'd say it was. And I didn't exactly mean the SAT was easy. it just wasn't too bad
Nope
There's always other things that could be done before though.. maybe?. I don't know. But yeah.. it's still bright 
haha. Both sound very fun. but I wouldn't want to ruin your day so early :P
Well I'd love to be able to do that.. . but I don't think I can
after that I can ruin it?
oh. still.. don't think I can. I mean.. it's me
That's silly
Pretty much. I'm just silly
Nah, the worst silly
.... hmm. well.. I'm nothing good, so.. there has to be bad silly :P
can't believe wiki
no. never
nah. I still don't believe it
well it's not
Nope
sure it is... :P
You are magic. and I'm free from now to whenever after that. yeah.. :P. but have fun n' stuff :D
Oh, take as long as you want
I don't exactly.. but I read them
Did yours say something "special" today?
Meddle with what?. :P
Well.. just don't meddle then :D
I'm not, but you are. talk to you later then 
haha.... okay, bye . :D
haha, of course. I gotta go grab my cat, it's outside, I hope I don't get rained on :P. or if he gets rained on. that would be much worse. so.. brb
haha.. yeah. he's hiding in a bush.  but you were saying?
yeah, it's great :D. My ride, however.. just left . but no worries.. if you still want me there I can find a way. I'll take that silence as a "I don't want you over here anymore". yeah.. either way I gotta brb. again. back.. but I see you aren't
I will brave the storm
It's fine.. I'm already wet. I had to find my cat. So.. I will brave it and see you if you want
I wouldn't want to impose. so.. don't worry about that. and.. I have 2 cats.. so.. looks like I'm going to have to brb again
Alright.. I assume he took shelter and is under the shed. But I'm sort of soaked now.. 
so I understand if you know.. .. :P. I exaggerated on the "soaked" thing. but I'm still wet :P
It's fine, you don't have to. "Braving a storm" is on my bucket list
You wouldn't have to do that either. And I'm planning on an umbrella :P
I mean, no sense in both of us getting rained on eh?
Haha, if you insist. That would be.. not alright. but better
aw.. fine. well.. actually. Shouldn't implies that it's something dumb.. but it doesn't say that I can't. :P. sorry. so.. that's a no then?
aw.. yeah. I suppose. I think I hear it calming down
I could.. walk in this?
I'd rather get electrocuted
Please?
I suppose we could. But not any time soon I don't think
I'd.. really like to. if you'd let me
dumb?. not safe?. Dangerous?. stupid?
irresponsible?. It's all of those words
It could be.. a little dangerous :P
Well.. I would gladdly walk out of this house
Alright... then it's settled.. haha. I'll see you soon
Just.. leave out the "he's walking over here" part
I'll try not to
just.. close your eyes.. and don't think about it
wait for a doorbell. and don't blame yourself, it's not your fault so don't feel bad about it
So?. I'm choosing to do this
Hold on. :D!!!!!. My brother will give me a ride when he gets here
He'll be here in about 7 minutes. so like.. just have to wait that little bit (:
haha, awesome 
Well, that's okay. are they sour twizzlers?. or like.. do you not like sour stuff :P. ?. OH!!. Twizzlers and Mr. Pibb. I heard that's amazing. :P. sorry
So you don't like sour stuff
You can substitute mr. Pibb with anything
ah, well. I gotcah. gotcha*. it's fine
Oh well it doesn't matter. Normal twizzlers are great :D
So you were talking about feeling bad n' stuff and how it was a dumb idea.. so while we were having this conversation I called my brother.. and yeah (:. Sorry :P
I'm glad that he was coming home
exciting :P. He's here. see you soon (:. bye. If you still want me there of course
:D. alright. see ya
Whoa, hey
It's fine, I like being with you too (:. And I wanted to tell you why I like you so much. but I had to go
I'm not sure if it'd mean as much over facebook. but I'd really like to tell you
Does what have to do with the soggy twizzler?
Not really
haha. it's fine
I should have tried some
haha. I know the feeling well. :P
yup :P
haha. I tried it with honey. but i used too much
No, but a lot of honey :P
It was.. overwhelmingly sweet
yes
haha, it's fine. this is stuff I need to know :D
Sorry for talking to you. I feel like you may want to go to sleep. and.. I'm not out of your league
...
The only way I'm out of your league is if I were on the lower end
There's no way 
No, you're perfect
Well.. I'd explain myself.. but I feel like it loses meaning on facebook. But.. I would. and it may take a while
especially since you'll just keep reminding me of new things
Yes (:. You're so perfect. Why you talk to me comes as a surprise
the "seemingly" just makes it "seem" perfect. but it really isn't :P
Oh, she has
nah
or she does . nah. no way
well.. still, I'm not out of your league. You've already got me
I don't 
Well.. you are just you. which is the most I could ever ask of you. Because you are the bestest. But to be honest I feel bad that you feel bad. you know?
I don't think I'm helping
I love you too . And I love you for who you are and everything about you. sorry.. I'm just.. cliche. and lame
I like how you were original :D
We probably should. and you're so much cooler. And I'm sorry about things
Me too, but about you (:. sorry... I was going to say "really?". but.. yeah, sorry. I just.. it is weird
but like.. not a bad weird
sorry, you were typing?
I can't either, you make me happy (:. whether you know it or not. I kinda feel bad that you feel guilty at times though... sorry
It's just.. I don't want you to feel bad or anything. But I have similar thoughts too. so I kinda know how you feel
I feel the same way about you
well thing implies that I'm above tv on the special scale :P. sorry
I wouldn't mind at all
I just woudn't want you to feel bad about anything
and not above food of course :P
Wanted you to what?
haha. It'd be nice. I just don't want you doing anything you don't want to
Well I just.. I didn't know because you kept pulling away. I just assumed you wanted me as far away as possible
It's fine
haha, thank you
I kinda felt cold though
Like.. when I wasn't hugging you of course
and.. possibly
I was warmer hugging the pillow though
It wasn't the same though :P
haha, thank you. I didn't think you wanted any hugs.. so when you snuck a few I was very surprised and.. well happy too . but I wouldn't want you to change or anything.. like just because I say that. sorry
And butterflies?. And a racing heart?. maybe?... . I don't know.. that may just be me
(:. I like the first one
oh wait?. sorry. Umm.. yeah... I love you (:. I'm sorry. I suppose I should let you get to sleep. I'm so sorry. ... goodnight and sweet dreams (:. Yea.. I guess I'll just go
I figured. But that's okay (:. Right.. well I hope you have a good day n' all that. :D. I don't know if the storm warning applies to downtown.. but I hope it doesn't interfere with those festivities you were going to. Good morning (:
sorry. how are you?
I'm good, and why would you have wanted that?
Oh, gotcha. Sounds like.. overachievement :P. sorry. just kidding 
haha, nah, it's cool to want to get stuff done. It allows for other things later :P. Right well.. I should probably stop bothering you n' all
I knew it :P. sorry. Well.. yeah, can't wait :P. Have fun with yours.. . even though it's a lot later
Wait.. is yours at 12:40?
Oh, gotcha. sorry. I'll just.. go die in a hole or something
that's cool. I do that sometimes too. anyways.. I gotta go find that hole. have a nice day and stuff
sigh.. haha, thanks
I told you.. that I would go die in a hole. so thanks for the good luck. I suppose I'll go do that now
Well.. I just feel like I'm annoying you, so I feel like I'd do us both a favor. so.. sorry for stuff
I don't know what you'd be sorry for
but have fun with that
Sounds like fun. But you don't have to be sorry for that. that's more important
yeah...
sorry
Alright, have fun with that. and have a fun day
I am.. 
Yeah... and I'm free afterwards
But you're pretty busy.. so
        Well.. technically
I'd have to get appropriate clothing on
And by that.. I'd have to get out of my pjs
Yeah :P
haha, why?
That's silly
aw?
Well it is. but with me?. That's just silly. sorry.. I'm keeping you away from your toast
        I don't see why
could've fooled me. sorry. Anyway.. I can go if you want
I wouldn't want to ruin your day
Well, it's silly to want to see me :/
sorry. I just feel in the way. and that you could have more fun with other people
not your fault
I'd like to too. I'm just lame though
That's why you use grape jam ;P. :P *
Exactly. That's why cooler than me
right well.. I still feel like a bother. especially yesterday
I'm sorry. but like.. . I don't know.                     sorry
the space was by accident. sorry
It's whatever. I'll just let you get to your toast. and let you have fun
         nah
I really don't know what is up with the spaces
Yeah. Well you have things to get to. so.. I'll quit wasting your time
When did that happen?. :P
I think they're at the hospital
And if you don't have time today, that's fine.. just enjoy the thingy downtown. sorry.. umm.. the Montgomery Hospital. I'm not positive. sorry
            haha, that's unlikely. :P I'd really like to see you later.. but I still feel like I'm not worth your time.    But.. I'll just go
Not in my perspective
yes. because I'm pretty much worthless. sorry, I keep.. getting in the way
haha, yesh (:. I'm sorry. It's just....                   never mind :P
I still should let you go get stuffs done
Umm.. I don't know. anyway.. bye
bye cooler person. (and thanks for.. not digging deeper :P). sorry. I'm lame.. bye
Possibly. but it's nothing important.. like me :P
I don't know.. I feel like it's just lame.. so I feel like you'd think I'm lame for thinking it
Well.. you said "I like your you" and you hugged that other guy. so.. you know.. lame reason
I suppose it was him
Well, I'm sorry
well, it's whatever I suppose
Don't be sorry. It's fine. I just.. thought too much of it
well I really liked being with you
But because of what I said before.. I may have felt like I shouldn't have been there
The stuff before?. About you hugging him
It's fine
Well it's okay. It just made me a little jealous and made me feel out of place. it's really whatever
Don't be
It's fine. Yeah, but if you don't get the chance I'll try and stay away from any holes. or buckets :P.    just kidding. :P. sorry\
  I'll be sure of that. Bye. see you.. if I see you :P. have fun an' stuff (:
I'll be getting a physical :P. you know.. a little less fun
Bye Leandra. (: (:. sorry for double smiles 
haha, nah. bye for now
I hope your day was good n' stuff Goodnight and sweet dreams (:
Hey. Didn't expect you to go online. (:
in that case I'm sorry
My day was boring. how was yours?
I know. it was crazy :P
I didn't do anything today, that's why
Anything with you would be amazing. (:. I'd really really like to
Well you should go ahead and eat them. I feel like they mean more to you :P. And.. I'm really bad at sewing :/. sorry
Oh no.. it's super bad. and it's not done yet. I feel like.. all the threading has given me a gnarly headache :P
sorry . But they have machines for stuff like that
I mean.. they still have to thread the bobbin.. but you know
I'm already so close to being done
haha, almost
pretty much :P. I haven't tasted it though. so I'm just guessing 
Right, well.. I should probably stop bothering you. and let you get some sleep
Climbing up the side of a waterfall and sleep deprivation go hand and hand
What's even better is the swimming hole.. which I could like.. drown in. :P
Yeah.. it's not worth the trip to find that swimming hole.. but I suppose drowning is fine. oh, and skipping rocks. that's a lot of fun too. but drowning takes the cake
Same here. So yeah.. if I never see you again. it's because I fell off the side of that waterfall. or I drowned. it's either of those. Or a bear.. . I saw one of those up there, it could maul me. one false step and I may not make it home
Don't want to lose the hat. and I don't have bear mace. so I'm stuck flirting with disaster . But who cares anyway?
The last time I went I almost slipped off a rock ledge. Which would have resulted in a lot of pain :P. And thanks for that
If I die.. I'll remember you for that
Mine actually says "Don't attempt anything too dangerous today. Today is not a favorable for hiking or any other activities relating.". And by today.. it means tomorrow :P
Then don't
I didn't copy and paste. just giving a synopsis . But oh well. we'll never know. Just remember Murphy's Law 
I'm sorry, I'm just being a downer
I don't know where that is. But it sounds adventurous . Especially because of the word "Dragon"
I'm terrified of heights. but.. I'm wiling to try it. willing*
Well.. I'm okay with heights that I know I won't die if I fall. other than that.. scary stuff
oh, just remembered.. I never got to tell you that thing.. which you may have forgotten by now.. looks like it may take a while, because you're probably busy and I should stop bothering you. but that's good. anyway.. I suppose I should just say goodnight again :P
Just wanted to see me for that? . It could be disappointing
That's silly.. I don't know why
Yeah, you too. And maybe I do.. maybe I don't :P. anyway.. sweet dreams. Totoro is.. super cute. by the way. sorry.. random
I didn't
I just.. found out about him today
Have you already seen it?
What is that?
Well.. sounds awesome :D
That would be super sweet. I kinda wish I had a totoro plushie.. I saw one in Toy Story 3. but I didn't know that's what he was called
Yeah, he looks really cool :D. huggable too :P
sorry. anyway.. I rethought what I was going to type and i'll just leave it at goodnight
Just something lame.. kinda like me. which is what I was going to say within itself but.. not really
Well it's lame. either way
I'm not, but you are :D
I can sleep on the way there
I kinda hope we see a bear again. Wasn't able to take a photo the last time
It was so fast
it was crazy
It just made a bunch of thud sounds
That's how it happened with me :P
anyway.. I love you---kuleles . sorry. I'll leave on that note. that was bad... I'm kinda really sorry
Well ukuleles are pretty cool... But you're way more special (:. sorry.. you've probably had enough of me. so.. goodnight. sweet dreams and bye
Have fun tomorrow
yeah, bye for now. eh.. . yeah, sorry
Oh.. just.. nothing important. Wanted to ask something. but I think that something can wait
Well.. you know.. Monday
I was wondering if you'd be available then. if you're not, I completely understand. sorry. I don't need an answer, I can just go
I don't know.. those movies sounded like fun.. but I honestly didn't think you would have wanted to
4th one for ps2. :P. And that sounds like it'd be a lot of fun
Yes, of course
Yeah, you too
sweet dreams and all that
yeah, see ya. :D
And.. dreams of.. special stuff that's special to you :P. (which I can't think of). soryr
sorry*. bye
Before I left I just wanted to say have a great day with whatever you do :D
Sorry. I doubt you're still there. But if I were lucky and you were still there, I'd like to tell you about it :P
Hello (:
Yay for what?
That's silly. but I wasn't certain if I would have either. I was making something.. and then remembered facebook was up. sorry for the boring explanation, but how are you?
Who said it was sewing?. :P. I'm pretty good. I'm also pretty tired :P. Hiking was killer 
Wish you could have hiked with me. but I saw some alright stuff, nothing I haven't seen before. I did fall a lot. and slip. I'm surprised I'm not completely broken. slipped*
No bears this time
I was wearing shorts
A lot of thorns. Like I said.. I'm surprised I came out alive
The cascades?. Dragon Tooth. I don't know :P. Dragon's Tooth*
Where's the Quarry?. I didn't even know.. like there was one :P
I was pretty much out in the middle of nowhere. There was a bee's nest that I almost stepped in
And I almost fell off the entire side of the waterfall
Of course.. because me dying is something you'd like isn't it :P
I took some.. not a lot because I already took some last year. It was scary though, it rained on us and we had to climb down a slippery slo[e. slope*. And I would like to see those photos :D
Wouldn't you want to do something better with your Monday?. And bikes are nice :D
That's a good day for you? that's silly. and the bike?.. is pretty snazzy :D. Mine is a piece of junk :P
Well.. I would love to do something with you. if you wanted
Well, it'd be really really awesome. If you're able to of course
Well, I'd like to do anything as long as it means spending time with you. I kinda liked what you said before. but I'm open for whatever :D
inappropriate frisbeeing?
I'm.. scared. but okay. That entire list seems amazing. haha :P
Sounds like we could do it all in one night! o.O
:P
haha! :D
That's amazing
I doubt I have that much. Totally.. and I could even chip in :D
haha. yeah. It's like.. karma
yeah :P. I'm.. sore :P
Oh, I just fell a bunch. I'll get over it :P
It rained.. and I'm walking along a river. except.. not walking exactly
yeah
well, no
climbing
No worries.. the worst that could have happened was a sprained wrist. and it doesn't feel *so* bad :P. but yeah.. I should probably stop boring you with how my day was :P
bunny?
Did.. you.. kill it?
Oh. that's cute :D
Awesome. I've never been that close to a bunny :P
Anyway, I should let you get to that. and yes, really. and I should probably go and be less of a bother
I'll go do it right now
Such a random smiley :O. :P *. sorry. I'm being boring
that it does
I think I can guess what brought that up. anyway.. I should stop bothering you and let you get some sleep or something
umm.. I don't know, I could be wrong. and like I said before. I should stop bothering you
I saw that Twe was online and I know she was in that one class. so that was my guess
and I don't think I will catch on to that
I always feel in the way
Well.. I don't know. It would have been better if I just stayed up on that mountain today
Umm.. no. I meant up on the mountain where I was hiking. where the bears are
Oh well I meant.. like.. just staying there.. you know. not coming down. leaving everyone alone
nah... it would do everyone else a favor
Good point
 Well.. I feel like.. maybe I should still disappear. for a while maybe. Because I do think poorly of myself. and I don't know why. but in my head it's all true :P
I don't know why. I'm nothing special. Anyway.. I should probably go.. and hate on myself for a little bit
Well it means the most from you. but I feel like I'm just a waste of time
not really
Just suppose that's the way I feel towards myself. Like.. no ones corrected me so I kinda just go with it
Right, well I know what you're saying
and it's completely true
I honestly don't know what to like
I feel like I could be a better person.. and I dislike that about myself. that I'm not that better person. I also make things hard on you.. by complaining and by being a loser. I don't know why you'd want me around because of that
Oh, I'm not really sad. I'm just upset with myself
I'm also really bad at sewing 
Well.. not really for no reason
not really a god reason. good*. To be honest.. it's mostly because I don't feel good enough
and no matter how I try I never feel like I am
It could be possible. I don't know how. I just feel like you could do better
I don't think that would help. because I've taken the risks. I still don't feel good enough. it's mostly because I feel like you could always do better.. and that the other guys you talk to could make you even happier. Not that I do in the first place
You're not the problem. I just over think about things
maybe?. I don't know. It's weird.. I don't feel sad. I just.. I'm just sort of confused
No, I shouldn't, because you make me extremely happy
So like.. I don't feel sad but I don't feel special either :P
I.. needed to hear this song a long time ago, haha. and I like you too. Oh my goodness "I'll break my heart more than you'll ever do"
That song.. speaks so well. Thank you
I still don't feel set apart.. but the song is pretty much how I feel
 haha. well, thank you. Still there's too many scenarios to analyze :P. And I'm not exactly him
... alright. well... I don't think I'll ever explain myself that well. but thank you for trying to help :D
sigh, yeah. :/ . :P. haha. Well, I should probably let you get to sleep or something
It's really nice
I'm sorry. Like I said.. feeling set apart and special just isn't happening. and I suppose I should be fine with it and get over it. and I will, just give me time
umm yeah.. that. :P
well.. I was hoping you didn't notice. but pretty much I feel like.. well.. I feel like pretty much every other guy that you know
It's whatever
possibly. but that was very reassuring. it's my fault for over thinking and breaking my heart :P
I know that you have it. but I feel like I'm breaking it anyway
not you're fault. it's no biggie
yeah.. pretty much :P
You still want to?. sorry. alright, I'll see you. if you're able to of course :P. goodnight and sweet dreams
It's cool if you're not. Eventually I'll just fade away anyway, eh? ;P. night
haha, if you say so
Goodnight, Leandra
I was tempted to say "G'night luv". in response.. you know, sound British as well. but I didn't :P. sorry, sweet dreams. (:. sorry, another one of those scenarios is playing in my head :/. but I'll just go regardless
Sorry about last night, I didn't want to waste any more of your time Anyway, I hope you have a great day
okay then. Will do. And have fun with that, I hear spiders like to hide up there :P
Aw.. just missed me :P. And sorry. but it's true. last time I was cleaning gutters I caught a brown recluse spider :P. and I just missed you too :P. sorry
Yeah, I caught one. that was before I knew how deadly they were though
It was probably last year :P. I don't deal with spiders all that much. so I just thought it looked like I needed to catch it. :D
I luckily didn't have a ladder
No, the roof was flat enough so that if I could climb up onto it I could clean the gutters from there
Well.. are you done already?
well, don't let me be in the way
Is the bike worth it? haha
I wouldn't know. unfortunately. 100 ish
ish because it could be more or less. probably more :P. it's just my guess
haha, I mean.. it's probably more up at $150. Unless you buy it used :P. But I just checked out a bike that's like.. $120 :P. so who knows
And it'd look pretty sweet :P
That's pretty neat. I should probably let you get to work or something. and if you care, I am free today 
 :P
Well.. nothing has really happened. but I did get to talk to you. so I'd say it's been pretty awesome :D
haha. And that just makes your day spectacular, eh?. I wouldn't want to ruin it from that :P
Better than what toast could do?. I doubt that. I mean.. it's *toast*. And I'm just me :P
And?. haha. sorry. As if I'm more special than toast :P
It's very hard to believe. Because toast is like.. normal bread. which is fantastic. but like.. it's toasted. and buttered. which is crazy amazing :D
Nah. Like I said, it's very hard to believe. :P
It's opinion
I'm not doing a very good job at letting you get that stuffs done
I don't think so
if you're supposed to be cleaning gutters.. and you're on facebook then you aren't being very productive. Wouldn't you say the sooner you got those gutters cleaned the sooner we could possibly hang out?
haha, awesome. I'll talk to you later then. Have fun :D
I mean.. as much fun as you can have I suppose. Which may not be a lot :P
in that case
for cleaning gutters? you should be :D
alright talk to you then :P
awesome :D. ish :P. sorry, you're probably working again :p
gotcha. Sounds like a lot. wouldn't need any help would you?. sorry :P
are you going to come back every third?
haha, well it's all fine by me
not really
nope. but.. funny you should mention that :. :P *
I really wish that I wasn't so bad at drawing :/
no, my wish didn't come true. because I just messed up on something. and it would be impossible to start over. but I suppose I'll live. it wasn't life threatening . anyways.. I should probably let you get back to the gutters
no.. not at all :P. and that's really awesome :D. hold on I gotta go cut myself. some fabric*. sorry... that sounded really bad. but I have to cut some fabric. as you do actual work, which makes me feel kinda lazy :P
alright, I'll talk to you later when you get back. :D
Awesome :D. Hi
How are you?. sorry
I'm alright
Oh well.. about that. I kinda already promised that I'd do something with someone else. You may know her.. her names Leandra . you know :P. So I should honor that, you know?
I mean.. I suppose it wouldn't be too weird. but to be honest I'm not sure of the plans :P
I really don't know.. I'm up for anything. I just haven't heard from her in a while. She's been pretty busy
Well I suppose
She mentioned video games and old Japanese cartoons. So if she's not available, would you like to do those things with me?
Sounds like that guy likes you a lot. and I do like those. Haven't had much to really know though :P
You seem like you may want them more, but I'd be willing to try them out
Well sounds like a lot of fun. If you'd really want to of course
well, just let me know when I should drop by
Probably for those sour patch kids. :D
Right, I should go grab that. It may be a bit unfair playing it though :P
it's very similar to the 3rd one. But yeah, just let me know when you'd like to see me
alright, have fun with that :D
I kind of did.. but not really.    Like.. I ate lunch late :P
Like I've said before, I'll eat anything. Even raw tomatoes, I just won't prefer it :P
Oh, I thought something really bad happened when you said that. I kinda got worried :P
I mean.. I thought you were going to say "aw :( my mom said no"
Which I suppose isn't *really bad*. but you know. :P
it's fine. But those tomatoes should be happy because I wouldn't be killing them :P
Or live. you know.. I think they'd like that :D. But.. a nice deli sandwich sounds really good :D
:D. anyway.. should I let you do what you said you would?
very hopefully :P. bye. If not, talk to you later
Of course. It is a bit late, but that doesn't really matter :D
okay, that is if you still want to see me :P
Well, awesome. I'll see you soon then (:
bye. sorry for everything and for saying this again.. but goodnight and sweet dreams (: I hope you have a fantastic day tomorrow
Totoro was awesome :D thanks for letting me see it. Oh, and you make me super happy n' stuff :D. Hi (:. sorry.. if you're not there/busy
Oh, sorry :P
I know, so awesome :D. but if you can't talk to me, that's alright
no plans for me :P. but I shouldn't keep you from breakfast :P
http://www.yesasia.com/global/1003882921-0-0-0-en/info.html. Plus.. talking to me.. not so great :P. I mean, I talk to myself all the time
thanks
same here
and?
kidding still hurts 
doesn't help, just go eat your cold toast
sure you tried
Doubtful. But it's fine.. just shatter it all. it's not like it was that special :P
nothing. It doesn't matter.. I'm just being melodramatic :P
still.... :P. Your toast is getting cold
nah, it just gets burnt after that
Alright, see ya. You're awesome (:
so it still got burnt
well that's all that really matters
I'm okay I suppose. you?
If you say so. I thought so too, but I wouldn't know why you felt that way :P
the second part of that statement makes it understandable. :P
well there are cheats for that :P. otherwise you'd have to play through all the levels. and that can't be fun. I mean, it can. but it could get boring :P
I mean.. it's single player :P
I could always let you borrow it though
And since it's single player.. you wouldn't need me around. and yeah, that part too
Really?. I felt like running/biking. but I don't have anyone to go with
I don't see why it doesn't still apply
really awesome?
You're asking a guy.... so I wouldn't know
We play video games, shoot stuff, and watch tv. and eat
which is probably similar to what girls do :P
No, it's actually a bit colder than it has been for the past few days
I mean, it's not cold. But it's like.. in the 60's I think
Yes. It could have warmed up though
I just know it was colder earlier.. when I was at school
Yes. but with Mrs. Showalter
Other Mrs. Showalter. I'm not in Spanish
Yeah, Ksho. :P
Nah.. it's just her shorter name so that people don't get confused with her and the other Mrs. Showalter
Remember that aluminum thing I was carrying around?
No... I was just there finishing it 
Yes, so now I have about 6 or so shirts with that design on it. them*
I plan on wearing one of them. and there were several people who wanted one
so depending if they want it to glow in the dark or be regular there's a choice :P
yes
yes :D
I have not. They've just been sitting in a bag
I'll try it out when it's night time
I can manage
haha, thanks. yeah.. well. I wouldn't want to bother you any longer. so I may just.. head out on my bike, or run. who knows
Yeah, I think I may just run. because riding on the road is kinda scary. but I'll just leave you to whatever you're doing. which is probably way more important than talking to me anyway
I ride to it first
summer activities are still probably more important
Well I'd love to help, but I feel like I'd only get in the way
sorry, it's probably bad to feel this way. :?. :/*
I'm fine. like it just happened. I hate myself. sorry. I suppose I'll just.. save you the trouble and go
nothing. I'm panning out situations in my head . And they all have bad outcomes. I'm trying to fill a void of uncertainty and without clarity I just feel worthless
haha, that sounds like a great solution to the problem. and I would love to. I just.. wouldn't exactly know if I would be able to/I don't see why you'd want me over
Well.. I can always check
persuasion is going to be the most difficult task. but I'll be right back
Looks like I'll stay down in the dumps. thanks for the thought though. sigh . Well.. I can see that it doesn't even matter, because you're gone. So I'll just go too and be less of a bother
I wish it wasn't. because I kinda really wanted to
Maybe. This Friday is a lock in at my church though.. . So unless that sounded appealing to you. then nothing this week or the next
They told us to invite friends.,
but I understand if you didn't want to. You just wouldn't be able to see me for 2 weeks. which I suppose wouldn't be too bad for you
The exact address for my church is unclear to me :P. but it's on Mount Tabor Rd.. 1543 Mount Tabor Rd. 
Why would you want to call me?
we're talking now aren't we?
Well I'm not exactly in a good position right now. Not near a phone. And although I can't go over... I can go on a run. But that's probably not that appealing
Do you have a bike on hand at this very moment?
Didn't think so
Yeah, so running is pretty much the only option. but you don't have to tag along
Yeah, well. okay
It's fine. I just.. . you know what? It's whatever
It's nothing
Running alone is fine. Well to be honest it was the best way to get my dad to allow me to do something
Mine wasn't either. but that's purely because I had hoped to see someone
It's fine. and you don't have to "run" with me today either
I wouldn't want to make you do it
running is optional. I mean.. I just ate lunch and chugged 2 cups of milk
but seriously.. although I'd like to see you.. you don't have to "run" with me
I'd be excited if I didn't have to run with me either. But I'm left with no choice
Really?. Practice started at 3. Plus sometimes I run at 8-9pm
I wasn't here in the morning. I was stuck at school
Yeah. but.. still. I am fine running alone
How are you getting there?
Well I can always meet you downtown and we can go there. I suppose it doesn't matter where I run. or "run"
It wouldn't be a problem. but if you insist . I can always meet you there
awesome
Just a little bit of happiness. :P
true. but still. it applies. makes your day just a whole lot better, eh?
Yeah. I doubt there's anything else that could make you quite as happy
Like what?
well... okay then
not that. just.. I don't know. still in that "down in the dumps" mindset as earlier. so.. everything is pretty much negative
who knows?. Maybe it will
there's still the possibility that it won't though. Oh and... the huckleberry is kind of out of the way, don't you think?. I wouldn't want you to waste your time
You really don't have to just for me
you really don't have to
If you say so.. I guess I'll see you soon then
bye
sorry.. but.. did you send that while I was at your house?. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams (: (I may say that a lot :P.. but still I hope they're the bestest filled with the bestest because you are the bestest :D). :P. sorry
psst.. I hope you have a great day (:. How is what pronounced?
Did I write "evenught" because I don't see it :P And I have to do "working stuff" soon.. and if it does rain then I won't be able to run :/. but.. bye (:. See you maybe if I see you :P
Yeah, I hope your day was fantastic :D. Oh and.. still don't have gloves, but I was only raking :P. sorry for the double message and sorry for.. you know :P
Sorry, I was home. :/
Haha, alright. Goodnight and sweet dreams. sorry for keeping you up so late :P. And I didn't even notice the marshmallow
I think they've made a like about that :P
"that awkward moment when you just had an entire conversation with someone then realizing you had something on your face the entire time.". :P. anyway.. sorry for keeping you up so late. I will go so you can get some sleep (:
(I felt like I did something earlier that made you like.. I don't know). and sorry for what?. You're amazing (:
I don't know.. you kept "hiding" per se  . and no need to say sorry for tackling me
you're way cooler (:. I don't know, before we got in the car. It doesn't really matter. I just felt like I did something wrong or something :P
Don't be sorry. You just seemed to be laughing :P. I wasn't quite sure what was funny :P
Not "stupidly". You're amazing. and it was cute. I was just curious :P
haha, it's fine. I suppose it's nice (:. so thank you (:. sorry for scaring you :/
Well I won't any more. So no worries 
I'll at least try not to. Anyway, you're perfect (:. and I should probably just let you doze off. so... goodnight and sweet caramel dreams (:
I really really like you too, Leandra :D
I don't think I could beat that
I really wish I wasn't going to sleep in.. but I think I am going to :P. Just by being where?. in the dream? haha :P
Nah, I've kept you up late :P. I stayed up on my own :D
It sounds good
I wish I could know myself :P. O well :P
I have burns on my fingers.. not that it's important or relative in any way. haha. I meant by.. I wish I could know that the pizza was good myself
You should. but that's okay. :D
And it's fine.. they stopped hurting a while ago :P
You're even more awesome
I like you too (:. You're so perfect and I can't believe it sometimes
Of course (:. If you want to be of course
Am I yours?. I mean.. I'm not much
(:. I really want to be
did you watch it?
http://www.mwctoys.com/REVIEW_111006a.htm
I like hugging you too. It's warm :P. sorry
That's pumpkin head
That's before :P. what I sent was after :P. But on my look for that picture I came across a movie called Trick 'r Treat. which looks kinda cool :P. Comedy Horror :P. sorry. Have I put you to sleep yet?
I'm sorry . but the movie seems cool. I think I may just have to find it one day :D. n' watch it :P
totally D. :D *. Anyway.. I should probably let you get some sleep
I still like you too. I don't think it's changed
I heard it too :D. Yeah :P
I like you this way, so it's fine by me if you don't change. (:
oh, sorry
Well.. me either . (:
That's what I've been trying to say :P
It's okay 
And you're still cooler. :D. G'night
nah, you're the bestest and perfect. but I suppose we could argue that for a while :P. see ya (maybe on a run?) :P. maybe not :P. goodnight, Leandra
That's amazing. because I love you when you're happy (:. In fact.. I don't think I've seen you sad. sorry. yeah, goodnight (:. sweet dreams. So sorry. sigh :P good morning (:
Just sighed because it was morning :P. sorry. I'd say hi but I doubt you're still there :P. regardless, I hope you have a wonderful day (:
Yeah, not important stuffs though, so it's all good :P. This may be a silly question to ask but.. does the forecast call for rain?. Sorry.. I'm probably being bothersome. I can go :P. yup thunderstorms :P
well thank you (:. running probably sounds really silly right about now.. but I haven't done that in weeks. :P
Yeah. my brother is working.. so no one to run with.. but I suppose it's the thought that counts :D
I suppose :P
Well real running too :P
I.. don't
but Ive done it before
Mostly because it's cold
Umm.. how has your day been so far/. ?*
:/
I wish I could have slept for that long. I had to wake up early and help my brother work
I wish I could have slept just a little longer I suppose. I was in the middle of a really good dream
Same. but I liked it I suppose :P
yeah
It was weird. I was just at this party. and that's kinda all I remember
but at the time it was cool
alright, I'll probably go running. so have fun and everything
I wish you could too
Yeah, have a great day and such
Alright, never mind that :P. Yeah, you too
nothing important.. plus I don't want to waste anymore of your time
It's just bad. and you left me curious for a good bit of the day yesterday :P
Wait.. day before yesterday :P
It's cool
It's not important I was just going to state the obvious
Right well.. just the usual. I wish I could see you later n' stuff. but more than likely it won't happen
so I don't think that changed your day
and I think it'll only be a wish.. because I think you'll be busy :P. Me? Tired of you? nonesense. could only be the other way around. nonsense*
Nah, I'm lame :P. and growing tired of me could be way too easy
I think I may make my cheesecake first :P. and that would be fun. I really really like you (: and I hope you have a great day . have fun in everything. and if I see you, great! If I don't.. then there's always another day
Is what good?
I need to make it first :P
yeah :P. sorry about stuffs
I hope it's not awful :P. but bye (:. you're super amazing. sorry
See ya :D. Goodnight I suppose. And sweet dreams. (:. and sorry for everything. And if you didn't notice me running, I kinda forgot that I left something in the oven.. so I had to go get that. :P. sorry. Hi?
sorry. I should probably leave you alone 
It was I got there with a minute to spare. Yeah.. well I wouldn't want to be bothersome
You sure you're not tired of me?
I just felt like... stuffs. :P
mostly. key word there. I'm just going to go before you hurt my self esteem any further. I felt like you didn't want to talk to me today.. I don't know why... I'm sorry
I honestly only called before to hear your voice. as weird as that may sound. but you sounded so busy . like you wanted me to stop talking
I understand
And it's okay
It may have started because I said some silly things and it seemed like you ignored it. I don't know
nothing important
I vaguely remember. and saying it again wouldn't make much a difference
It was.. a while ago. It doesn't matter. I'm just stupid
I should probably just let you get to bed
It's cool. I shouldn't have called
I don't know what you're sorry for
Nah, you're perfect. no need to apologize
I wasn't really sad. I was worried that my stuff was going to burn. It had to come out within an hour of going in the oven
Oh it's fine. I made it on time. I just had to sprint to my house
not really. Just had to make it in on time. If I had walked it would have been burnt for sure
oh.. my bad. I.. didn't know. I'm sorry
sounds like something to be excited about. I'm sorry for seeming sad earlier. but pretty much anything that could have gone wrong went wrong
I woke up early. I opened one of the cuts already on my knuckle
My bucket of dirt tipped over on the grass. I'm alright in the morning I just didn't want to wake up. especially not during that dream
What party?
Oh yeah :P. that :P. well yeah. And my teeth hurt. like the dentist said
Nope. And my cheesecake making failed. several times
I meant no to the advil. the dirt was when I was digging a hole for a plant
you are, it's crazy
You have a lot of aspiration . Which is awesome. I also felt in the way of your game of pool. because I felt like that was something you were supposed to do with Twe. I felt really in the way :P
the working early and the cheesecake stuff was all my fault
umm.. I didn't have the ingredients for the cheesecake stuff. so no way is that your fault. and I chose to stay awake. because I really really like talking to you
It was more like my sister ate all the eggs and my sour cream turned
I know
Somethings take time. :P. kidding of course
I didn't have a bad day.. and I wasn't sad. I was just having an off day
and things worked out pretty well
I think anyways. so thank you
No.. for wanting to help. I mean.. you really don't need to help. I could just.. die in a hole 
but no.. you wouldn't let me :P
No, thank you. Don't be sorry. I... :P. sorry. yeah, rainbows. :P. I should probably let you get some sleep. sorry for keeping you awake. I'm also sorry for everything
Not really. :P. You're way cooler. you're so much better than I could ever be. I want to say something.. but I don't think it's something I should.. nor do I think you'd care. so I'll just let you get some sleep
You're still higher. I would say something. but still. :P. It's late.. maybe if I see you tomorrow I'll tell you then
Oh.. I'm sorry. I wouldn't want to force you to see me. If I do though.. it'd be pretty neat (:. anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams. and thank you for being here for me. Although I'm sorry for keeping you here
See you tomorrow?
or not.. because that would be okay too
Oh, well that's really awesome :D. I sort of forgot :P. So I'll see you then (:
See you earlier if like.. that'd be cool too. if not I completely understand :P. sorry. I'll just go. bye
Great idea
if I wake up then at least :P
I probably won't. sorry. You'd probably have to run alone. unless you called and woke me up :P. sorry :/
I'll just leave
any other time I'd be completely fine :P. sorry.. goodnight, Leandra. Sweet dreams and all of those things (:
You're way cooler
You so are :D
I'll catch ya on the flip side. :P. buh bye
Same.. here
I unfortunately don't have soup
so I'm just going to go to bed sad :P
Yes. and in this instant I'm one of 'em. Too bad. but good for you :D. Have fun with your soup mission
I've never even heard of it. but you should save the explanation . because you really should go off to bed. because I'd feel terrible if I made you sleep deprived 
Yeah.. maybe one will randomly hit you and you'll just stop talking for a prolonged amount of time. :P. And for the rest of the night I'd be wondering "Did I bore her to sleep?". so called it :P. I suppose I'll just go then. bye
Well.. I'll probably be like that tomorrow night :P. I'm such a party pooper. :P. sorry. G'night, Leandra. You're the bestest (:
I am sorry. and I wanted to say more. but I can forget about it. have a nice day n' stuff. and have fun volunteering (:
(:
Same :D
You could call. I'll just pick up super quickly

I wish I could call you too. And a party would be overboard :P. I think at least . Anyway, Goodnight, Leandra and sweet dreams. you're more perfect. (:  
It's me 
Haha, it's fine
Goodnight w/sweet dreams (:  . (:
I love you too (:
Nah
Expensive place. It's a winter place too :P  . but I've had fun sleeping

Probably different days :P Still stuck on the couch and I like you too :D I want to see that movie so bad (: anyway.. Goodnight and sweet dreams!. You're amazing! (:. Hi. sorry. I hope you're having a good day (:. :P. I wouldn't wanna talk to me either :P but I do hope you're having fun :D. Is it bad that I'd really like to talk to you? But it looks like I missed ya. Aw, well.. I suppose it's early but.. goodnight and sweet dreams. Oh, and I really like you (:. sorry.. :P
It's fine that you left it up, I was just a little disappointed when I couldn't talk to you because you're amazing and perfect (:.. and I miss you so much, so yeah, I can't wait to see you either. Only 4 days to go (I'm counting today because it's early still :P) . To comment on "I'm just like.. me." you are, and that's why you're amazing (: You're my bestfriend :D .. and my girlfriend :P
It could be
And driving must have been fun
Very impressive!
You're welcome
You're way more awesome by the by
You can look it up.. it has a website. And it's not.. not fun. you know?
The resort has a website
and it's.. not unenjoyable. it's just not.. fun fun
Nah
Yeah. I'm sorry about earlier
I don't know. I said stuffs
You sure?. I felt like I was being annoying
It really doesn't
I've heard of meatloaf. but meatcake sounds very silly
Nah
Not really. It's fine
you're way cooler
It couldn't be that amazing. I'm not wearing sunglasses either
That's silly. but.. you're soo so amazing . Way amazing. (:
Yeah you are :D. Je t'aime. (:
Possibly
sorry
Oh. well... alright
I could imagine
Oh, wifi in the hotel room
and.. okay :/. I suppose you have to go driving anyway. I'm sorry
I think I'm going tomorrow
Today was a lazy day. and we were going to stay inside the entire time
sigh. yeah
of course
oh, nothing. I should probably let you get to that driving
Nah. I'm boring anyway
That's nice. And I'm not cool. You've got important things to attend to. so I'll just letcha go
It's nothing important. Go have fun
You've only got 3 more days of freedom
Freedom from me I mean. and maybe a sad sigh?. But it really doesn't matter
How could it be sad and lonely?
Nah, there's gotta be plenty of people who are way more fun and amazing. I'm just some guy
Nah, nothing special. I'm just a guy you know
I don't know how. :P. You should go have some fun with your driving n' what not and enjoy these last 3 days
A countdown? Really?
:/. It's unfortunately gone
I can always make more though
haha
"There's a playstation in the oven". :P
Exactly :D
naturally 
Well it's still nice to read (:
I feel like I should wait. Although I've already told you the same thing already. but.. just in french :P
yeah, sorry
It's kinda hard to translate, isn't it?. ish :P
Well.. 
Although it doesn't mean much on facebook, as you said. I'd like to say I love you too
I may be home early-ish Sunday
It would be neat to see you and tell you it then. But it could be a long shot
I mean it could be a long shot whether I come home early or not. But I'd really like to see you as soon as possible
And it's just 3 days. Oh.. fun :P
I've been pretty bored
But it's not.. bad I suppose. Yeah, food is good :D. haha
Me too. It's always much better than regular food. anyway.. I should probably let you go have fun
And remember, it's only 3 days.. and I'm not so great
You're super amazing and perfect (:. You're the bestest
but you know.. I'm not so great because that makes waiting on me.. easier?. I don't know what I'm saying. But waiting on something amazing takes a while in my experience
If you say so
Nah :P. but... I'm really glad I'm yours. (if you still want me)
(:
Oh whoa?
That's the place. but I haven't been tubing at that place in forever
It pretty much is
No. That wouldn't be safe. Because it's kinda.. not as slick as it appears
haha. of course
I miss you.. a lot. And I've been thinking of you nonstop 
Of course. But.. still. I miss seeing your smile. as.. corny as that may sound
haha, thanks
Nah, you are. :D
Well.. from where I am.. you are. haha.. that Big Time Rush show is pretty much the only thing on tv. so that movie thing on saturday got me excited. but I'm going to miss it. Anyway, I should probably let you get to some really exciting stuff
haha, that one
You don't have to record it. I'm sure I can catch a rerun. I think at least
Or you were just planned ahead :P
haha. alright
:P. I'll talk to you.. some other time
who knows when :P
But um.. umm.. . I really really like you (:
I'm glad too (:. You're amazing
Well.. you're amazing to me
(:. That's.. awesome. some things I may have typed may have not sent. So.. buh bye. so you're fun to talk to too (:. Goodnight n' sweet dreams if I don't get the chance to tell you later
so don't be sorry

spaz attack on the computer. no, you're so perfect (:
But I should probably let you get to stuff

haha
You're special to me n' stuff. and.. yeah.. you're amazing. so.. sweet dreams (:
You too. You're way cooler. and I can't wait to tell you stuffs for when I see you

haha, of course
anyway, bye bye for now (:
or.. tah tah. :P

Fantastic
No problem. Bye :D. I can't wait for Sunday to roll around :P. Hey again . :P. my bad, sorry. Goodnight and sweet dreams, Leandra. I hope you have a great day tomorrow (:. sigh :P
I noticed :P. Yeah, goodnight (:. You're amazing :D
"I don't know why I love you I just know I can't stop thinking about you.". You always make me smile (:
You can hide in closets. it's rather difficult in a dresser
Well.. I'm not
so it's difficult
What happened today? 
Oh. The clock on this computer is.. 3 hours of. off*
so I haven't been able to tell
Me?
And that tomorrow never comes?. and you're perfect (:
Yeah, I knew that
I suppose it isn't important enough to think about
That's awesome?
sorry.. not a question
They get eaten 
by the dresser
Yes!
Well.. . Fancy pants :P. they need to be hung so that they don't get wrinkled :P
They can
but jeans aren't important :P
and wrinkling is less likely. Well.. I used to. but only my khakis 
haha
yeah. I somehow remembered that the "kh" was included
You're way cooler
umm okay?
I don't believe I do
I.. unfortunately went on a walk. and wasn't lazy. and before you say "Oh that's nice". it wasn't. I saw something that I wish I could unsee
Yeah.. I can't tell you
Similar. larger scale though
It was pretty bad
I don't want to talk about it..
maybe :P. How about something positive?. Like.. . You're perfect (:
sorry. Oh.. it was something true :D
I liked my positive thought more :D. Just thinking of you makes me smile (:
(:. I like you too :D
Well I can't wait. and by that.. I can. but.. you know what I mean :P. This loud pop just scared me :/. I was sleepy.. but now I'm terrified
It was.. WAY louder than bubblewrap. and no one else is in the room
Sorry. The internet died
and yesterday the door slammed closed so that scared me I'm starting to think this place is haunted
But he's cool and funny. this is scary :'(. LIke.. I went to open the door fully. and before my hand got to it. it slammed closed
I don't kow. know*
but I was the only one here
I'm only safe in your arms (corniest thing ever :P). sorry
well.. you may think that. okay.. another noise. ... . I'm going to get murdered
okay..
but only because I trust you a whole lot (:
Everyone else is asleep. (:. I'm in a lit room. and the noises are happening anyway. and I can't explain them. but I trust you. so.. I'll be fine 
I'm.. still a bit jumpy. so I'll probably need to calm down. but you have to get some sleep too, so.. . I'll just.. try my best to calm down alone :P. Thank you for being here (:
really really really creepy noise. it's like something is growly at me. and another pop
Go clean your room, I'm freaking out :P
THe noises. the*. I wouldn't freak out because of you. you're amazing (:
See what?. My zune died . like.. once I got here. so no music. but more importantly... see what?
:/. You're perfect.. okay? (:. and you're beyond amazing.. I just say you're amazing because words can't actually describe how.. amazing you are . .. I really really like you (:
haha, it does sound cheesy. But I don't care.. I'll say it anyway (:. You're my everything
I know. I wanted to say it anyway
haha. I'll just always be on the look out then
haha.. not creepy. but either way I'll just never know that you said it. :P
hmmm.. maybe. Maybe I'll dream of it :P
Was I being really weird in that dream?. Like.. was I bowling?
I think they may have stopped. and I like you too (:. a lot :D
haha. that they are
Okay.. I'm going to pretend that noise is from the faucet 
I love pudding :D. Don't let me get in the way of the pudding :P. have fun with that . and goodnight/morning sweet dreams (sweet pudding?)
Well.. you're a dream. (:. so my dreaming is off to a good start. Corny.. I know
I really really really really really like you (:
(:
It's absorbent . and tasty. and you could be all like . "I loaf you dough much"
:D. Anyway
Goodnight, Leandra
Or the marshmallows just.. make it sound like "Di ruffs du row wush"
You're even cuter
Maybe
(: You're perfect too. I loaf you (:
haha. that... sounds.. bad :/
like "I *dread* you"
It does. and I'm sorry. I love you too. I don't know.. if you actually said it though. but umm.... sorry. You're the bestest (:
Very scary. and.. aw (:
Hotels are the scariest. especially when it sounds like something is poking at the door
I'm scared to look. My neck.. is killing me. sorry.. random. anyway.. I should let you get to that thing. that you mentions. mentioned*
I don't know.. the couch?. maybe :P
It's alright. I'm good at that too. but I woke up this morning and my head was hanging off the edge
I usually do. :P
oh?
See.. I don't move much in my own bed. it's like.. other beds :P
I'm mostly trying to get comfortable
sorry.. I got lost. but yeah.. I'm alright in my personal bed :P. Umm... You make me smile (:
where did the churches part come from?. You're amazing (:. So so so glad I'm yours
(:. And I'm sorry that you got lost. I would have been your guide
I kinda wish I could have played that game with you. Sardines
Yeah. still :/
I know. sory. sorry*
nah, you are :D. I'm just me :P
(:. I didn't know it was possible. but you somehow gave me more butterflies :P
It's like.. the words you say are caterpillars 
pretty much. yeah :P. although that was very technical.. you make me extremely happy (:. And butterfly-y
What's to understand?. You're amazing and perfect (:. And.. you're so nice. I can't wait either.. but I have to :P
I love you so much and the internet connection pooped out again.. so you probably won't get this
so yeah.. everything you do is just perfect and there's no one else that could make me happier
darn
man.. I was just trying to get that off my chest. And since the internet wasn't working.. I thought I was able to
sorry
haha. I'm the luckiest guy ever (:. and the bad connection means that I won't get what you sent until the connection comes back :P
Well I've got you too. the clover thing?. I found one Sunday
and about 14 thursday
It's unbelievable how lucky I am to be yours though. sorry. I should probably let you get to bed or something. (:
I think the same about you (:. Just.. everything about you is amazing
You're so perfect too (:. Goodnight, Leandra (:. You're the bestest. :D
The funny thing is that it's a sleeper sofa :P. and I hope you sleep awesomely as well (:. Sweet dreams!. (the funny thing is that it's more comfortable as a sofa..)
Goodnight (:. Sweet dreams and wonderful things
You're perfect (:
I love you too (:. Goodnight again (:
I was about to say the same thing... like both of those things. but you beat me to it. so don't be sorry (:. I hope you have a fantastic day and if I don't get the chance to talk to you then.. yeah (:. Just remember you're perfect. and I'll be thinking of you (:. I don't know if that sounds creepier.. outside of my head. sorry :P

Green circles?

Oh. I gotcha :P. I was confused for a moment
Yeah

I didn't have anything to do. and.. I miss you :/
Yeah.. today is my last day. and I've been here several times. and it's a resort.. so nothing much to do
haha. I don't see how I could affect the amount of fun. but okay. sounds like fun (:
I don't see how :P
Whoa. crazy
Still :P. It.. sounds to me like you've had a lot of fun without me
psh :P. Why would you want me in town?
It's been raining a lot here.. so that makes it difficult to do stuffs
Well.. lightning storms too. and that means no :P
Umm.. no? 
There's really not much to see

But.. golden eggs :D. You should climb the Beanstalk and see what kind of adventures you could have
Then let it grow :D. just kiding. kidding*
Yum
I'd say so
yes :D. He was one smart shopper
I remember that there's a movie about his ancestor climbing up the bean stalk
No. it wasn't. It was like.. for him to give his family a new name
Jack is a movie about a kid who is 12 but looks 40
Umm.. Kickin' It Old School was about a guy who went into a coma for like 30 years
Different movies
The who>. ?*. sorry
oh yeah. sorry. I remember that though
haha. I bet you could
You're cooler. Haha, alright

I'll try to.. I have nothing to do :P
Oh.. I can pack :P. I hope you have an amazing day (:
I want to go home. That means I'd be able to see you (:. sorry
I'm here a lot. :P. And you're amazing
I know I see you a lot. sorry for that. It's probably not that fun for you
I love seeing you too (:. You're perfect and everything
Well.. I should probably let you get to your stuffs. I really really really like you (:. Have a great day :D
You're the bestest (:. Have a lot of fun with that'. It sure sounds like fun :D. Fun without me must be the greatest :D
I guess I don't have an idea :P. But I'm sure I'm right :P
nah. that's silly. anyway, have fun . You're amazing (:
I don't think you could prove it, but maybe some day. and I'm no fun. so it doesn't travel with me:P. :P *. anyway, bye (:
haha. That's still silly. :P. I <3 you (:. sorry
I'm looking forward to it
haha (:
You're perfect. bye

Sorry that I have to leave?. why would you be sory. sorry?*. Do you not want me to come back?
... umm okay. if you say so. I didn't want to come..
Because I left you?. I mean.. that's part of it. but I've been coming here since 2006. it's boring
haha, thank you?
:P. You're warm to (:. too*
Aw? Why not?
I'm sorry. I wish I could be there to help :P. sorry, kidding
haha, very comfy. I wish I knew :P
haha. good point
an explosion of awesome :D
Naturally . hah, sorry. You're probably tired n' stuff
Yeah, like. I should let you get some sleep
I'm not getting to sleep anytime soon. but of course.. I should let you :P
Oh.. I'm not tired
my back kinda.. hurts a lot
Do you now?. Well it could be the couch :P
It's difficult to sleep. but I should be fine
all over.. and my neck
It's been hurting for a good part of the week. but maybe it'll be magical and stop hurting. so you wouldn't have to :D
I bet it's already perfect :D. because.. you're perfect (:
Not quite? pshh... you're so perfect (:. You're the bestest :D
:/. and that's nice :D. sorry.... I suppose I should let you get to sleep
Yeah, it'd be very cool
but yeah.. goodnight
Don't miss me, there's not much to miss. but yeah.. sweet dreams n' all
I'm not around though. so you know :P
silly :P. sorry. I hope you're safe n' stuff. the closet sounds very scary
Change in air pressure. or a ghost
Yeah.. so just think that by closing the one door. you changed the air pressure. forcing the other door open
Something scared me last night. but it was really funny
Oh.. I was thinking that I should let you get to sleep and stop bothering you. so.. I could tell you like.. some other time
you're what?. scary story?
Aw.. well okay. Goodnight then. I'm sorry n' stuff
I'm sorry
it's not. it's kinda dumb. so don't be excited
haha, nah. none of my stories are. You have to be awesome to have awesome stories :P
nah
and the sink just turned on
(: I like you bunches too :D. by itself. I'm the only one awake up here
nah.. it turned off on it's own
probably I guess. The whole handle went up and down though :P
haha. It did it with it's magical whiskers. or.. it has magical powers because of it's nose twitches 
something like that :D
haha :D. no doubt. that was it :D. my neck :'(. haha
nah.. it's whatever
I may be wrong about the nose twitches though. Because I can also do that :P
haha, it does. makes it a whole lot worse. but thanks 
nah, no magic here
I don't have one, unfortunately
I do have a regular pillow. but yeah.. I'm not magical :P
I'm not. but it's not so bad. I just.. gotta ignore it :P
haha. You're perfect and amazing (:. I.. 
(:. sorry
Yes you are (:. and (: (:. sorry
It's just another day, right?. haha, you make me so happy. and smiley 
I love talking to you too (:. You're the bestest person ever
You're still the bestest
And you're my bestfriend
I love being with you too. but I'm sorry if it's too much
I don't mind at all
I have no idea
haha 
it's fine. I was just going to tell you something. but I can just tell you tomorrow. (if I get the chance)
I mean like.. if I get home n' stuff
Yeah, Monday, definitely. if you want
haha, neat (:. Well.. I should let you get some sleep
It's going to hurt no matter what :P. so it's okay. sleep is more important
It's okay. Pain is alright
I wouldn't want to keep you up
I know pain is bad.. I just don't want to keep you awake
I'm sitting down. :P. But I can always sleep. I'm making you miss out on like.. sweet dreams n' stuff
haha . It's fine. I liked it. it was cute :3. If you didn't say it I would have said it 
haha, thanks
that's good I suppose
I hope too
I have no idea
I have :P
Awesome
Nah.. in science one day
6th grade I think
Oh.. maybe I was wrong then
Me neither
Why are you asking me?
Little drops of gluten . :P
yeah . too bad for them
you should be sorry :P. It's just silly
(:. I like being with you too. you're amazing
I feel the same way (:. I love your everything (:
I love you too. (:
You're like.. all that and more. I felt like I was just repeating you.. but like yeah (:. You're amazing and perfect and yeah (:
Well like.. you're nice, funny, smart, and everything. You're just perfect
and.. the lions sound cool (:
Awesome movie (:
I wanted to watch it because we started it in English
but we never finished it
Nope :/
We stopped near the beginning
I know. but we got busy n' stuff
well it'd be awesome to watch it with you. if you wanted. I can always watch it alone
Which I've done :P
You're fun :D
So I think we have to be together for it to be full
How can I be love? :P. I shouldn't question it.. but I'm lost :P
Oh, that makes sense. in that case you're love too (:
Only if you'll be mine
(:
It's not an official pinky promise yet though. I'll have to see you as soon as possible to fix that
haha, of course :D
Neither have I. I was afraid I'd break the one that I found
because it was old
Yeah I chose not to test my luck. so I let it be. but maybe I could have survived?. Because having you makes me super lucky (:
I do too
but nah.. I'm super lucky because of you. and that it is
but that's not important stuff. You're important (:
I think it does
You're amazing
I don't.. only tv shows. and you should (:. You're so amazing and special. If like.. I couldn't make you feel special than I'd just be a bad person. not that you need me to feel special. because you are either way (:. Sorry.. I'm rambling. I suppose I should just say goodnight?. sorry.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:
haha. awesome (:
Well.. since you were already dozing off.. I should just let you sleep. (:. That's good (:
I like talking to you too. but sleep is more important. and there's always.. hopefully tomorrow
Nah, sleep is way more important. but I hope so too
It's a necessity . whereas I'm not :P
Yeah :P. You need sleep. You don't need me
aw (:. me too. I just..  yeah (;. (: *
oh.. you do? :/. Just kidding, it's not a bad thing :P
sorry . but no, it was a good thing.. in my opinion at least. I hope at least
(:. I couldn't ask for any more
I'll always be your bestest friend. as long as that's what you want
Don't apologize (:. It's fine . I'd say the same (:
I don't know.. is it?
same (:. I.. . sory
I love you. 
(:
Really? You too?
I love yours (:
sorry, but it's amazing. I should probably let you get to sleep with a smile. so.. goodnight, Leandra (:. Sweet dreams
I like reading them (:. How what is crazy?
Crazy for you maybe :P
Maybe you just lucked out in this instant. But I wouldn't really call it luck
I don't know
haha, I suppose that. but like... it wouldn't be lucky for you. because it's just me:P. :P *
Aw (:. Well.. okay :P. I think you're perfect and so amazing . and.. I'm sorry if I'm a little obsessed
:P
Nope
It was extremely cool though. And yeah (:. I'd love to hear about it :D
haha, yeah
Of course!
You're amazing at everything you do. why not driving too?
Nice (:. Very fashionable
haha :D. I should let you sleep. before you fall asleep without warning
a great idea (:
I'll survive. :D
I'll be fine. Just sleep well (:
I'm 3 hours away..
:P
oh, of course. It'll be fine. As long as you sleep well. and stuff. I really care about you (:
Well I'm extremely happy (:. so just don't worry about the other part
Don't waste your wishes on me :P. but thanks (:. Goodnight, Leandra. Sweet dreams :D. I love you.
You too (:. You're amazing
Bye (:
sleep tight . (:
I thought I said *sweet* dreams :P. anyway, thanks and bye for now. :D
Right. well.. that's good to know. I am finally home, by the way. not that that's important or anything. I'm here earlier than I had anticipated :P. I'm sorry about stuffs :P. And I wish I said more than I did, sorry. but.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:. maybe we could run tomorrow :P
crazy :P. I downloaded the workout thing
I'm not aware of that way, I'm sorry
ah. gotcha. I now know
It's okay. thanks for trying (:. I'm really glad you cared enough to try
haha, thanks :P
that.. is awesome :D. and.. I don't think I spent enough time with you . because I.. I still sort of miss you, even though I saw you just then :P
:D. Impressive!
Even cooler. I should probably let you get some sleep
Hopefully there is always tomorrow to talk?
I'm really cold :P. haha, you could. but don't hurt yourself
sure :P
Exactly
yup. So be safe!
alright. awesome. I.. don't want to say bye. but I know I have to :/. I was kinda disappointed that I didn't get to see you all that much
haha, me too (:. you're amazing. but I'm sorry about stuffs
Which hug?
and you're perfect!
aw, no. it's okay. I'm as much to blame. That's actually what I was sorry about :P
mostly the awkward one during the thumb war. and it's not okay. You made it clear . I'm sorry
You don't seem to be
You actually seem like.. something else :P
I like being with you too (:
Oh.. well.. I mean I was gone for only 7 days.. it just seemed like you were cool with it. like you could care less
thanks. well.. yeah. I wanted to hug you too.. but like I said.. you seemed like you could care less 
Or that I was back :P
Well.. you did a great job playing it off cool
It's alright, with good intentions. I just didn't know how to act though.. because I was really happy to see you.. and you were just regular
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell. But I believe you
haha, it's cool. But I really did feel like just another friend :P
It's alright. I just get confused :P
haha. I'm sorry. I'm just.. getting mixed signals.. and I don't know what I'm doing
I missed you a lot too
I do trust you. and you're perfect too
stabbing me?
nah.. not really. Just.. didn't help :P
oh. well never mind then. alright. goodnight then
nah. I just.. I feel like you want me around.. but you don't want me close
umm.. no. emotionally?. You want me around physically like.. physically there. but usually I feel like that's just it :P
possibly. sorry
You do
I don't know how to explain it. but like.. I feel like a friend most of the time. which is great. you're my bestfriend (:. but like... I don't know.. being a boyfriend could be nice
(:
sorry. I should let you get to sleep too. and stop plaguing you :P
Oh.. stop bothering you. but I felt like I say that too much :P
Yeah :P. I'm sorry for everything. I feel like I do everything wrong
Stuffs
like.. you want to be friends. and I just want to hold your hand. (as the Beatles say)
Nah, you're perfect. it has to be me. :P
Oh contraire 
haha :P. But seriously.. you're perfect. so perfect (:. I just love being with you 
haha, maybe
Oh yeah, I almost forgot
Is it bad?
Well.. you don't have to
haha. that it could be. I suppose I'll just be worrying over what it is :P
Still going to worry :p
haha.. I'm going to throw it away :P. And I will. because that's what I do >:O
Eh.. yeah :P
That would be sweet
haha
I can't believe it sometimes. sorry. you were saying?
I can't believe you.. how amazing you are. and how lucky I am
I'm still not convinced that I'm awake
I'd want to remember it though. Because you're the greatest dream imaginable 
Not even imaginable
because you're perfect (:
Well.. you're amazing and you should feel the same way right?. I'm just reminding you
Well.. I may not think it... but I must be pretty amazing for you to want me around
I mean.. It couldn't be explained any other way
I'd like to see you try :P. I'll prove the same to you. and..
I.. will tell you what I want to say when I see you next (:
Hopefully. You're perfect (:. In every way. haha, you're my everything :D. sorry :P
 (:. That's what I was saying sorry for :P. the cheesiness :P. but.. (:
sorry 
aww.. you're so amazong (:. amazing*. sorry. I'm dumb
You're so perfect (:. I'm so glad I'm yours. (if you still want me)
I thought I said that :P
haha. Well.. I'll always want to be yours and I really liked tonight too (:. You're so amazing and everything (: (:
aw.. :/. Denying it isn't cool. it's so true! (:
I'll try my best to make you believe it. You're way cooler (:
Doing stuffs later maybe sounds amazing :D. I suppose you're right
so.. goodnight, Leandra (:
Sweet dreams
I wish I could.. protect you from scary dreams
But I feel like I'm more likely to cause them
haha.. really cheesy but.. I don't need to dream when I've got you . sorry.. I'm just going to go
Sweet-amazing-awesome-caramel dreams. you're so cute (:
I'm pretty lucky too (:. Bye, Leandra :D
Yeah, who knows?. I could just be jinx'd :P
Yeah, I hope the same for you. sleep well. and I hope that you're warm :P. Because I'm freezing 
It's not, no worries. I'll just be warm some other time I suppose :P
Yeah.. I gotta find me one of those :P. sorry . thank you (:. and goodnight :D
ttfn (:
haha :D. You're.. amazing!. I don't know how many times I can say that . sorry. Hey, it's you
Yeah, but I'm less important :P. What's more important is you! and that you're here
nah
Umm.. I got to say hi to you. you?
It is so fun. sorry. Have I caught you at a bad time?. Because I can go :P
I can always quit bothering you
I'm cheering you up?
Shouldn't you be happy in the first place?. What is there to cheer up? :P
Well I suppose that's good then. I'm glad you're happy
Am I happy? I suppose I am
I suppose so. That's nice
makes sense
Who knows. maybe it will
yes it would
nope. It's like I never left. but it still feels like I'm gone
I mean.. I'm still just sitting here alone. I don't have anything to do. and no one would want to do anything with me in the first place. but the lack of rain is alright
Maybe I did mean you. but being alone is okay
I've done it for 7 days
Yeah. different kind of alone feeling
Yeah I suppose :P
Maybe that's just what I need to do :P
haha, that could be cool. I wouldn't want to waste your days though
I unfortunately never found the time. and haven't remembered until you just told me
I've got it open. no worries
nah
there are 4 different types of games that I've found. Yeah, seems simple :P
It's crazy, I know
yeah, sorry.... sorry for everything.. 
Candy's better anyway
sorry, again
I didn't know that. sounds extreme. And I'm just sorry for a lame reason that you're not aware of. but I'm sorry about it anyway
it's not important. Just someone was talking to me.. 
and stuffs
Oh.. they just made a big deal about me being gone n' stuff. and something related in an unrelated way.. I don't really like the feeling of just being your friend
no, it's whatever. I'm sorry
nah, trust me
It's whatever. like.. nothing at all :P. no worries
I'll get over it
Maybe you can. I don't know how though. plus you don't need to worry about it. and I wouldn't want to waste your time
I'm not worrying about it :P. and I'm a complete waste of time. hmm.. I think I chipped my tooth
I haven't. It feels sharper. and I definitely am
yeah :P. and I still am
yeah :P
Very possible. I would be there to help if you wanted though
Oh.. I just thought it'd be a nice excuse to see you. but alright. I'm good here too I suppose
I may still be a wreck. but I would
Wreck from the bed. :P
don't be sorry. and the word fits very well
nah. it's more like amazing doesn't fit
Well.. the email is more urgent . so don't worry about me. I'm not going anywhere :P
alright
okay. something like that?. Sounds like busy :P. I can go if you're busy 
Of course trapeeze walking is my favorite activity. :P. all I know is I'd like to do something with you
yeah
aw, well shucks. that's a real bummer
darn
Yeah, shucks. I don't know why.. but I feel like a big waste of time. yeah :P... I should probably let you get to something important
Nah, I can find something to do. just so that you can make sure you get that email
I.. live right next to it
I could be free in a lil bit
I will.. I should probably go then. And I'll let you know immediately 
It's fine. Just give me a few minutes and I'll get back to you on it. and in the mean time you can do that email stuffs. or something or other. I wish I had purple spray paint
Well I can go buy some :P. Anyway.. I'll be back as soon as possible
you could say that. it's just a little project I'm starting on. but yeah.. be back in a jiffy :P
I'm back. I didn't take too long I hope :P
No, I don't have any . I can always make a trip to Michaels though :P
you didn't know, so it's cool :P
nah, it's cool. so.. still want to do something?
Doesn't matter to me. as long as I get to see you
Sounds like fun 
cool
awesome
see you soon?
Or anywhere you want
okay, good. Alright, 6 it is. See you soon
Bye. haha.. I feel kinda silly :P. and I'm sorry too 
I don't know. I felt silly. because of that "What?" that you said
Yeah. before you left
What did you mean it in?
well like.. I'm sorry for hugging you and stuff
No like.. I wanted to hug you.. and you were all like "what?". So I was all like.. was this a bad idea?. I don't know.. I was kind of confused
What else would I do?
umm... okay
sorry...
It's my fault. I shouldn't have. I'm.. getting conflicting opinions. And I'm so confused. I'm sorry
It's not.. just you . Like.. I'm being confused because of other people
I don't know
It's cool. it's mostly the other person. because I feel like you're one way.. and they're telling me the other deal
I.. don't know. Like it's weird. and bad. and confusing
Do you understand it when you say: oh?. I don't know. Like..
Oh well. I feel like.. I have to hold everything back. because I don't know what you're thinking. and.. yeah
No I mean like... I'd like to maybe hold your hand.. or something or other
sorry. But the person is telling me bad stuff
Nah.. you're perfect. I'm just getting confused by conflicting opinions
And I like my opinion. I'm sorry. I just.. what do you think?
Well.. I'd like that stuff. But like.. in all seriousness it's not important. I think you're what's special and as long as I've got you I'm not really missing much. But the opinion of the other person tells me to be "assertive"
Oh, you're so so so special. you're like.. the best thing to ever happen to me
You're my *best* friend for a reason (:. You deserve it the most
I would have. Needed to finish the movie, right?. Plus.. more time with you :D
haha, exactly!. But yeah.. that other opinion... it says "Kissing is a right of passage"
and like.. all I could say was "wow". See?. You too
I don't know. to.. being a teenager?. They aren't making a very good argument
No.. like.. they haven't convinced me
to be honest that's what I thought the "What?" was about
No like.. I don't know. See.. I know how you feel about kisses. so I respect that
And when I went to hug you and you said "what?". That's what I thought it was about
yeah
Like.. none of that huh?
I can't tell whether you are or not. I mean.. you can hug a stranger.. and be fine in public. (that Nathan guy)
sure :P
gotta share a special moment like that.. alone?
Nah, I understand. that makes a lot of sense. because it is special and it's gotta be just between you and me. not with the entire world. because they don't need to know
I wish I could only talk to you in person.. because then I'd be seeing you a lot :D
haha, I know :D. But talking about this sort of stuff is better in person :P
Oh, no. not at all. I'm sorry
Like.. when?. I was mostly trying to see things in your point of view. which.. is difficult. because I barely know what you're thinking
Nah, you're amazing. but no.. I'm sorry. like.. I don't know. Like, I felt like you could hug him no problem. but it's different for me
Well.. I guess I didn't see it all. Because we were looking for you.. and that was the first thing I saw
well, yeah. or if I saw less
Really?
I see. well.. yeah. makes sense
why not?
weird. sorry
You make my heart beat faster. haha, go for it. especially for me :P
Oh, phew. I got a little worried
I really don't know how to act most of the time. and yeah
well with you. Because like.. . I don't know what you want
Yeah, that sounds nice
haha.. but I'm not going to lie. You give me butterflies. and hugging me only makes them flutter more. so.. I kinda like it :P
I've got this circular hole inbetween my ring finger and my pinky
It is a bit.. dart shaped
Oh.. I was having like.. a great time. And I think it just happened. but whatever did it.. was this like.. amazing thing. and worth it
Honestly.. I wouldn't change a thing that happened yesterday
Doing a great job.. hurt me yesterday and the day before
Nah.. you'll have to start next week. fresh start, you know. you can continue to hurt me from now until sunday :D
haha, it's okay. except... remember how you said "I'll never hurt you". well.... completely lying. just kidding. sorry
haha, it's cool. Like.. you can hurt me as much as you want. I would just like it if you wouldn't break my heart.. becasue that hurts the most
I believe you (:. I wouldn't either. and like.. I trust you.. a whole lot
Let me down how?
Well I doubt you could
Nah, there's no way. Well.. you found a way of course. but now way I am :P
Well.. you're definitely perfect too (:
It's fine, I didn't even notice that it got late. I was too focused talking to you
haha, I was distracted by how amazing I think you are (:
nah. I wasn't there
I was trying to get the 5. :P. I forgot.. did I tell you how I was confused?
I'm not confused really. but more like. conflicting ideas from different people. like one side says I should just be chill, the other assertive and the final side just doesn't show the full opinion
Yeah. We'll taking things slow means you can enjoy the ride for longer. if that makes sense
well*
haha. wasn't speaking of them
I was kidding. go on about them>. ?*
I am
We can always continue said conversation in person if that's better
Good idea!. With that being said... Were you planning on falling asleep soon?
I was only asking because you said you were sleepy. And I wouldn't want to keep you up
Possibly
The confusion is good
haha. kidding.. of course. it's.. terrible
:/
Oh I was kidding again. sorry
sorry :/. to be honest it's like.. . the person I was talking to was talking about kissing. and they were like.. "it's amazing". and I was like "okay". and.. yeah
Yeah. :P
haha. See.. that's the conflicting ideas. And to be honest I could care less. but.. it's confusing to hear both of those things
what was what?. Oh.. wait... wait.. what?
Oh.. how it's bad :P. Possibly :P. Raining?. Okay. I looked outside to check. and something moved past my window
I'm terrified now
No.. something moved past my window. Oh yeah.. and like.. I'm mostly confused as to which opinion to listen to. so far I'm siding with you
it's a murderer
I'm going to die
axe murderer?. And no.. like... For me I really don't think it's as great as they say. but they hit me with "How would you know?". I mean.. I suppose it's a "special" thing.. but I feel like for them it just happens all the time.. making it.. not special at all
Yeah :P
umm yes I do?. that has something to do with what?
:D. awesome. but yeah. I feel like.. the "specialness" of a kiss is taken away . because it just never stops for some people
sorry
But it's true :P
haha. I'm sorry. I'm just saying. like.. it's not like.. a bad thing. but it's become such a habit that it doesn't really mean much
Yeah.. I don't think that falls under the same category. :P
but like.. the person said "I like kissing" and it kinda weirded me out. because like.. you shouldn't like the act. but you should like the person :P. and.. I think it's possible too 
It shouldn't be everything, ya know?
and "nice and everything"? :P
haha, you're perfect (:. And I guess that makes sense
Bad why?. I completely get where you're coming from. Hugging you is super special.
I wouldn't want to make you do that though. Like.. what if it makes you less happy?. You make me extremely happy no matter what
I feel like I'm making you feel like you're doing things wrong
Don't fix yourself for me. I've already fixed myself so much for you
I'm mostly exaggerating it
I am me, no worries. And I like you (:. You matter, not the girlfriend stuff
Now I will be honest.. it could be nice.... but it's not what I care about. because I care about you (:
Well you being happy makes me the happiest. and I'm sorry if I ever make you think you're doing things wrong
Haha. We may start saying silly things. Time just flys because of you (:
Yeah. The silliest thing I could say could be like.. actually. I thought about it. and it would be the silliest and maybe the creepiest thing to say
sorry. sigh... the person sent me "Kiss the Girl"
never
I mean.. if that's what you want
Please don't ask. it sounds really creepy thinking about it
haha.. it involved marriage
I was going to jokingly say "Gonna have to wait until we're married". Which.. you have to admit. is kinda a creepy thing to say
It's a kind of creepy I was going to keep to myself. so that I wouldn't creep you out
What could be even creepier?
Oh, nah. I already said the creepiest thing. your creepy thing doesn't even compare
I'm sorry for bringing stuff up
Maybe
Keyword for what?
haha, awesome
You're cooler
but I thought you said I was "warm". sorry. kidding
haha. alright
haha. thanks
you're so amazing (:
haha, alright. and I'm sorry about.. stuffs I may have said
but yeah.. goodnight and sweet dreams
I will be looking forward to the "in-person" conversation :D. Goodnight, Leandra. I l<3ove you. (:
I L <3 ove you (:
Goodnight Leandra. Thanks for stabbing me with a dart yesterday (:. You make me so happy (:
You stabbed me with your heart
It's okay as long as it stays with me
Very. I love your heart. sorry 
haha. I want to hold onto yours forever. because I just. I love you. 
Well I'm sleepy. but it's not silly. I mean it (:
Yeah, I hope you sleep great (:. Like.. have the sweetest dreams . or.. have random silly dreams. either way.. sleep well :D. Thank you for being there for em. me*
They usually are when I dream of you
You're so perfect (:
It's crazy if I didn't think that. Because you really are. I'm super lucky (:. I loved talking to you :D Goodnight/morning
You're the bestest (:. Bye. I wrote a song :P. I think it's probably silly though
so silly. and you wrote one?. I start with Lyrics
I bet it will. I'd share you mine. but it's early. and everything is silly. but yeah.. night (:
haha. maybe. but I've kept you up so long already
If you want :P
Yeah, you too. I'll be there (:. When you're falling down. Even if you're aware. That you're falling in love. Falling so deep. Falling in love. Falling for me :P. sorry. falling looks weird :P
I like you too (:
it's cool. I knew what you were trying to do
Maybe. But unlike it. I'll try not to fail you :P
(:. That's reassuring. You're so awesome! (:
You truly are. You're perfect
nice way of combining that :P. you are too (:
Goodnight
so much math . :P
Goodnight, Leandra (:
haha.. it got difficult :P. Night. ttfn. sweet dreams. all that jazz, huh?. :P. I love you so, I hope you know. In my sleep your heart I'll keep. did not.. mean for that to rhyme. sorry, night
haha. good one (:
I was reluctant to say it for the same reason. But I mean it all the same (:. Bye :D
tah tah for now (:. I hope you're having a wonderful day (:
I'm not :P. I really like your profile picture, by the way. (:. Actually.. it got worse.. but oh well . (my day, not your picture). sorry. not like it matters :P
Oh my day. ?. :P. aww.. are you gone?
Oh.. . awesome!. I was disappointed for a moment
Yeah. I've been running on 3 hours of sleep the entire day
I went to a doctors appointment. and then mowed lawns until 6 ish. wait.. 6:40. But yeah.. nothing fun all day
You haven't
okay
oh, right. my bad. yeah you told me
it would take forever.. considering :p
maybe not. you may be on to something. anyway.. how was your day?
why so average?
that's nice. Sounds amazing!
I don't see how that's average
what could compare to it?. It sounds like you had the best day ever
Umm.. terrible. I got yelled at. Everyone was upset with me. I was just a real big disappointment. Pretty bad day. I mean... I guess it could have been worse. I also got hit in the eye with a stick. but it's whatever
Just everything I did was wrong. and yeah.. a stick got sucked into the lawn mower. and shot out and hit me in the eye
oh no.. mow the lawn on a low setting and it chokes the grass. and that's what I did..
I mean.. it makes the lawn look bad
it was my dad who got upset
I should have known what to do though. I thought I knew how to fix it but he just yelled at me
I was just a complete let down. and it started to rain
Well they shouldn't get upset at you. I think you're amazing. and if it matters at all I don't think I could be upset with you. But I'm a complete disappointment and waste of space. I mean.. I'm probably wasting your time right now :/
I kinda want to go outside and just.. walk. take a breather and what not. Right now I feel so.. :/
So what?. Oh.. no.. so worthless
nah. Not me at all. And I'd like to walk with you.. but you know :/
Someone like me comes a dime a dozen. and it's the lateness. I wouldn't want to ruin the end of your day either
A dime a million makes me even less unique. and I don't know what I'm doing tomorrow. also.. I doubt that
A dime a million would mean you could buy a million people for a dime
it's a saying. but I suppose I'm free
That's silly
My friends wanted me to go to the Salem fair with them. but I don't think they realized when it was. because they're all on vacation. but yeah.. I'm nothing special. I just ruin everything
nah.. I'm terrible at everything
I don't know if you can. umm.. okay. yeah. I suppose bye?
No like.. you went offline
right, I gotcha. I may go on that walk though
I'm really down in the dumps right now
nah.. I just feel like it's been an overall bad day
I did
Don't have a puppy. I think you could make it all better, but it's late. so I think I'll just walk and think about stuffs
haha, thank you. but I'm not sure how much that would help. If I get back.. I would still like to talk to you. maybe like.. tell you if I had an epiphany or something
if I return :P
I would prefer to stay and talk though
It could happen. You're cooler
that may make me.. worry a bit. but I don't know why. It's when you feed them after midnight. sorry... I suppose I'll talk to you later?. :/. sorry
You'll just find someone better and cooler and funnier to talk to while I'm gone. You'll just find someone better and cooler and funnier to talk to while I'm gone
yeah.. I kinda have to. I'd love to stay. sunlight.. by the way.. kills them
Umm.. I'm going on that walk
Not going to sleep
nah.. going in the dark
probably to die. :/. yeah.. bye. Talk to you later if you're still on. but I understand if you aren't
I'll*
Well.. if I do die. you know
I would want to
but yeah.. you'll have something to remember me by, I hope. Anyway.. bye. Goodnight if you're gone *if* I get back
Thanks for the thought... . but don't worry about me. bye
Hey. I.. kinda wanted to walk to your house
I have stuff on my chest that I would really like to say to you
and I'm not there. but I walked there
I turned back because I thought it could be an inconvenience . I can always go back
In a heartbeat actually
I know. it's like.. I feel impatient to tell you
I'm sorry. of course
but.. it's really like... This walk that I went on. Remember that "epiphany" part?. so like.. I want to tell you stuffs so bad. even if I just see you for a second
Yeah, kinda. so like.. I'm kinda tempted to run over to your house
I feel like it being in person would be better. I don't think you could convey it as well on the phone. it would lose it's meaning. Because I need to look you in the eyes and say it
Would you mind if like.. I dropped by?
I suppose that would be important . She'll probably say no though
I mean.. it's important. just I don't think she'd find it important
I'm sorry you forgot something
Well, I suppose that's what's important
Maybe I left me hat 
oh, okay
No, completely worth it. You're so worth it. I'll be there really quick
Oh, I'll be good. You don't have to go through the trouble. I'll see you really soon
Goodnight (:. And sweet dreams!
(:. You always make my day. I don't know if it works either. but we should keep at it!. because we're like.. not that far away
I think less than a mile
It is on
Anything now?
now?
it's Bill. I randomly got noise
I saw a light
Awesome (:
awesome. I should.. probably let you get some sleep though. so.. goodnight 
we can still attempt it if you want though
aww :/. :P. Okay. Later it is
Oh.. just wish I could do it now :D
anyway, goodnight, Leandra
Sweet dreams!. I think it will
I believe in it. ywa. yes*
right then
I believe in you (:. sorry. anyway, goodnight. sleep well
(:
You're amazing!. and perfect and just about everything :D. Goodnight (:
you are (:
thanks. Goodnight. I'll scan the radio until I reach your walkie talkie
okay.. I may wake up late. but I'll turn it on immediately. :D
I bet they do. Industrial kinds :P. haha, yeah. goodnight. see you tomorrow hopefully (:. Sweet dreams, you're the bestest and amazing. and you're like.. the sweetest dream (:
Bye (:
(:
and it's you :D. How are you?
Awesome :D
I don't really do it.. why do you ask?
Well in that case it shouldn't be too bad. like.. not too "stranger-y". What happens if we need to be outside for the walkie-talkies to work?
Awesome :D
oh, now?
That sounds a little silly :P. but okay
hold the button down for a while?. there
I got something
It scared me
fuzz
go for it (:
okay
haha, maybe
haha, I didn't even notice
thinking outside the box
haha, okay
what? :P
haha. :D. Well.. I should probably let you get to some important stuffs. Yeah.. bye I suppose
haha, alright. have fun :D. And I hope you have a fantastic day
oh? awesome :D
I'll try. and don't be sorry :P. nothing to be sorry for. anyway, have a great day :D
Thanks
like usual?. You sound amazing all the time (:. You're perfect (:
It is on
haha, okay
didn't work?
I guess not
sorry
I have nothing to get to.. but okay :D. Talk to you later, I hope. (: you're amazng . Bye (:. sorry.. :P
not really... I've got some stuff I can work on. but nothing important. but.. okay. bye again. sorry. :/
I was aware of that. :P. sorry :P
yeah :P
haha. You're really cool (:
no, you really are
You're amazing, I mean it
I don't see how it means more coming from me. but cool
(:. I really like you too . and I like your opinion 
that's the only crazy opinion
but you're perfect (:
oh, cool. Have fun!. (I wish I could see you later possibly) Bye (:. You're the most amazing person ever
How could that not be great?. Plus if it's her idea.. then she can't say no (:
sorry :P. but yeah (:
alright. I'm interested because I'd be able to see you. (:
I don't know how you'd have fun though :P. sorry
nah. you are (:. sorry. Oh yeah.. sorry.. you said you were going to go. so.. bye
Have a good day (:. I laheartove you. sorry.. bye (:
(:. Talk to you later, I hope. Hi (:
If you want :P. but I can always go :P
no thank you to the later?
you could have way more fun with me gone though :P
that's silly :P. Just me :P
not really :P. now.. you are, of course. but not me
I can't force you to take my word on it.. just know that's how I feel. and my day's been boring :P
Yeah, but it's whatever
I know. it can. but I don't think it will :P. how was your day?
Well if you have to get stuff done, don't let me be in the way
yeah, to talk to people :P. I get it :P. but you know.. if you have stuff to do. I'm not that important
what are you doing?
Is it a present for someone?
I believe in your paper mache skill
awesome!. is it like.. going to be a gift though?
awesome!
Means more when you make it yourself
Not in my case though... because I can't make anything good :P
That's all I can do :P
All of that stuffs is mediocre :P. but the thumb mitten. that I was proud of. ^_^
Whoa?
whoa.. I did?. and I suppose it does 
I don't know.. I saw the video and like.. toast. and you like toast. :D
I.. bet it'd be amazing. :P
brb. :/. I have to go 
I won't :/. sigh. oh well. I feel like my day just got ruined. bye
It's whatever..
It's nothing you did
I don't think you can. unfortunately. but yeah.. . I gotta go :/
no dinner what?
Oh.. well. I won't be back until 8. so.. that's kinda late
I don't know. I just asked when I'd be back
It won't be pleasant 
but yeah.. I hope I get home in time. and would you really want to?
That'd be cool. Well.. I'll let you know when I get back. bye bye for now
You're awesome. Talk to you later if your still on and willing to see me :P. and/or*
bye
If you really want me there :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. You're really really really amazing and perfect (:. Hello
Haha, you seem excited for something :P
I am alright. How are you?
That it does
I would be if you wanted me over :P
Yeah, same :P
haha :P. You should go for it 
fantastic! :D
I would.. I just feel like I'd have to get out of these slippers. :P
nah
I'm just like.. in my "pjs"
yeah :P. sorry
:P. I wouldn't want to be in the way also :p
Like.. I'd want to . But I don't know how fun it'd be for you :P
I bet very tasty bricks :D
why not?
!!
:D
No doubt. :P. I guess I should let you get to that?
Do you want me to come?. Because I do.. but you know. :P
Nah.. I've never made any before :P. How soon would you want me to get there?
I could probably get free in a little bit. Like.. 10 minutes give or take. but I'd also have to ask :P
Probably no one :D. So.. I'll be back in a few and let you know what I can do
awesome! :D. Bye for now (:
Okay. Hey. :P. Or.. alright :P
I was just about to leave :P
Because I didn't think you were still there. But yeah.. I can go :P
So.. when?
Sounds good. If I get there a little later, would that be okay?
We'll see :P. I'll see you soon (:
I think I can get a ride.. or at least ride my bike. See you (:. Bye
Neat :D
(:
I had so much fun (: thanks so much for inviting me! I don't know any other person I would have wanted to go with and I feel like I wouldn't have had as much fun with anyone else. You're amazing :D I'm sorry for being tired n' stuff.. :P but yeah, it was so amazing and so are you (: Everything was just perfect, even with the headache :D  Sweet dreams and everything, I hope I talk to you tomorrow too (: and thanks again! I really really really like you too, Leandra! (: (By the way, if you're wondering why I'm on this late.. it's because the air conditioning in my room is a little.. not there.. so my room is kinda unbearable at the moment. The air conditioning however works downstairs... so a couch sounds pretty good :D.. but yeah, goodnight (: you're amazing! :D). Hello (:
haha, that's good
Alright aside from sleeping on the couch. you?
I'm glad you like the cat . I should probably let you get to stuffs :P
Sound a little disappointed?. :P
Why?
sigh. Go for it. and have fun (:. Who am I anyway? :P
(: I love you too. I was just saying I can't be all crazy about the people you hang out with
yeah. :P
I believe you. (:
have fun with it . Whatever you do 
Nah.. I'm pretty much going to be stuck at home
You're hanging with that guy. so I'd just be in the way
Just in case for waht?. what*. I mean.. it's not bad. It's just not.. ya know :P
It's a nice way of not disappointing the guy. :P
haha, alright. I'll keep it on
awesome :D. I'll let you get to it then . have fun :D
are you seriously biking?. If so then good luck and be safe
Well I believe in you. Just don't hurt yourself. But most of all have fun (:. Bye (:
Yeah, hopefully. and you too! (:
Hi :D
I haven't gone biking yet . so you haven't missed it
I wouldn't think so. You wouldn't want to though, would you?
I would if you wanted
Alright. It's cool if you can't
!!!. :D. awesome. :P
Me too (:. We don't even have to bike, by the way. we could just walk or talk or something. walk along side our bikes :P
I bet you did :D
haha.. I thought you were just going to put your feet on :P
kidding (:. Yeah, meet where exactly though?
The trail?. My house?
Or should I meet you?
Okay.. my house it is then. (:. I can't wait to see you (:. I know.. I just saw you and I've seen you for the past few days.. but it's like.. more amazing every time
I'm not tired of you. I think the same thing though. that you're tired of me. But there's no way I could ever be . And, awesome.. see you soon (:
Totally :D
yay (:
okay, bye. I'm safe by the way.. if you're on/care :P
I found out.. when I got home. that.. I was bleeding. who knew?. Also almost got hit by a car that didn't see me/I didn't see it. but oh well
It's whatever
I had a lot of fun with you (:. I still feel like.. . yeah :P
I believe you n' all. I just don't feel assured :P. Because I'm pretty sure I messed up a lot today
Well, I'm sorry about that. I'm glad you're okay though. I'm itchy :/. A lot of that.. sticker grass?. :P. Sorry :P
It's okay. I should probably let you get to something important
Still more important than me
And that's cool. I probably couldn't make the picking any more fun. And yeah.. I should just let you sleep n' stuff
nah. It's just me
Yeah.. haunted
I was kinda scared. Because I couldn't move when i did. Like.. no joke
but.. I guess I'm okay. It's whatever. if anything happens it's just me
I'm just one person. I don't mean much :P
You could always find someone better :P
Well.. that's very reassuring. and nice. and.. butterfly-y. (:. Sorry.... You're the bestest (:. and.. I love you. (:
Oh I was just on :P. I wasn't going anywhere. But have fun (:
Yeah, more fun with you of course (:. anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams. I hope you have fun tomorrow in whatever you do
Yeah! . A day I don't have anything to do :/. but I'll.. find something I suppose. Anyway, bye . (still feel like a mess up :P)
You're perfect. But I'm not. And I always get hurt at the pool :P
Drowning?. Someone hits you with something?
I can't :P. I can doggy paddle
nah. :P
Awesome :D. that'd be cool. but I feel like I'm wasting your time
somehow it is :P. I love talking to you (:
I'm glad you like it
That.. is awesome
that's really really cool
That's important!. Why'd you let me waste your time?
Well I'm not that important. You should have just forgot about me. But.. have fun with that! (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams
it doesn't.. . but thanks. I won't forget you either. but that's not quite what I meant by it. I'm so glad I've got you (:. sorry 
I'm glad too (;. (: *. but I meant.. don't worry about me and just eat. You know.. n' stuff
Why worry about me?. :P. sorry. anyway.. I'll try to stay safe just for you :D. goodnight (:
I wouldn't want that for you either. I just want you to be as happy as possible (: I love your smile, it's the best :D. Night (:. Have fun n' stuff
I love you too, Leandra. (:. It's okay (:
Okay, goodnight (:. sweet dreams. and I'm really glad you like the sushi cat. I was kinda afraid that you would have thought it was bad
You're really amazing and nice (:
sorry :P. But yeah, night (:. - you make my heart beat faster. sorry again. bye. (:
I love your smile (:. You make me smile too
(:. You too!. Hello
sorry :P. I always feel like you'll get tired of me.. so like.. I was afraid to say hi.... but umm.. how are you?
I'm okay I guess. But I suppose you probably have something to get to
Yeah. Sounds important though. I'll leave you to it
I'm up to nothing really. Mostly worrying myself too much
Phew.. now I'm not worried at all
maybe it's not :P. but what does it matter?. It's just silly things
It normally is silly things. :p
haha. well.. just. if you do happen to get tired of me.. all I'll have would be a shoe box of memories :P
I wouldn't think it would be. but I literally have a shoebox.. with stuff that makes me think of you. which.. is silly, I know. but still
Well.. okay. But like.. I don't know. I was listening to this song. Called Stand Too Close
Yeah.. and that's what made me think of it. "I'm great at first, but then the magic fades"
and I really don't see what's so great about me in the first place
So like.. good morals? or something :P
Well I just thought that's how you were supposed to be. Kind to people and try your hardest to make people smile. and avoid bad stuffs :P
I guess I've never really considered that
Because I'm not really trying :P. and I didn't know that
haha. You may need gloves or something. or dare someone to drink it o.O. except.. don't do that. they could get really sick :P
yeah :P. I think.. you may know me better than I know myself :P
I guess finding out is part of the adventure :P. but yeah, I feel like out of everyone I know. You know me the best
Thanks. I feel like I've only uncovered the top of the mystery though. :P
No, you're the mystery :P. I'd like to say I know you really well. but I still feel like I've only read the first few chapters :P
haha, yeah. that and like.. a little bit about each one
So.. that part about having a good sense of right and wrong.. . I'd say you have that too. but like.. before in my head I didn't word it that way. sorry.. a little off subject. :P
Whoa.. I'm only missing 2 :P
If it's any consolation. my wisdom teeth are going to have to be taken out at some point
Lucky :P
whoa. that's crazy
I still find the thought of myself being perfect crazy too. Maybe I can listen to it and find out?
neat. I've never even heard of the band that sings it
Yeah, I guess :P
You're so cool (: 
seriously, I don't know why you'd be talking to me
is that what's funny?. Because you're right. not that funny :P
so?
so what was the funny thing?
maybe :P. I don't really know what I'm looking for
It doesn't seem so sunny where I'm standing :P
kinda :P
Giving birth to yourself?
I don't think so
yeah
haha.. that seems a bit random :P. I like the extra happy smiley though. :P. sorry
haha, yeah
You kinda do. You might just not know about it
yeah, that one
I mean.. it's kinda close. ish
I would if I could drive
I wish I knew where my brothers one was. so that I could let you borrow it. it may be different from what you mean. but it's like a portable sort of thing
Anyway.. you sound busy.. I should probably let you get to whatever it is you're doing
Sounds like.. Prince of Belaire, but you replaced school with pool :P. but yeah.. have fun with your stuffs
Wait.. are you asking me that?
is it?. sounds like clarinet mixed with bass
oh well. can still dream :P. I guess I should let you be goin'
Do you have a normal saw?. I'm kinda curious as to what you're doing :P . I'm also lost on a lot of things. but.. sorry. I'll just say bye. I've wasted enough of your time. I'll just get back to my worrying n' all
I couldn't help out with a key hanger :P. I'd probably break it.. I'm bad with that sort of stuff. and.. maybe I am
but it's okay
I was kidding.. about being bad with that sort of stuff. but still. and maybe.. still
I still couldn't help much though :P
the what?
Who's to judge musical taste anyway?
I'm sorry though. that I don't. I'm sorry for everything too
Nah, I'm not. and I should stop taking up your time. so.. bye
I know, that's why I'll just go . You shouldn't be worrying about me. I'm just a waste of time. and everything
I like that too.. but today I don't know. "somedays the clouds don't seem to stay away"
crazy, me too :P
yeah :P. but.. yeah.. have a good day and everything
Fun stuffs for who?. You?
Well, you can have fun n' stuffs. as you do fun stuffs. Yeah, have fun. bye
I will worry :P
Pretty much everything I shouldn't worry about. but I worry about it anyway. I mean.. I've got nothing else to do today. :P
to be honest, I don't even want to say bye.. but I feel like I'm in your way... yeah..
I ran out of paper mache
I heard flower sometimes goes in it. but, nah. I feel like I'll just continue on with what I'm doing. so.. yeah, bye I guess
right
okay?
sigh, alright. :P
sure?. http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://xponandzix.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/butterflies.jpg%3Fw%3D188%26h%3D300&imgrefurl=http://xponandzix.wordpress.com/&usg=__RyNCuSzuEbyQcmJ29TPKcPtS-Aw=&h=299&w=188&sz=40&hl=en&start=0&zoom=1&tbnid=2IWZ5Tm-VO0tMM:&tbnh=144&tbnw=91&ei=DoUPTpK-CeL10gHw_dCfDg&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dthis%2Bis%2Bhow%2Byou%2Bmake%2Bmy%2Btummy%2Bfeel%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dsafari%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Den%26biw%3D1025%26bih%3D1001%26tbm%3Disch&um=1&itbs=1&iact=hc&vpx=334&vpy=473&dur=1078&hovh=239&hovw=150&tx=106&ty=137&page=1&ndsp=32&ved=1t:429,r:16,s:0. sorry
yeah. So.. you're going to a hardware store?. I hope you have fun
I would. but I'm not that good. plus I couldn't make that any fun. You should ask someone fun to play with you
I think you're confused with someone else. I'm just some guy who worries too much. no fun here
nope. I should just.. get on my bike and disappear. Like that one guy who lost his bike in the water
Well who knows?. Either way I should just disappear. haha, not that you care. but yeah.. I think that's what I'll do
sorry?
Well you don't need to
especially if I'm just going to "disappear"
It'd be good for everyone
You should. and I should go set forth on my "dastardly" plan
nah.. I'm just thinking about disappearing for a few days. because at the moment.. I don't feel so great
I mean.. right now I feel pretty.. worthless. so.... I guess not
I kinda do. and I don't know. I probably shouldn't
Did you watch it?
crazy. I feel like such a bother
I trust you. I just.. I'm stuck this way I guess
yeah... You said you needed to go, right?. I should probaby stop keeping you then
See.. that sounds like fun
but playing catch with some droopy daisy?. no.. that's not fun
Is that song supposed to help?
Well. it surprisingly does. doesn't*
aw :(?
It's cool. I shouldn't. Just do I guess. I got new bed sheets.. I guess I wasn't ready for that dramatic change you know?
Grey. and nothingness
My old ones had Mickey Mouse
you can see how that could affect something
New new ones?. I don't think that could float. but grey and bland.. match me perfectly
nah. I should probably start being happier though. I just don't really know how
you've seen me for how many days now?. You can't tell me you're not tired yet. and I've seen that (:
I really don't see how. at the very least your mom or sister would be tired of me :P
so your sister is?
Oh!. no sister as in.. she's not there. sorry. I was reading it as no sister as in no, my sister is
Just thought you forgot it :P. but it's my bad
All these little things.. I just mess up all the time. eventually it's going to get worse and worse
I guess you're right. thanks. I guess that makes me feel a little better
I kinda feel like I was a bother though. maybe.. feel like that less now. but before.. 
Like.. I don't know. Just.. I shouldn't have been worrying. and I shouldn't have troubled you with what was bothering me
no gravy?. just kidding
bye then
have fun. and have a good rest of your day
Do you want to?
haha, I don't know why :P
I can only agree the first thing in the list. to the*
only the first. the second is lame
I would. But it sounds to me that you've already planned today out. And I don't really need to be in the plan :P
How could I make your day any better?
Well.. okay
I want to. You sure you haven't seen me enough already?
Well.. I still think it's impossible. but okay. If you want to. Well.. I'm free whenever
Yeah. good point
why the frowny face? can't be that disappointing. For you anyway :P. sorry.. I suppose you're practicing. I can.. leave you to it :P
Good idea. Good luck,
still haven't folded those?
I suppose that would pose a problem. Have fun with that
Yeah, and you know.. I can just pretend I wasn't excited about it
Of course. I'll just make sure I don't disappear for too long
I don't know where I'm headed. anywhere I suppose. away from everyone
It's probably lonely. and no.. no plans
not even hand and hand. I'll probably just stay home
we could. but you have other people you'd want to do something with, I'm sure
Well, there's a first time for everything
and you could spend the time with loved ones as you do it
I don't deserve that kind of title. plus I'm sure there are people who miss you and want to spend time with you
nah. everyone who could are out of town. Yeah, not many miss me. or would want to spend time with me
You miss me? You just saw me yesterday. and that's really neat
I'm not going to lie.. I felt the same way
but.. you know.. I pretended not to be affected. just because I thought it'd be silly. and that you wouldn't care :P. sorry
Yeah, it is . it's probably why I feel sad at times. I'm listening to Keane on youtube. some of the songs are sad 
yeah.. but it's okay right?. Pretending to be happy is just as good too :D
I.. don't know
it's okay
Is that sad?
sorry for what?
I didn't know I'd be finding out now I was torn from you; when we thought about things we were gonna do. We were wide eyed dreamers and wiser too
That's not even the sad one :P. sorry
I should just shut up :P
I'm feeling down, and I don't even know why. Well.. I might know why. but.. still. I'm sorry
I dunno
eh. not a good reason. and I don't want to make things worse
well.. I don't know
what?
yeah, but it's okay
It's okay. thank you.. for trying
It means the world. at least you care to try
I don't know.. I suppose it's pretty easy to do
nah
I'd say.. you make me smile a lot, but I guess I miss your smile or something. I'm sorry, I'm lame
yeah, I guess. It's really silly . but umm.. you said you had until 8. so.. I don't know what's going on, but I guess I should just let you get goin'
Tennis?. That's awesome. Someone threw the racket at me the last time I played tennis.. so I haven't played since. but if you gotta do stuff, go do it. It's more important anyway. okay.. well.. bye then
did I fail then?. sigh... racquet, sorry. but they got upset and just threw it. I'm just.. going to go
wither away
they were upset and intentionally threw it at me. but it doesn't matter. I don't even matter.. so I'll wither like I said before
I'm awful at tennis. I don't remember it in detail. but I guess I did something wrong. and nothing's wrong. I'm just terrible
I am, but it's okay
I think I am. Every time I see your face my heart goes into a high speed chace. chase*. sorry... Yeah, I'll just go :/
You had to go at 8 anyway. so.. bye
Yeah, that's important. so get to it :P
Alright. have fun. (:. Bye :/. sorry. but yeah . talk to you some other time. if you want
awesome
I bet
It's actually the number to.. something. I forgot about it
it has something to do with baseball
yeah.. it just means everything
yeah. I guess I meant it's just everything important or something
Douglas
Yeah. and it sounds fun. but I wouldn't be that fun. plus.. you're going tomorrow.. so like.. that should be way more fun n' everything
nah.. I bet it wouldn't feel any different playing with me. I mean.. it's the same game either way
not really... Well I mean.. depending how good they are. but I'm really bad
maybe
no, with me being worse
We will indeed
I wrote a song today.. but I didn't like it
so I erased it
I've heard of that guy
it was nothing cool
not at all
nope
not really. I. I'm just some guy*. but thanks for the thought
yeah... it hurts
kidding :P
that would be a nice invention. useless to most people. but nice
yeah
you did that?
that's good
:/. haha, yeah.. so good :D
nah
yeah... anyway.. you seem busy n' all. And after all, I'm just some guy
yeah. be it from me to keep you from that. or anything else you may be up to. plus you probably have so many people talking to you.. if you take me from the equation you have to give less responces
I'm just one person. not even a good one person
well.. you've gotta have something better to do with your time
yeah, see?. There you go. something better than me
it's okay. it's good to know I'm a little above Mountain Dew
I.. seriously feel like a bother. I'm just arguing with you n' all
Umm okay then. so.. we agree then?
We weren't really arguing
I was just.. shutting down everything you said positive about me. I've eaten chocolate and graham crackers seperately. so if I ate some marshmallows.. it'd be like.. I ate a smore :P
I don't feel that way today I suppose
maybe.. some point. sounds like a farewell though :P
are you saying goodbye?. I'll take the long pause as a yes
sigh, haha. alright. bye then. goodnight and sweet dreams. have fun tomorrow
Don't miss me.. it's just me. I have an excuse to miss you though. so.. yeah. bye
That was my excuse. I guess I have to find another one
I wish I didn't have to go feeling this way, but okay. and it's okay. I like you sooo much.. like so much that you can just have my excuse. I'm sure I can come up with another one. like.. you being amazing n' all
Don't worry about it. just go to bed. (:
I feel.. a little sad. but trust me, it's okay, okay? (:
Just promise me you'll sleep well
I'll feel better if I don't keep you awake any longer. You've got important stuff in the morning
And it's fine for me too. I'll live, no worries. I'll be okay, just sleep really well (:. I care more about you than myself, so just do that for me?
Don't blame yourself either, because it's never your fault
You're perfect (:. and thank you for caring. even when you don't have to. I really really really like you, Leandra. You're amazing. Goodnight (P. (: *
haha. I love how you can make me smile even when I'm feeling down :P. sorry... Anywho.. bye bye
I like yours way more (:. sorry. goodnight (:
I'm open to it. just like.. I don't really know
I mean.. to you maybe :P. sorry. I'll be okay though. it's nothing major
I'm the bad guy
really?. What make syou say that?. makes you*
I want to be the good guy. but I don't think I deserve it
I wouldn't think I deserved much. anyway.. I should just leave :P. sorry
I don't know. I'm just me :P. that's why
You're right.. it is. but it's what I've got. I wish I could say I deserved you.. but that's not fair
better than you is impossible when you're so perfect. I love everything about you (:
I'm sorry if it means less over facebook. but I mean it with all my heart
You should. sorry for keeping you. up*. I'm also sorry for the lack of symmetry in the sushi cat
Well.. I'm still sorry. it's not perfect. I wish it was. but I can't do anything right
that sounds.. terrible
but mostly terrible. :/
And nah.. I can't do everything right
not really
I wish I was as perfect as you thought. because maybe then I'd deserve you n' all
Well.. okay. I kinda maybe don't know . but alright. yeah, goodnight n' stuff
Aww.. I missed them :/. and I'll miss you . Sweet dreams 
and I...
yeah. okay (:
I'll do it anyway. you're so much to miss :P. bye (:
but.. . never mind :P. yeah, bye (:. (I still will). sorry
That's so far away. Like.. sorry for this.. but I prefer being by your side
yeah (:. sigh, haha. goodnight (:
not a bad sigh by the way :P. but yeah, Sweet dreams (:
Yeah, sorry.. not a good time :P. Night. Have fun tomorrow (:
not now it isn't :P. I'll tell you some other time. bye bye
It would mean so much more in person though 
I was going to hide out in a hole on the fourth :P. I'll see ya, Leandra (:. Goodnight
Especially those :D. Awesome!. Have a fantastic time! :D
Thanks :P. bye
oh I thought you disappeared without saying goodbye :P
It's okay if you did :P. But okay, bye bye, goodnight (:
sorry :/. but I wasn't home. unfortunately. but I'm sorry
It wasn't a bad time.. I just got.. a little hurt
I'm better :P. So.. what did you happen to want that made you want to call?. (I called back.. but it sent me straight to voice mail)
Aw.. I missed out, huh? :/
Aw :/
I wish I was home earlier :/
nah.. I just.. lost my breath for a little while. I'm good now though
I was on a swing earlier. :P
:/. My stuff didn't send. but.. oh well. no.. I just kinda tripped
alone of course
yeah, it's nothing really... Man.. I missed out on being able to see you today :/. And I mean.. seeing me is pretty average. but seeing you? 
aww.. :?. :/*
There.. my stuff sent
sigh... I wish I were home earlier. instead I was laying down. I mean.. I still would have come home late. but.. :/. sorry. and since it is so late.. you're probably headed to bed anyway.. so.. I guess I missed out
Like.. it's not that bad. I was just.. running. I'm okay now
22?
I may have forgotten some stuff though :P. But.. anyway.. I suppose it's late
I am I'm afraid
Yeah, unfortunately. Any other plans I've made, if I made them.. I forgot
Sure?
sounded excited for a moment
Nah. I just didn't know why you would be
I must have forgotten about that too..
If you have to ask that question... then it must be a certainty. Or at least you must feel that way
Could be bad as in how?. Too attached or something?
Well you shouldn't be scared of me getting tired of it
but if you want to spend time with friends then you know. I'm not as important
I meant like... I don't know. If you feel like we're spending too much time with each other and you want to spend your time with your friends then go for it. I'm just some guy after all
thanks for what?
haha, I have silly worries too. I can't really say much though.. because all my friends are out of town. but yeah.. I hear that too. I guess I don't worry about it because it doesn't seem so.. out there. and there's way too much stuff to worry about :P
Why worry?. Because I'm just some guy who isn't that great. and no matter how many times someone tries to tell me different I never really feel like it's different
You really help. but I have a hard time believing it. and there isn't really much proof :P
I suppose just your smile is enough
(:. amazing proof too. but I still doubt myself at times :P
yeah.. but that just sounds like the thing you're supposed to say
alright. I shouldn't have left home today. not going to lie.. it left me worrying about more stuff
I don't know. stuff I don't want to bore you with
nah, it's okay. I'm sorry, by the way.. that you worry about spending too much time with me.. because if you worry about it then it might just be the case. I don't even have to be around if you don't want
Yeah, but it would give you less to worry about
well... worrying is probably what I do best
I've heard about that. My friend that moved told me that
yeah. I worry about you getting tired of me.. and never wanting to see me again
the until it happens scared me
Yeah... I guess I'm worrying over what is in store or what could happen
That's what I'm worried about, haha
Exactly
Yeah.. I dunno.. I guess I just don't think I'm so great. and that you'll realize that eventually
Well thanks. that means a lot. I guess I shouldn't have been hanging out with my depressed friend... They told me "Everyone you're ever going to love is just there to use you and break your heart". Don't get me wrong though. If I had any say in the matter I would much prefer my heart broken
I don't know... It would mean my heart would get broken
I was thinking that. and like.. I don't know if that could work. I guess that's when they've got it right and they just marry each other
So you're implying you'll break my heart?
Uh oh..
Awesome :D. I feel.. better. even though that was a joke
haha, somehow. either way.. I feel a lot better. and.. safer (:. Thank you
You're so awesome.. er :D
Aw (: You're the bestest bestest-friend I could ever ask for
no.. . because you still take my breath away. sorry..... I guess the other thing I typed never sent. I like how that keeps happening :P. anyway, goodnight (:
No.. I like how what I send never actually sends
Well last night I saw a type bubble from you :P. and.. nothing :P
who knows?. Oh well. what I "sent" doesn't matter anyway. so.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:
I was just saying that you make me really happy. and I'm glad that you're there
and other stuff.. that you probably don't need to hear
Well... I don't know if you'd want to hear it. like.. once it's out there.. there's no taking it back
Well.. it's just... I really really really like you.. and.. other stuff. sorry
There was a maybe in there?. sorry. I'll just let you get to sleep
oh... okay..
sorry.. I wasn't aware. that would make sense though. I feel.. stupid now. I guess I'll just go then
Nah, it was good. It's my bad for not catching it. You're perfect (:
nah. I hope when you find the bestest that you hold on to 'em an' never let go :P.  But.. I'm not that great. anyway, sleep well and goodnight
  But I'm not as awesome as the bestest :P.                                  and they're out there :P.              and I forgot to wish.. as I typed that
sorry. unintentional
out where?. I mean.. I'm right here. where I'm supposed to be
and my greatest wish already came true.. so new ones aren't so grand
it's okay, I kinda forgot what lead to the question. but yeah, thank you for coming true (:. sorry.. for that sounding lame
You're a wish, a dream or just a fantasy . You're altogether unreal. but I'm glad you are (:. sorry.. lame sounding again. sorry.. goodnight, Leandra. (:. Sweet dreams!
The a/c is kinda working.. but it's still not great :P. I l <3 ove you..                                         I l <3 ve you.*.                     (:. sorry, bye (. (:*
sorry        
still.. sorry. Someone told me they use ":P" when they get annoyed with someone. so.. yeah. bye 
Yeah.. so you were just joking. cool. good to know
It's eyes look sad though.. when you look at it long enough
well I'm sorry. I probably should say less
Well.. okay (:. I'll just.. save "meaningful" stuffs for like.. when I'm with you or something. anyway.. goodnight (:. sorry for keeping you for so long
I wish I could keep you forever
but I meant about keeping you awake
and meaningful as.. more meaningful. but I mean.. if it all is. then I should be with you a lot more... but I'm not sure how you'd like that
haha, alright. :D. Well, sorry again. but okay, goodnight n' sweet dreams
           Are there some?   . I wasn't aware :P. but uh.. yeah (:. You're amazing 
Bye (:
that it is
Wasting electricity, hmm?. Kidding.. anyway, I hope you're having a good day
I see . Oh, well, yeah. I hope you have a great day. But as of now.. I hope it's pretty good :P
haha.. I don't see how that helps with fireworks. but okay
it's fine
haha.. just practice for the future
you should go for it, haha. I believe in you :D
Well I'll just be your lucky charm.. or something. although.. I may not be the best :P
Well, I'll try my best
haha :P. well, thanks. I'll always try my best for you.. 
Well, I still do. Just incase . I have the hiccups :/
okay?. Done. and.. 
Surprisingly.. it works :P
Thank you
Well.. I'm thanking you anyways :D
I was about to suggest that :P
Of course :D
You're cooler. bye (:
Have fun n' whatnot 
That would be awesome :D. It's okay if not though :P
I hope so too, bye :D
Oh no.. it's just going to cancel everything
I would
I can be. I have some stuff I've gotta finish up around here. but it should be quick
Alright, awesome. I'll let you know when I get done (:. I'll talk to you later
Bye, and thank you. psst... I'm done, by the way. :P
Hello
Who said that?
Is that what I am to you?
Nah, that's silly :P
That's even sillier :P. The lightning.. and the thunder is like.. natural fireworks. even nature is celebrating today :D
Yeah! :D
Awesome :D. So will you
I meant you'd look cute like always
haha (:
okay, neat
Oh, right. when you said "ohhhh" that's what I realized :P. I guess some other time then
Most likely. I hope you enjoy your holiday nonetheless 
I was.. not going to lie. say that "it's cool.. I could just watch a movie or play Tony Hawk"
haha, of course
It's probably not as fun as it seems
if you say so :P
Okay?. sorry :P
Oh, of course. well.. I've got the game nearby . but I don't know what you're suggesting
I did not know of the parade. and I'd be up to playing. but I don't know. :P
Yeah. I was kinda wondering why there were so many firetrucks driving by
I guess... I suppose I should go find something to do . I'm sure you've got your hands ful
Well, you didn't quite make it too clear. the topic also changed.. so... yeah. I didn't know, I'm sorry
It's okay. I'm not either
No... I'd love to :D
sorry
Umm.. okay. awesome. See you soon then. ?*
(practice driving in the rain?). I am ready whenever and right now even :P
haha, awesome. I'll go turn it on. I'll see you soon (:
haha.. awesome. 15 :P. sorry, bye :D
well it was fine, no worries n' all that . I hope you sleep well! Goodnight, Leandra. (:. (I'm sorry you were so tired, I probably should have left sooner)
I'm sorry that you do.. it's a shame.. but either way, sweet dreams (:
haha, sorry :P Bye (: I hope you have a good morning and a great day tomorrow :D
Or really gloomy and depressing.. and cloudy
haha, I thought you were tired.. I would have thought you would have crashed (in bed of course.. asleep, not the car) :P
But.. I hope that it's okay too and I'm glad you're safe (: Goodnight (:
See it was only one meaning.. but then you sent the whole car thing.. and boom, a whole new meaning o.o anyway, I hope you have a good day (:
you too! (:. You're amazing, by the way (:
Not quite, but thanks
haha, well if you say so.. but I'd say you're way more amazing than I :D
Well you shouldn't, you're the most amazing person I've ever met. And I guess.. it's a nice day?. you?
I'm sorry, but it's great that it's been alright (:
Yeah.. all I've done today was go to an eye appointment.. so it's been pretty boring, but that's okay
It's stayed the same.. so that's still okay. and I guess there's still time in the day.. but I don't know what I'd do, but I'm cool with a boring day
I'd want to.. but I can't shake the feeling that you could be tired of me by now :P
I'd say it's pretty plausible . Like.. I think it was tested on mythbusters..
haha. anyway, how have you been?
I've been alright. and it wasn't a no. it was just a.. I don't wanna bother you
Always until eight :P
haha. :P
I'd like to. I haven't gotten any better though
Lemme go see
I can. Now the question is.. can you?
Yeah. See you soon then (:
haha, okay. me too. bye (:
See ya :D
haha, definitely.  :D
haha, definitely that
One of these days we should find out. Unless of course you want to find out with someone else. then that's cool doo. too*
:D. so much fun. aw, you're so much fun! :D
Well I couldn't either, you're so amazing (:
thanks. Being something is pretty alright . I suppose :P. but no, you're so amazing (:. I don't see how you don't see that. but I guess that just makes you even more amazing
Me too. But seriously.. you're awesome
Me.. too. :D
haha, so much fun (:
Does that say "if I were you"?
so it's "And I you". ?
oh. right. okay. so.. I should go everywhere and it would be great?. losing me little by little :P
No doubt one day :D . You're amazing and can do like.. everything perfect :D
I'm sorry... I don't know why you find that crazy though
oh, have fun then
I feel the same way (:
yeah, I'd be sad if you didn't think that way :P. what were you trying to say?. but it'd only be you coming to your senses
Well.. still. it could happen
alright. I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting
Well, I still dunno :P. forever is a long time
haha
Goodnight, sweet dreams (for whenever you go to sleep). You're amazing, and the bestest (:. I just hope you know that
You're perfect (: and I'm extremely lucky . Bye (:
You too (:. haha, you're the greatest dream :P. sorry..
I hope you're okay. Either way, I believe in you; you're brave! (:. And I hope you sleep well regardless of your "run-in". Goodnight :D
Aw.. you got up.. *so* early. so I guess I missed out
well you know.. because it was really early :P. but aw.. I wish I got up that early to go running :/
Well.. okay.. :P. But now I probably should go running, alone :P
You already ran.. it'd be silly to run again
well.. okay :P if you want to. umm.. bye I guess
Thanks. Being alone won't be so bad I guess... but yeah, I hope you have a great day n' whatnot. Bye
Right.. well.. I kind of gave up due to it being very.. disappointing. But uh.. okay, have fun with your lunch stuffs
Crazy, only you :P. just kidding, but that's awesome!. I hope you're having a wonderful day :D
I'm really glad you're alive! I wasn't aware of a meeting though :P but I hope you had fun at least :D. I just noticed the "or something" that's a bit discerning.. and I recall that you were planning on blueberry picking tomorrow, so I hope you have a lot of fun with that :D anyway, I hope you had a great day, goodnight and sweet dreams (:
You're welcome. I didn't know you were canoeing :P. That's really exciting. Anyway, have a great day. Sounds to me that your summer is crazy amazing.. jampacked with awesome :D. haha, sorry.. . I'm going to try that.. "disappearing" thing out today.. but I still hope you have a wonderful day! . Also hope the rain doesn't interfere with any blueberry festivities :P
Well.. have fun.... Sorry, I feel like a bother.. I guess I didn't do a very good job at disappearing... but tomorrow for sure
I'll just disappear for a few days.. you know.. nothing major :P I hope you sleep well as well, goodnight and sweet dreams! (I don't know why I would own anything to the sort.. I may have a cowbell though..)
Umm.. no.. just disappearing. and hi
Umm.. no. disappear somewhere random. alone
I was thinking out in some gazebo on some trail
yeah :P
sure I can
of course
Yeah. me all the way :P
good point.... I'm no pro
nah. I'm lame
nah
When is that?
haha, okay. that makes sense as to why you asked what you did :P
I don't know.. maybe?
yeah. it sure prepared me :P
Anyways. you're probably tired.. so I should probably just let you sleep
nah.. I'm not tired at all. I was just assuming that you've done so much today. And I'd just bore you to sleep either way :P
You probably could have gone your entire day without talking to me. Couldn't hear it.. but maybe they were very enthusiastic about it
It would have been a great day!. I mean.. without me?
Best day of your life . or that :P
What does last summer have to do with anything?
Well.. maybe in comparison it wasn't amazing. but today.. I bet 
I bet. see?. Fantastic day for you! 
Regardless of what?. I mean.. it was great in the most sarcastic of ways
Oh.. I'm just.. really sore. it's boring, so you don't have to hear about it
I did lawn stuff.. all day. I moved sticks, mowed lawns, weeded
yeah, all day
bugs everywhere.. 
I got hit by a huge branch. a rock shot out and hit me in the face
I hit my shin on the wheel barrow. But it's whatever..
right.. yeah
Umm... no. now I'm just sore. and tired
It's whatever though.. just a bad day
The people who own the place don't care. And I was told I did a poor job anyways
It's the back yard.. cut once a year. no one notices it. I got cut by some limbs and.. it's whatever. not like it matters anyway
nah.. I'm just a waste of space
Who cares if I'm around anyway? I'll just disappear :P
I guess not
It's nothing. I just feel like disappearing would be beneficial for everyone. It's not like I matter that much anyway
You sound so.. forced
I want to disappear mostly because no one would care. and yeah.. you sound like you're making everything sound so meaningful
Yeah.. well.. the "formalness" is what's doing it. also the large page-like messages
Nah, you just say that
I don't know if you mean it like you do
well you could just be saying that too
who knows.. maybe everything you've told me was just to make me a little happier. exactly
I suppose.. but I'm just.. I'm stupid, okay?
I'm just feeling down.. and I don't know what I'm thinking
Only your world. maybe.... I'm just some boy after all.. I can't affect that many people
Yeah.. and I suppose it didn't help that much
I don't have that many cow-ish things
I'd like to.. but I don't know if it wouldn't be just you
Really?. I didn't know that
Wouldn't there be someone else you'd want to go with you?
Well I mean.. I'm just me. so.. I'm not that great
I really don't know what I am to you.. but thanks. I think you're pretty perfect too. my head still hurts from that tree branch
just eyes :P. well.. anything like.. I don't know how it works. and it's nice hearing that stuff.. but I guess I'm still pretty down
umm.. no. It's whatever
It's okay, really. I'll be fine
it means.. something. but you should have just left me alone in the start. because now you've got my heart. sorry.. bad time....... anyway.. I'll be fine. you don't have to worry about me
I know.. it wasn't really meant to
nah.. it was lame. I'm lame..
that it was lame?. but it was..
how am I not though?. sorry.. don't answer that. you should probably just get to bed
right.. well. I guess I should just.. break a leg, huh?. I'm really not that great though. Just feel like some guy.. ya know?
Phew. Glad we got that out of the way
everything :P. that I'm really great and not just some guy. I don't know what that makes me though
I wouldn't say that makes you that lucky. anyway.. are you sleepy?
I don't have to be in the way. You can go to bed if you want. sleep is important
It doesn't.. I don't see how you could need me though :P
You must be *so* tired :P 
I don't know what you're saying :P. but I think you want to go to sleep :P.     We can always talk tomorrow or something
I don't know how I am... how are you?. plus.. you're not missing out on much by going to bed now :P
I feel.. empty :P. and nah.. just dream of me and you wouldn't miss out on a thing. although.. that sounds a bit.. creepy
better.. than the real thing. I'm empty of.. I don't know. that's just how I feel. It doesn't really matter
    I don't know if you can or not
Statefarm. It's really comforting knowing that though. I guess I needed someone to talk to.. but you were too busy. and it can't really be fixed over facebook :P
Too busy today :P
not really. but I can always go
yeah        . I guess :P. but umm.. goodnight I guess. sleep well and sweet dreams
yeah, you too. I hope I could see you. but that would like.. ruin your day. anyway, bye
Goodnight
Yeah?
Oh, haha, okay. Hi and goodnight
You're amazing.. But I really should let you sleep
You need sleep. I think you're perfect (:. so yeah, goodnight and sweet dreams. sorry. You're probably just waiting for me to leave :P
I meant that in a "Oh, finally he's gone" sort of thing
Why would anyone want to keep me around?. and what's too good to be true?
 Well you better believe it.. because it's absolutely true 
I didn't want to say this.. but you fell asleep 30 minutes ago. just kidding. you're dreams are "too random" for something this constant
see?. You're not dreaming :P. and if you were.. it wouldn't be that great of a dream. I mean.. it's got me in it. at any rate.. I really do like you. However, i should probably let you get some sleep.. so goodnight and sweet dreams
It's not just crazy talk. I completely mean it
dramatic :P
but you may be on to something there :P. I trust you on it though. but.. sleep well. I'll actually get off so that you can actually get some sleep. Bye (:
sorry.. umm.. bye even more perfect person.. Girlfriend, is it?. sorry.. about that :P anyway, I hope you have an amazing day :D
I don't know.. just. Yeah :P. sorry :P. Good morning :D. umm.. okay then, bye
sorry for what?. It's okay to miss someone :P. I miss you too. but like.. it hasn't been so long, has it?. Well.. bye for now I suppose :P. Have a fantastic day
Well.. I wish there was something I could do about it. anyways, have a good morning n' what not, I suppose I should be leaving
I'm not..  . I have to mow again today. so.. crummy start to the day, but who knows.. you may 'randomly' run into me later :P. Bye, I'll talk to you later hopefully
after the lawn stuff.. I think so. I'll figure it out, but I gotta go before my dad yells at me.      Have a great day regardless!. With your cow stuffs :P.   ttfn
Well.. I'd want to do it with you of course :P. If I can. Buh bye. I'm back.. by the way.. not that it matters or anything :P
Yeah, before the rain.. and it was hot out there. sorry.. for not being here either . I hope you're having a good day. Dress up like a cow yet?
oh, well.. it should get ready already, haha. kidding, of course :P. kidding, of course :P. sorry.. you're probably busy n' stuffs.. so I'll just leave you alone
you might be.. who knows :P . It's probably very tedious to have such a conversation though.. so I won't bother you any longer
If you say so :P
yay for what?
haha, okay. How are you?
I'm okay.. kinda bored :P
You got a job?. okay, have fun
oh, right. gotcha. well.. have fun with that. sounds awesome
why wouldn't it be fun?
haha, awesome. and I wouldn't say it's average.. I mean.. do you do it regularly?
Yeah :P
you could always go after/during the shopping stuffs
The experience would probably be the same with whoever you go with. plus the clothing stuffs is important
I was kinda hoping the same thing.. but it's okay if you're busy
haha, I'd go :P. but I'd understand you know :P
haha.. well have fun then
haha, with what? :P
I've got nothing to do :P. but thanks
I'm lost by both of those comments
oh, right :P. I wouldn't go to chik-fil-a alone :P
haha, weird how that works out. anyway, have fun with your stuffs
alright, have fun
I'm not :P. I didn't plan on anything for today :P. Mostly because you said stuffs
it'd be cool, but you seem pretty busy . and I don't have to get in the way
haha :P
well, I should probably let you keep on keepin' on :P
I don't know. whatever you want?
sorry :P
most likely 'or something' :P. bye
maybe :P. I'd say so :P
well.. then I'm just wrong.. like usual
nah, I usually am
really now?
oh, makes sense. :P. sounds like fun
where?
oh, I would, but aren't you busy n' stuffs
I don't even know when that time is :P
well.. I'm pretty free then.. but I don't know if I'd have a ride.. or a costume :P. I've got no black paper for spots :P. Wait.. I can improvise :P. But yeah.. the ride issue :P
well, sounds like fun :D
pretty sure?. You positive?
awesome :D
You're awesome too :D. sorry :P
why not?. You know it's true :D
Nah. You're so awesome :D
see? I'm true too :P. So like.. that means that you're awesome
Don't think about it.. let's just stick with "You're awesome" . anyway.. I guess I should let you get to that stuffs, whatever it may be :P
Fine.. we can do that :P
haha. I should probably stop being in the way :P. so.. have a great day :D
sorry for?
Oh it's cool, I'm assuming you're busy. And you probably are.. so like.. yeah, have fun with stuffs. Or you could be talking to someone way cooler than me.. which I understand too
well then it could just be someone else then .   :P. No matter, I'll just leave you to whatever you're doing.. I'm not that important anyway
What's with the question?. Is it like.. that there's definitely someone cooler.. . but ya just haven't met him yet
umm.. okay. Well.. I don't know what you're doing.. so to quit furthering anything at all.. and to quit being a bother.. I'll just go and find something to do.. or something
Of course I am. I mean.. I feel in the way now at least. Oh well.. I'll stop you from getting those "bleeps" from me at least. And I guess have a great rest of your day
Well if you don't.. that's okay. I'm just me after all
nah.. not really. I'm just another guy you know
I don't feel amazing, but thank you I suppose. Bye
That's a waste of a wish.. . bye...
especially then..
Not creepy sounding... but that's a waste of wishes
I'm certain there are better things out there
nah. Plus can't really say I'm better than myself
I'm not the best. I'm anything but
haha.. if I had anything productive to do. thanks for the thought though. I'll let you do the same
alright, bye. Have fun with things. :P
Whoa.. excited exclamation smiley face :P
Is it raining again?
Well it sounds like fun rain or shine
Yeah, even more fun with you.         Do you seriously still want to go?
I haven't either
 Yeah, I think so. and the last time I went there I could still *fit* in said castle
haha. crazy
If you want. Do I need anything in particular?
alright, I'll go get a white shirt then (assuming if I still have one :P). and I'll see you soon then
Sure, I've got it with me
awesome . bye (:
I'm sorry about stuffs.. yeah.. and they weren't downtown, they forgot about me :/. So.. I was walking around in the dark for a while (and every streetlight I walked by turned out for some reason) anyway.. have a good day tomorrow. Sleep well tonight; goodnight and sweet dreams (and sorry again)
Nope.. I called them, they told me they forgot. but I'm really sorry.. although I didn't.. really.. do much... but I'm really contemplating that whole "hole" deal.. so, yeah
Why should you be sorry?
it's whatever though.. I guess I'm still going to worry/wonder about stuff. oh.. yeah, a lot of fun :D. and that dying.. in a hole deal :P . But yeah! Have a great day tomorrow! I bet it'll be amazing :D. anyways, I'm going to go worry now.. goodnight and sweet dreams :D
I don't know.. I just don't know
And that's all there really is to worry about. sorry for what?
I'm sorry how I reacted. it was probably just an accident on your part. Can't blame you for anything, so don't be sorry :D. so yeah.. there's a hole.. just over there :P
Yeah, but no doubt bad butterflies :P. Those.. bad.. flying cute.. butterflies. And the hole is just calling.. because like.. I feel like I messed up. anyway.. you've gotta get to sleep so that you can do your stuffs tomorrow
psh..how could that be cute?. I mean.. really :P
That's no reason.. "oh, because it's you". nah... It's as bad as if some stranger had done something similar. :P
Well, it was bad of me, so I'm sorry. I don't know why your face was there though.. but still. It was my fault. so I accept whatever the punishment is
See? no.. it's not fine. Whatever the consequences may be.. I deserve it
If that's what it is.. then okay, attack me with butterflies :P. I am just a monster.. I don't see why you keep me around. like I said before.. there's a hole.. over there :P. oh.. and I shouldn't keep you so long.. you've gotta get some sleep
Don't blame yourself, I take full responsibility . I mean.. I committed an act of which you yourself do not condone, how could you get butterflies from that? :P. Nevertheless.. I really should let you sleep; you've got canoeing to do!
I'm going to worry about it :P. there's no stopping that
Well.. I feel bad either way. It was wrong of me.. because I know how you are. sorry.. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams
No you weren't... it's completely my fault. anyway, have fun tomorrow
permanent butterflies? :P. you're warm too
It could be soon :P
I bet it'll be around that time :P
So easy to forget about me, which may be for the best. You miss me already?
Could do that stuffs alone and just pretend I'm there. it's like.. the same affect. especially when you hug a pillow. haha.. you were even with me when you hugged that pillow.. so..
I don't know.. you insisted on hugging that pillow.. so I guess it's pretty special. My desk broke :/. I have to stay and hold it until some glue dries
I didn't break the desk
my sister tricked me into holding it up for her
See.. while that pillow prevented you from hugging me.. I tried hugging a pillow and it just wasn't the same. but yeah, you should get some sleep
Sushi cat though? That's got like.. my love all worked into it :D
but.. but.. it's way better! :D. Like.. it's cuter.. I guess, I mean.. considering my craftsmanship. It's like.. whenever you hug it.. it's like hugging a piece of me o.o
that's why it's got the "o.o" face goin' on
yeah :P. I still worried ish. in a way. less now :P. but anyway, I should stop keeping you up
about your face being so close n' all that. but yeah! goodnight :D
Well I'm keeping a desk from falling apart.. so I've got all night >:O. but you don't, so I'm just kidding :P
I can type with one hand. I'm that skilled. :P
I use my pinky for shifting :P. Weird, I know. I'm kinda curious as to what you were thinking, but seeing how you'll have to be awake to keep your canoe from sinking.. I'll just letcha sleep
?? :P
Well.. I'll keep that in mind next time. anyway, have fun tomorrow . (and don't miss me too much, which shouldn't be too hard :P)
next time whenever anything is anywhere :P. (it shouldn't be). I dunno :P. I don't care if you say it was "cute" or it "gave you butterflies" I was just being dumb.. and I didn't know what I was thinking. and my arm hurts... :P
I'm using my arm to prop it up. I'm not 'holding' it up :P. (: You're perfect.. But I was seriously being dumb :P. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams :D
you may say it's fine.. but there's a hole to say otherwise. kidding, of course. Darn it.. I broke it again :/. and if I don't hold it in place it'll slip out.. it's broken in a very odd way. and all the clamps are in the garage
it's some antique that's been here for as long as I can remember. I don't even know. oh well.. I won't be going to bed any time soon :P.    Doesn't mean you can't. sorry for those butterflies.  night
Still, sorry :P. Sleep well! :D
or break it more as I sleep on it
haha, alright cool. My heart's beating fast.. and butterflies are consuming my stomach.. . yeah :P. G'night, Leandra (:
I was wearing that one shirt.. and I thought of you :P. Bye :D
the I l<3ve you one
(:. I laheartve you too. (by the way, the Totoro drawing is on your wall now :P ). sorry, goodnight! (:
nothing.. just forget it. haha, because I'd know about it anywhere else
yeah, but the drawing wouldn't actually be on your wall wall :P. and nah.. no skills there
yeah, I'm sorry for keeping you. yeah, happens every night. always go to bed later than ya should :P. so.. I'll just leave with a simple 'goodnight, you'. oh, and a 'have fun :D'
My today will probably be very average :P. but thanks :D. Have an amazing time!
haha, the table is like.. about to fall ish. But no, I really don't know why I'm up this early. I kinda had this weird dream where I got kidnapped . anyway, yeah! have fun, and I think I might go crash or something
It's very crazy.. it doesn't really feel that early though :P I kinda still miss you :P.. sorry, anyway, have a great time!! :D. bye (:
Just a sleeping crash :P and thinking about the dream now, it totally didn't make sense but it was so real o.o. like.. I woke up in the dream, got dressed n' everything.. but then I really woke up and pretty much did the same thing because I was worried that the dream was true. Be safe!.. I almost forgot to say that :P and good luck canoeing, sounds like a lot of fun :D. I hope you had fun! :D anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams 
My day was.. lacking :P but thanks :D You're amazing, by the way
Lacking you :/. sorry, corny, I'll just letcha get some sleep, you've probably had a long day :P
alright, sounds like fun! I'll try to wake up at that time (where would you be if I happen to?)
alright, sounds like fun, I'll try to catch you then.. I mean, if you want :P (you could.. walkie me?). That actually might not work :p.. But I'd like to :p. Anyway.. Goodnight and sleep well with sweet dreams :p
I'll try and make sure it works out :P
I can always come to you?/Meet you half way?
alright, well.. I'm ready whenever, just say the words and I'm there :P
So.. when exactly? haha. I don't know.. so I'm gonna go now :P
I think I saw this text happen :P anyway.. have a great day and goodbye.. forever :P
Why would you be sorry? It's cool, nothing to be sorry about. I'm sorry for being on time :P
It's cool, I didn't mind. I hope you have a great day, by the way. sorry for.. stuffs
Maybe. but you seemed pretty serious about "bye forever"
sure you can.. especially when it's just some guy, right?. anyway.. I should probably go now.. so bye and have a great rest of your day. Bye :D
I really like you, by the way.. you're amazng! 
you have fun with your stuffs :P
bye :D. maybe I'll see you later :P. I doubt it though :/. :P
Very crazy :P. And I was only doubting it because you seemed busy n' stuff (You'll always be in my heart :D) Have a great day (:. Apparently last night was the Fairy Odd Parents movie.. and I missed it :/
I saw that it played again :P but I missed it still. Hello there. I probably missed you :P oh well, have a great day
nah.. I missed it again
Exactly :P
I'm bored.. so I've resorted to doodling, you?
I would be, but I wouldn't want to take up your time
Sure?
Let me go ask then
My father has agreed :P. When were you thinking would be a good time?
Alright, sounds good (:. Mind if I bring my doodles?. :P
haha, okay! neat :D. Well.. see you soon then (:
I'm sorry... I'm just an idiot. I jumped off that wall to prove it. I'm just.. sorry for everything, and I'll stop bothering you. have fun tomorrow, goodnight and sweet dreams. You'd be better off if I just got lost..
It's not okay.. I'm just going to go to stop myself from bothering you
anything stupid*
it's okay, I'm not going to forgive you because there's nothing to forgive. you didn't do anything wrong
it's completely my fault. .. I was about to throw my drawings away
no.. :/
I did though.. it's just what you don't know
I.. I just don't know what to do. Most of the time I feel like I'm just there.. and whenever I think of what I should do.. but then I don't do it. so I'm regretting not doing it but also relieved at the same time
I'm just completely confused over nothing
I don't even know what you want or anything.. and not really relieved.. but like.. I know that I shouldn't have even though I didn't. but something in me said I should've. and I don't know
I don't know. so it's really nothing.. but I'm confused either way
Well thanks, that means a lot. but being confused leaves me.. just I don't know. I just sat down to contemplate things. and when I couldn't give you an answer to "what's wrong?" because the answer was 'nothing' I felt bad for making you stay
It's fine, it's.. kinda nice when you attack me. but like.. I don't know.. I was really just wasting your time
Have you seen the music video to that song?. It's so.. fishy
Nah, the tackle was fine. It's not like it hurt or anything. It's playful n' stuff. so it was fun n' stuff
I wasn't paying much attention. If I saw it coming, maybe :P
yeah, haha :D
it's the snitch
and nah, it wasn't that special
yup. why wouldn't they be?
oh.. right.. had to walk it off. but I'm fine now
I.. don't know :P
Anyway.. I was only confused.. by you :P
It's okay, it's my fault for getting confused. I'm not sure you'd want to tell me
Do what one day?
1. !*. awesome 
I just felt like you didn't want me around.. so I was a little disappointed. but like.. I get confused so many times anyway.. 
I like walking you to your house..
It's like.. you're valuable treasure.. and I'm delivering you to somewhere safe. but like.. anyone could steal you if left alone. :P
sorry to put it that way..
I just wouldn't want anything to happen to you. and although I'm probably not the best, I still would like to be around to keep you safe
All I care about is your safety
plus.. who would want to steal me anyway?. I'd say I'm pretty safe
I have no fan girls :P. sigh.. am I just your friend?
so I'm just your best friend?
Well, okay. I don't know much the difference either. I guess I'm just asking to stop part of the confusion :P
I don't know :P
I'm sorry. what is "boyfriend/girlfriend stuffs" anyway?
wait.. I'm lost, are you asking that question now?
oh, okay
Right :P
which is?. I don't know :P
I'd say so. I just thought you preferred "just friends" or something like it. so I didn't know whether I dissolved into that
Well.. seeing me all the time would probably change.. and I probably couldn't hug you or anything
Why don't you think that?
What do you not know?. And I'd say, if you say that, that I'm an awful boyfriend. plus, you did a pretty good job at cheering me up.. most people would just quit (which you eventually did) but you lasted longer than most :P
I gotcha. I don't know what small stuff is.. like.. if my favorite animal is a zebra?
I don't have a preference to animals.. they're all pretty nifty 
Could you.. elaborate on small stuff though?
right, I gotcha :P
nah, not at all
Isn't it normal to wonder about that stuff?
I mean, wanting to know everything just means you want to know.. everything. because like.. knowing everything means that you know them really well and that makes them like.. something :P. I don't know what I'm saying :P
There is something I don't like.. :P. but it's not important and affects you in no way
:P
umm.. no. Just like.. I don't like how a question I get a lot is "have you kissed yet?" :P
I don't mind like.. anything that causes the question. I just like.. it's annoying to get that question so many times :P
Yup :P
I guess.. I feel like the only way for it to stop is if I said yes :P. Or if I don't talk to anyone :P
I.. like the second :D
Yeah, but I'd be lying if I chose the first option
haha, sorry
how? what? :P
nah, I really doubt it
really?
I get asked by the same people.. several times :P
but I'm surprised they asked you :P
Oh, gotcha 
haha, is that what you do?
awesome
haha, and ask again? no way :P
that may only work on your friends
Don't be worried :P
Umm.. amazing super special awesome people. like you (:
:/
I don't have palm freckles because I'm not as amazing as you.. and the sad face is because you completely rejected what I think of you. yeah :/
It's not impossible, you somehow make it possible, right?. it may sound silly, but I think really highly of you
maybe. it may also sound a little silly (maybe even creepy) but I feel like.. an "eskimo kiss" would be.. neat? umm... never mind, not going to send that :P. and.. I just did.. never mind, I'm gonna go.. crawl in a hole :P
sigh.. yes, pressed it 
you think so?
:3. sounds cute :P
I was talking about giving one though :P. sorry
umm.. I don't know. I don't know how you feel about things
maybe?. Maybe now is a time to crawl in the hole?
A very comfy hole :P. may stay there a while
of course . (an eskimo kiss is when both noses touch, if you weren't aware of that?). stay in that hole forever!
I feel dumb.. right now, so before I say anything else stupid.. I'll letcha go, because you've gots stuffs to do tomorrow. and I wasn't sure you knew.. because you said it was just my nose :P. sorry.. still dumb..
I guess it's different now.. but I don't know of any one else...
sorry..
yeah, I'm going to go before I say anything else dumb. I still feel a little sorry for that thing that happened a few days ago. Friday :P
My head's all like trying to justify myself. like.. you got close and I sorta walked into your face :P
aw.. I'm so dumb..... I'm just going to go. have fun tomorrow
I'm none of those things . I don't know anything about anything
anything as to what I'm supposed to do.. or something like that. I mean.. I don't know what you're thinking when you get really close and look me in the eyes.. sorry. like I said.. I can just go
confused by what?
right.. well. I get confused by stuffs like that. sorry
It's cool. I just don't know what's going on in your head.. so I'm just like "what's wrong?"
I'm sorry still
right... or something :P. maybe I did though :P
haha, from what? :P
Me.. either
haha, alright... I'm sorry for that poking thing . /tickling/making you stop? :P. I don't know..
anyway, I should probably let you get goin' n' stuff. you're not?. what's with the spazzing out then?
right.. :P. I'm sorry though. I didn't know I smelt good, by the way :P. sorry. I'm stupid, okay?. anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams. you've got a crazy 7/11 day tomorrow :P
better how? . You're already perfect. (:
Do I know? I know you're amazing and everything. And you're really special, and I care about you. so I guess I do "know" :P
(: thanks
Thank you for the same :D. I seriously don't know the "y'know" thing.. . but it probably doesn't matter
the usual?
haha.. okay
well.. still, you're perfect in every single way. sorry for what?
You're my everything and I'm glad I could be apart of yours :P. whoa.. I just finished off a bowl of cereal
don't ":/ hmm" it scares me :P
sorry, and I will always care about you (:
it's not what I'd prefer.. but if that's what you want.. then I guess so
It's okay, it only just confuses me extremely and it makes me feel like that's what you want in turn breaking my heart ever so slightly until you actually make such a thing official where it'll just shatter but I'll still try and be there for you
what worry?. I'm sorry for not being able to recall
You're scared?
I mean, it's really not a big deal. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared. and I'm okay.. not. so.. yeah :P
haha, sorry. but I mean, it's a scary thing and it's really not all that important
oh, right. well, the questions aren't so bad. I guess it's just silly
it's not even that important now
I'd also be too nervous to do anything about it in the first place :P. the very thought scares me and makes my heart race. I don't know what I'm saying
haha, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this up
haha, alright :P. For other people of course . just kidding :P
right.. gotcha. sorry. .... I heard people are always scared of their first kiss.. which I guess isn't your case. You're more afraid of other stuffs, I think.. is what I gathered... I don't even know. sorry, I'll just let you get some sleep for that awesome day you'll have tomorrow!. not something.. I should have said I don't think.. anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams
sorry.... bye I guess
yeah.. me too. So I usually just don't think about it and say it's not that important
I do. why do you ask?. Do you say what you mean?
sometimes it's hard to know where I stand 
oh.. well
Well.. I mean everything I say and you make me extremely happy. because you're what's important (L. (: *
Oh.. and stand as in.. I'm quoting a song that hits home :P
yeah :P. But I mean it, you're what's important! (:. Or to quote Modest Mouse.. you're the good things
it's plastic that's how it can melt. and I wish I could help out :P. I wish you'd believe me..
I don't think so... You're perfect and fun and awesome (:. and warm :P. sorry
but yeah, you're amazing
I wish I could help. But the blankets would probably be better
yeah, though.. you're important to me and I care about you (:. Well.. I meant the first kind of better... maybe the second kind too :P
aw (: thinking about you makes me smile :D. and nah.. blankets are amazing!!! o.p. o.o*
aw.. I'm all the way over here though :P
You're very perfect, Leandra! (:. and I wish I could be there for you.. at all times :P
I guess not. I can wait until it's practical though :D. sorry.. um
(:
Well, be from me to keep you awake. (it's because I'm boring you to sleep :P)
2 bodies, 1 heart 
Whoa.. you knew?. I just found the band :P
less impressive on my part
Still beating me.. I've heard 3 
but yeah.. that song made me think of you (:
sorry, corny :P
I haven't listened to that one. if I do then.. you know
5 years time made you think of me?
I was talking about 2 bodies 1 heart :P. oh, right, haha. okay. :P. sorry. I must be sleepy too
so umm.. I should just letcha get some sleep :D
sleep well :D goodnight and sweet dreams (:. have a great day tomorrow at the orientation 
yes you can
I just got to that part. and you haven't
but yeah :D
In five years time I may not know you. oh.. wait
you may just prove me wrong
I like that song (:. And I like that lyric you sent
I don't feel like I need to be James Dean any longer
aw.. yeah
I'm glad I'm not like him
I bet he never had a girl as amazing as you. So I'm pretty much better off than he
lame, I know. I'm sorry
You're cute (:. Anyway, I should let you sleep . Because sleep is important. and you're important. and it's important that you get some sleep
that's important too. so.. get warm too . :D. Goodnight and sweet dreams (: sleep well! :D
Thanks for letting me :P. sorry for being "lame" later on though. I shoulda just let you cheer me up :P. But thanks for talking to me now :D
haha.. well I'm glad you're here then. I love you..r existence 
I hope one day you do too.  L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N, got more than money and sense my friend. you've got heart. sorry, more of Noah and the Whale. :P
Goodnight, Leandra (:
As long as I'm with you forever . sorry.. bye (:
Exactly! :D. But you too, have so much fun tomorrow n' forever :D
I know it was sarcasm.. . but I made it so it wasn't :D. Because you're really fun (: and amazing at everything. and pretty much perfect. Bye Leandra. (:
You're also so nice (:. Night :D. :/. I just broke the desk again
It just.. fell and landed in my lap. such a shame :/. or well, good night :D
haha, it is.. but it's okay I guess. It feels more desk-like without it. anyway, before I keep you up any longer. Goodnight n' bye, Leandra; have a great day tomorrow and you're amazing (had to fit that in there :D)
It only broke off a part of it. :P. :D. bye!! (:. Thank you for making me smile and giving me butterflies :D
I'm glad you can too (you're the only one who can). Ttfn
haha, bye (:
oh thanks.. I'll figure out how to fix it :P
You're awesome! (: and have an awesome day :D
Which is perfect for an orientation :D have loads of fun (:
I'll try.. dunno what to do though :P but yeah, have a great time, bye 
nah, nothing fun :P but... maybe
You're way cooler (:
haha, nice :P
What's here in Blacksburg that you can't have there?
Right.. just there :P
I meant that's the category I fall under. yeah :P
nah, I'm fine being wherever 
Haven't done anything out of the ordinary. you?
Nice :P
nice, that sounds awesome!
I woke up kinda late and didn't do much of anything
nah.. it wasn't boring though. Aw.. I'm sorry. I actually forgot until you said something. they have a limit on cups though.. so I feel like it'd be too late for me
yeah, I know where 3 are.. so I can always best my luck
sorry for what?. You're cooler
whatever you say is perfect
Why do you wish that? I doubt there's anything that special here . That can wait at least
and?
I'm just a guy who's not going anywhere
I miss you too easily too.. so I'll just have to make sure not to disappear. so nothing to worry about
Do you really think so?
well, I'll try not to change so much
haha, I'll try to
haha, alright. I'll try my best
Same here.. but knowing my luck and my balance.. it wouldn't work out so well
Well, not really. but thanks for the thought
Thank you for being the same and more (:
The summer's already almost gone. I can't wait for what's left of it :P
swimming? nice. have fun with that!. I'll go.. do.. something :P. Have a great rest of your day :D
haha, sounds awesome. Have fun while you're there. I'll letcha get goin' now :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams if I don't get a chance to say it later (:
you too :D. Bye (:. You're amazing (:
tah tah for now :P
Goodnight, Leandra. Sweet dreams! (: and have a good day tomorrow :D
Good morning :D and you too, have lots of fun! (:
I take it that you had a good day n' stuff :D. Anyhow, goodnight and sweet dreams! (:
They're the carrots that didn't grow big enough.. so instead of just throwing them away (because they're rejects) they sell them anyway and call them "baby carrots" :P. haha, night, Leandra. (: I hope you had a good day :D
Yeah :P Coldplay *is* known for stealing music (kidding, but.. apparently it's happened) Anyway, I hope you have a great day today and.. stuffs :D (I kinda miss you, so.. sorry :P) but yeah! Have an awesome day (:. Good morning and you're right.. it does sound pretty familiar :P
Okay, bye then...
It's me :P. Bye again :P
You said bye first.. I was just saying bye thinking you were leaving... and I'm still assuming that you are :P
I'm.. lost :P cool?. So.. you left, but now you're back?. Or you're.. not.. okay, well have a nice day (:
I don't care whether it does or not :P. Not like I'm going outside anyway...
Can't really enjoy it now :P plus it's kinda cool outside at the moment. Anyway, I shouldn't take up any more of your time.. have a nice day in whatever you do!
crazy. yeah, you too, enjoy your day and possibly some sunniness stuffs. anywho.. I'll get out of your way. Weird.. it's like.. sunny now :P
I'm good, how are you?. I thought you were going :P
Oh, that's awesome. Blacksburg missed you
I missed you too :P
sorry. Yeah.. me too. umm.. okay
Yeah... so crazy
It's okay, don't have to be sorry. and I.. can't really remember my yesterday that well.. I guess it wasn't so great
or maybe that was it. How was your yesterday?
That sounds pretty amazing. Better than my day.. oh yeah.. I mowed some lawns yesterday. :P
nah.. my lawn mower wouldn't start. so I used a pair of safety scissors. I was out there the entire day
I was running with scissors one day, down the stairs. almost died. maybe I should have though :P
Just imagine if I tripped down those stairs. Too bad, huh?
unfortunately I survived... :P
... umm, sure
you're right..
You put your arms around me and I believe that it was easier for you to let me go . I heard that song yesterday.. it's kinda.. lame to admit
But yeah.. easier for you to let me go :P
I was trying to.. use the lyrics to.. say something :P
Umm.. okay
nope, you didn't
I don't know how I feel about it. It reminds me of stuff though
.. of course
yup.... Speaking of scissors and them hurting you..
I'm good.. I'm going to go.. get a bandaid so.. brb
Oh.. those too
yeah.. I just went to pick up a sheet of paper. and this pair of scissors apparently fell near them.. and they were open
so.. yeah.... pretty much
nope..
sorry
apparently my broken desk also can cut you..
nah.. it's not bad enough for a bandaid. the other cut.. that needed it :P
Yeah, and I'm inside.. it'd probably get worse outdoors
I know.. but if I go.. I'll probably die. I mean.. unless that's a good idea
Yeah, but today may be a bad day. nah.. I wasn't really planning on leaving my house today. Nothing to do :P
not for me. :P. I'm sure you've got a lot to do though
Exactly my point :P. you've got that paper mache right?. You could do that.. I'm sure it's better than talking to me
Talking to me isn't that great and/or important. whereas that thing you're making sounds pretty.. important :P
I don't see how that's ironic.. but okay :p. still.. probably better to spend your time productive than wasting it talking to me :P
that's gotta be better than talking to me, why don't you do that?. I'm lame, and that sounds like a lot of fun :D
Do you know how amazing 'ice cube shaped ice cream' sounds?. I shouldn't get in the way of that
*SO* amazing :D. Way more amazing than me. Which is pretty easy to do.. but still
I'd probably make it less fun. but thanks for the thought, I'd love to. If I weren't so lame of course
4 hours isn't that long of a time :P
haha, because I make time fly?. kidding of course :P
I'm not magical :P
I guess you thought wrong :P. Because I'm just some guy
Not really :P. But thanks
okay.. have fun
Thanks? . Bye I guess
sounds like a great idea... too bad it takes a long time.. . I kinda have to go soon.... not that both of those things relate.. at all. and before you happen to say "Oh, have fun".. no.. I won't have fun.. I don't want to go. I just want to stay home
I'm going to the other side of town for a few hours
And no.. don't hope I have fun. I'm tempted to just.. disappear before I get picked up
It's whatever... and I mean.. there's more to Blacksburg than just here
yeah... well. just forget about it. have a nice day and everything
...... ..thanks...
.. I hate myself... bye
It's nothing.. I'm just not doing so hot
.... thanks.. again
I will when I get back. actually... scratch that.. I'll just die when I get back. so.. goodbye
not if I die...
that's silly..
yeah, I don't really care.. 
Not about the part about you still loving me even then. I just.. I don't care about anything else. Because I still care about you. I just want to die though
I'm sorry..
Like I said.. I hate myself
I'll just go now.. bye
Never am I awesome.. I'm just worthless, bye.. goodnight if I disappear somehow
how much later? like.. a month?. ... bye
Oh and it looks like I did something wrong.. . I don't know.. I couldn't be that fun at tennis. I've played probably once in my life
I don't even know.. but they're yelling at me
I'm just worthless..
It's not them.. everyone is
I'm just a screw up.. and I'm worthless... 
I don't feel so perfect.. I'm just ruining everything
thanks.. but I don't feel so great right now
maybe later.. 
I'm going to crawl into a hole and just whither away. and I don't have any ice cream.. 
Nah, you couldn't miss me that much
it'll be easy to let me go. no worries..
haha.. not that it would help.. but I could use a hug right about now.... oh well.. I can always hug myself, right?
I've got this little red bear 
but it won't help... I wish it could..
It's cool.. it's more important.. or urgent . Have fun.. I'm sorry if like.. never mind. bye
more urgent then..
no you won't be.. but it's okay. bye...
If I ever return... .. thanks..... you too. bye
You can't contact me from here :P
bye..
Bye, Leandra... no I'm not. I'd say you are. but you wouldn't accept it. but.. I'll get out of your way now.. good timing I suppose
I was...
Well.. I just came in for water.. I was going to go back out.. I didn't think you wanted to see me all too much. Actually.. yeah.. I'm going to run some more.. 
I don't.. but I haven't ran in a while. and.. mostly I'm trying to clear my head. I don't know if I should stop by your house a second time :P
I mean.. I ran through Harding. So I was near ish to your house
There's so much stuff in the way, awful vantage point :P. but yeah.. I suppose I'll go out again
So I may be out that way.. but in the state I'm in.. you wouldn't want to see me
I wasn't paying attention... I kinda just fell down a hill prior to that
Before
Probably best not to if you want to stay safe
right... well I think I may be off. I can't promise whether or not I'll stop by, but I will run by :P. On Harding at least :P
Maybe your street
yeah, bye
Aw what?. I'm sorry if I did anything. Sorry, but I gotta go.. 'brb' and get something on my arms.. 
Oh.. I was kind of down. And I didn't think you needed to see that.. I didn't want to bother you either. to be honest though... I stayed in that little park thingy with those benches for a while
I didn't go look at them. I walked back in the direction of that loop I was running on 
yeah... I'm sorry
sure there is..
I'm not
I don't come anywhere near it
I feel like.. I wanted to talk to you more.. but I felt so down that I didn't want to bother you. :/
So I sat at a bench for a while
I thought about how terrible of a person I could be
I made you leave. worst thing I could ever do 
still :/
Nah.. I just.. I didn't want to bother you. I felt like.. I was just too much of a waste of space. so I didn't want to waste your time
I feel so worthless
I don't know.. I just felt like I did nothing right today.. and it made me think that if I saw you.. I'd mess things up then too
No I wasn't.. but thanks
I think that hug's setting in, haha. sorry
My heart?
I'm feeling better (:
not that you said that.. or anything
Really? I just thought you always smiled.. like.. at all times
haha, well I love you-r smile, so I'm glad (:. sorry :P. But thank you.. so much for being there for me, it means a lot (:
but I.. forgot to get those things, so I'll just be a second
Well knowing that you were there for me is comforting, so thank you (:. And I'm still really warm :P
I'm in the coldest room in my house.. and I'm really really warm. which.. is a bit gross :P. haha, moist :P
No, don't be sorry . (:. anyway I'll be gone for a second, unless you leave before I get back.. 
oh.. well, that makes sense
So.. now. well.. okay then. bye. I haven't had dinner either.. so.. you know. I understand :P
really :P. ouch..
haha, I'm fine. Aw.. got my hopes up
me too :P
Aw.. okay. I'm.. still doing something though. oh! I would happen to be free tomorrow. if that.. matters. anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams (:. thank you (:
Nah, you're amazing (:
You're so perfect (:
I hope so too. thank you again
Have a great dinner and a great night (:
I bet it was already pretty great to start with. Whoa.. reminded me.. you were in my dream last night :P
Well.. there were aliens 
and they were going to destroy the world. and I don't want to say the rest. so.. bye (:
Nah.. I didn't.. I woke up before they killed everyone. But umm.. maybe I'll tell you later. have fun n' stuff (:. Bye :D. You're so amazing!. Sweet dreams
haha, maybe I did >:O
You're cooler! Goodnight, Leandra. (:
You're coolest :D. just saw the 'a' :P Don't know how I feel about being a cooler :P
I suppose that's true.. haha :P. I hope you have a great day n' stuffs (:. Have a good morning and have fun. I have to do some stuffs for a little bit.. so.. bye for now
don't be sorry for the pokes :P I'm poking back, aren't I?. And yeah, you too, have fun with whatever you do. I'm starting to think that it didn't matter whether I was free or not :P. But I'm officially free now.. not that it matters
Unfree as in how?. I suppose. or I mean.. yes
Ah.. well.. have fun with that then. Bye
Yeah, have fun though
Alright.. I suppose I can find something to do :P
Yeah, have a bunch of fun (:
I didn't know if you wanted to/or were able to
Well then I'd like to
When would be a good time for you?
That sounds like a good time
Nothing in particular, I'm cool with anything. Whatever you want to do is fine by me
Haha, awesome. is that what you'd like to do?. Or have you played too much already :P. ?*
Both sound like fun
very cool
Well.. I should probably let you get to something or other
I don't know.. doing something before you did something with me :P
haha, alright. well I'll let you do that. and I'll see you in that 15 minutes :P
It's very difficult. but okay.. 30 minutes it is
Umm.. sure, your house. unless you wanted to go somewhere else
great idea..
even better idea
tennis? haha
Yeah, let's do all of that stuff in one afternoon
There's one right next to my house.. but that's far away from you
Nah, the hand n' hand would be closer
totally, haha
stalker :P. just kidding
Anyway, I'll let you get to your stuffs
Okay, good.. I was actually about to say that . , "lemme know if you can" :P
No.. it's locked up. Can't get inside :P
I got in before they knew the window to the basement could open. And the reason they found out was because I accidentally broke said window. Anyway, I'll see you later hopefully
sorry
alright, good, haha. Have fun. bye for now
Sorry.. I was away for a moment. and I haven't played . I was actually trying to get on another computer.. but it took a very *very* long time
well.. sorry still. :P. Sorry.. but, can you do anything?
oh, awesome (:
When would you be able to?
okay, good to know. anything I should bring?. possibly? :P. Umm.. okay.. I'll see you soon then 
Okay, no problem. thank you, I'll get grab it. Bye (:
I'm still sorry . but goodnight and sweet dreams (:. You most likely crashed as soon as you got home :P
What could you be sorry for?. You're way cooler
I'm sorry. Hold your breath?
Don't be sorry about that. I hugged back (:
I'm sorry for keeping you up and wasting your time.. and for other stuffs
And for hugging you back.. I guess I shouldn't have since you have to be sorry for it
Yeah well.. oh well. I'm going to take my bandage off :P
It's fine
I'm sorry that.. you know. :/. sorry. anyway.. goodnight (: sweet dreams
what you're scared of? or something.... I don't know. Sad stuffs?
I don't know :/. I should probably let you sleep though. so.. goodnight (:
haha.. doughnuts :P. Don't be sorry though. I really, really don't know what you could be sorry for
Don't be sorry for the hugging. and we should have made some :P. but I guess there's always tomorrow?
I know you do :P
haha, yeah :P. Well, you're amazing. and I'm sorry about.. stuffs. 'love stuffs' . I don't know.... anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams
I.. am too. another thing to worry about...
it's okay. it's not even the most out there thing. so.. I'll worry about it the least
I'll worry more about that sad stuffs :P
Why worry about that then? Why let it end badly?
Thinking about that now just means you know it'll happen... It's like.. a risk people have to take :P
Exactly. But I don't know what there is to worry about. for it to end poorly.. . I don't know how it could. Well I mean.. there's that song that goes "you put your arms around me and I believed it would be easier for you to let me go". you know.. :P. And I'm cool with that.. breaking my heart is fine by me. and I'm just.. blabbing on.. so.. yeah :P
I don't know.. the song is talking about how she's in love with the guy.. but she doesn't want to get hurt so she won't let him in close because she thinks he'll just break her heart. and he would let her go
Don't know
I never truly loved until you. yeah.. it probably is. But yeah, the only way out is to break my heart.. and I will try my best not to make things end badly. and I mean... you let go once, so.. it'll just be easier the next time
It's great you don't have hiccups
You're warm too (:
Will do. I don't want to let go at all
Nah, like I said... once before :P. But it's whatever
It's cool
I'm sorry for that
I wasn't important then, and I'm still not.. 
and I don't have to hug you.. even though I.. think it's kinda sorta nice. Nah, how could I be important?. there's just no way
My emotions don't matter.. I don't matter. It's probably why people find it so hard to get me to smile. because it's all not important. but it's whatever, I suppose. and I should letcha sleep
Saying what?. You didn't say anything wrong
It's not like it affected how I felt. It just.. told me something
I don't know. I.. . It's not important. I should just let you get some sleep
Like, I don't know. You don't seem to want to tell me much.. so all of it is assumptions
that my heart's going to get broken.. something along those lines. but that's cool. it doesn't matter that much anyway
I like your generalization though.. with the whole "bad stuffs happens"
because sometimes bad things don't happen
but seriously, it's just a waste of a muscle. I'd say it is possible
If you didn't believe in the hope to begin with.. and if you don't know.. then I guess there isn't hope. now*. I guess that just means the bad things are bound to happen
I don't know.. . believing is more of an unconditional thing. it doesn't matter though.. I don't even matter.. just forget about me and the bad stuffs won't happen at all. So.. goodnight and sweet dreams. I don't know what bad stuffs could happen.. sure it could, but not worrying about it and taking the risk is what makes things worth it (cliche) so I wouldn't think there's anything to be scared of... Bye.
I still.. I don't know. I'm sorry
I really really like you too, Leandra. You probably don't even know though..
Don't even know how much I like you
It's okay (:. And maybe you will find out, who knows?
You're warm too
Me too. I love being with you
Why wouldn't it be?. I mean.. why would it be?. by the way.. not to sound creepy or anything.. but you smell nice
I don't know what's with it though. Like.. I get constant reminders of you. like.. I'll smell something and think of you, or I'll see something and the same thing happens
I don't know.. I think about you a lot. sorry
I have no idea. My guess would be you. sorry..
nah.. that'd be silly
very 'zilly'. and I should let you get sleep too. sorry about stuffs. remember though.. there's really not much to be afraid of
you didn't either. You're perfect (:
right :P
I'll be there for you any time. I don't know where I was though o.o. just kidding :P. Goodnight, Leandra. You're amazing, or at least you are to me (:
If you give a little love you can get a little love of your own
I'm glad my arms are comfy just so you stay :P. oh.. the lyric goes on to "don't break his heart"
(:
I'd like it if you stayed (:. Don't break my heart, Leandra :P
It's fine. Goodnight, Leandra. (: Sweet dreams and have a great day tomorrow. oh yeah.. I had a dream with you in it.. with aliens too :P. I guess it's late to tell you now :P
Maybe some other time.. although I'll probably forget
Might forget tomorrow :P
Well. So the aliens came. and I said "I may die tonight.. so if that's the case I know who I want to spend my final time with". and it was Elvis Costello . Just kidding.. I like.. ran over to you in the dream. it's really corny and lame.. and if there weren't any aliens it could have made a little bit of sense
I held you in my arms and then woke up. again.. corny and lame
You have once before. I wish you could again though.. if that doesn't sound creepy
sorry... I meant it like.. I don't know. The way it's said.. is creepier than I meant it. I don't know.. I'm sorry. If only though :P. haha.. camping :P. sorry, anyway. goodnight, Leandra! (:. Sleep well. bye. :D. ah, sorry. I'll just go. Good morning, I hope you slept well (: I have to go mow soon :P anyway.. have a great day :D
It's fine, it looks like sleep couldn't wait :P. haha, I found cow pajamas that would have been perfect for cow day :D
umm.. no.. randomly after I mowed the lawns in my house :P. I'm still sorry about stuffs, by the way
it's not fine :P.. but okay, I gotta go.. mow more apparently... so have a great day today :D sorry that you almost fell asleep on me :P
haha, okay :P done :P you too, and don't be sorry. That's what I'm there for :P
wasn't that fast :P. it would have been faster had I had help.. but my sister ditched me and I had to mow it by myself
haha, the other lawn mower was broken.. so it's okay :P and I'll let you know, but it may not be that much fun. Okay.. I don't know how it happened.. but somehow... I'm wearing the cow pj's
probably magic.. or I just wanted to put it on :P. It looks silly if you couldn't figure that on your own :P
anyway.. I'll let you get to your day n' what not.. you've probably talked to me enough by now
sure you can
aren't you tired of me?
Tired of myself?. Of course... like I said.. really easy to get tired of me
I couldn't get tired of you.. I love everything about you (: I'd go as far and say I love you.. but I don't know how you'd feel about that.. so I won't
sorry..
You're really really cool (:. sorry.. . anyway.. like I said.. I should let you get on with something.. 
I don't know.. anything could be better than talking to me. like.. tennis or.. paper mache
Still.. I'm not that great. but paper mache is :D
Well.. I'd like to help.. I'd say I'm alright with that sort of stuff. But you know.. I could get in the way too :P
A surprise to who?. I can keep it a secret :P
oh.. well.. okay then. Never mind then
Well I wish I could help.. but oh well :P
I guess so . it would have been neat 
haha, okay. haha, you still have donuts you need to make :P
Sorry for what?. I'd like to.. but I thought you were just doing it by yourself
Yea.. I'm not too great to see two days in a row. I don't know why I can't see it :P. but okay
if you say so. but yeah.. you just say me yesterday.. I'm not that special :P
Nah.. plus your sister will make a comment about me always being over there. I'd like to.. but you know.. :P
Well.. that changes this a little bit. but I'm still not that great. It's like.. carol lee donuts.. . first day you get it it's amazing.. but the second day it's alright but eventually it's all dry and nasty. :P
that's just crazy. but I'm not one of those doughnuts. I'm just some guy
Better than doughnuts? no way
Have you actually spent the time to have fun with a doughnut? it's amazing :P
way better at tennis than I am. And I mean.. if you get hungry afterwards...
You just get a new doughnut
What's me?. not the same?
oh.. okay? :P
it's okay
If you want. And Winnie the Pooh afterwards?. if you want :P. I'd think it'd be fun
yay :D. awesome. You're amazing (:
You're cooler (:
... sure?. sorry :P. You're amazing (:. sorry. should I be letting you get to something?. because I can :P
Don't be sorry
aw.. . well.. have fun
I wish I could come too.. oh well. I'll let you get going then... have fun
I've got nothing to do.. :/
haha, but yeah.. I hope it's good. bye :D
Good idea.. I can't putt-putt.. but I think I have hot chocolate. anyway.. have fun. bye
haha, okay. Bye. sigh, haha. have fun! :D
Nah.. everyone is leaving... That's cool. I hope the movie is good :D. Have a great day! :D. I guess I have to.. find something to do. Buh bye (:
I said you could. I'll find something. sorry for keeping you here :P. I'll talk to  you later or something (:
bye (:. I.. didn't know you were still on . unless you're gone now... sorry.. I'm such a bother
I am a bother.. but I guess you're talking to someone else or doing something more important. so I'll just go
well.. either way. I guess I'll go
have fun at your movie. I can't wait either. bye
Have fun eating too :P
exactly. the bestest
I'm sorry, I wouldn't know why you would. It's just me and it's just been a day
You're more amazing.. and I'll admit I miss you too. but you know.. it's just been a day
I'm sorry
don't you have that movie thing to look forward to?. anyway, have fun with it. I'll talk to you later. Bye. again. sorry for popping in and out. I'll stop doing that
Oh well.. 2 hours, hmm?. That's still something to look forward too. !!. You could catch up with the movie. It's only like.. an hour and 44 minutes or something. You could start it and then go straight to the movie theatre. And you've seen a little bit with me, so you could jump ahead so you'd have plenty of time (:
You should do it (:
I would, but you'd have to wait on me or something
I'm not worth the wait
You should just start it without me
I don't hear the music. weird
hmm.. maybe. Anyway, you should just watch it without me
go for it!!. You've got plenty of time between now and 8
I've got nothing to get to. I'll let you get to the movie, if you choose to watch it
If I want to what?. Watch it now?
Umm.. I guess I can be over as soon as possible?
I like walking
Maybe... Alright. well.. see you soon then?
okay then.. bye 
I hope the movie was awesome (aside from it being serious) goodnight and sweet dreams! (:
Why wouldn't I want to do something with you? You're awesome :D It's probably silly that I stayed up until 1:13 to talk to you, but I kinda fell asleep.  I had fun too and I am free, if that even matters :P If you're doing stuffs then have fun n' have a great day (:
Yeah.. I guess we have done stuff recently. so if that affects whether or not you want to do something.. that's okay
crazy
Doesn't affect me at all :P
I know.. so crazy o.o
exactly! o.o
Let's do it :D. :P
Neat
Where you thinking now?. Because.. I was going to ask when :P
Well.. I could.. . But most likely.. as soon as possible/. ?*
Whenever is a good time for you
alright :P
okay, so whenever is best for you :P
sounds good to me. I'll go and do some stuffs in the mean time and let you do stuffs too (:. I'll see you soon, bye
No, I can get one
Thanks though
Nothing to be excited for :P
Well I mean.. I guess.. doughnuts. but not me :P. Bye (:
I thought so :P
Oh well.. doesn't matter that much, does it?
It doesn't get dark for another.. just what I was about to say. Another 3 hours :P
Oh.. aw.. okay. I guess I can go skip stones on my own. as.. lonely as that sounds. Have fun with your something or another
You can't.. because your mom wouldn't want you to
I'd like for you to come though
If only. oh well..
haha, don't say that. it's good that she cares. I mean.. it's just me, so you're not missing out on much
of course she does
15 minutes to get there.. and 15 back. Sure, go for it. I guess I should put away my tennis racket . or.. racquet
tennis takes a while to play :P. So I guess.. duck pond?
well.. be safe. see you soon again. although you may have been better off not seeing me :P Because I'm lame
nah. anyway.. see you soon?. if you want. you can always not come 
Well.. only a little while would be cool. Yes?
I thought you left first :P. Okay, the bridge it is. I'll see you soon. If you want
Umm.. how about that climbing tree. just so we both know which one we're talking about
I'll bring one too. we'll look weird together :D
If you meet me at my house then we would have to bike down there together.. whereas we could just skip that and spend more time there
or something
But it's your call. So.. tree it is?
okay, cool (:. Bye for now
thanks (:. I'm sorry though.. for everything
You're welcome
I'm not really :P. but thanks :P. Anyway.. you've probably talked to me enough for once.. . So I should probably leave you alone
I saw you had marshmallow fluff?. add some honey and some.. reese pieces . and boom.. most unhealthy thing ever
haha... I could always break out my pizza dough :P
You have pizza stuffs, right?. :P
Well.. you could.. make some pizza?
You.. should do that!
Pickled pizza :P
Exactly, haha. That actually doesn't sound so bad... I might do it :P. I'm sorry you see me so much.. it's probably my fault. so.. I should let you get to your dinner n' other important stuff. and.. maybe I should get out of your life :P
You're not a failure. You're amazing (:. I really haven't seen you fail at anything. you're just perfect and I love everything about you (:
You didn't though... It's just salt though, right?
Like.. I wouldn't mind if you used my good salt
Does it matter if you were a good doughnut maker?. I thought it was just supposed to be fun (:. and to be with you
How am I qualified?. And.. you can always get practice from it though?
I'm just perfect to you . or something..
nah.. I'm pretty sure it's just you. but I suppose that's all that really matters (:. Because I'm yours . sorry... That's probably not so great
You could've asked for better :P
:/. How could you break my heart?
... I don't think it works that way :/
It's not like my heart it just a piece of bark
Is that all my heart is to you?
Nah, it's just my heart :P. http://youtu.be/NwTsZHGQ6FE. It's.. kinda really funny
haha. ah.. but still.. it's just a heart. it's okay if it's broken, right?
Oh.. that one.. yeah, that one is the important one. Should I be letting you do something?
Both :D. And I guess you could just do it some other time. I'm thinking of making some though :P
nah.. it's just an act for the video. I'm sorry for.. keeping you here. I'm not important, so I don't have to
sorry
haha, yeah (:. you're so amazing (:
Because you are?
Because everything you do is so perfect. And you're so nice. and you're just everything
sorry... You make me want to be a better person just so that I could even be remotely good enough for you
you're sad?
Nah, you're perfect at everything (:. I'd say I'm bad at stuff..
Well maybe one day.. . I gotta prove how amazing you are too . so we could like.. try at the same time o.o. :P
haha. good one :D
You're so perfect (:
I like your everything too (: . And I like you more than that :P. sorry
Very possible (:. Somehow found a way
I know, sorry
or silly :P
I'm fine with crazy so long as I'm with you (:. /silly
You're only love (:. sorry
I haven't either. I guess us together? would be love? . maybe.. that kind of sounds silly
Anyway.. I should let you get to dinner? (:. Sorry, and I should let you do that and stuff. Maybe you could play Tony Hawk and pretend I'm there :P
haha (:
Okay, thank you for the heads up
and thank you for being amazing (:. Everything about you is perfect (:. sorry.. I'll go now. I don't know what the new facebook thing is doing.. so I don't know how to go offline :P. I really like you, Leandra. (: Have a good dinner and a great night (if I can't say it later) sweet dreams (:
Aw.. okay :P. haha "Don't be" cute video (:. Bye (:
You're super duper awesome! :D. Aw.. that's not a creepy ending.. that's just.. sad :'(. anyway.. I won't bother you any longer, I'll just head off
They ripped the paper.. meaning she left or something. Yeah.. that's sad
I watched it. So.. they made one heart?. I would have liked it anyway. but that's cute too (:. Anyway.. I should letcha get to stuffs. Bye (:. (I'm just going to stay online I guess.. because I may be back or something :P). but just so you know.. I'll be gone, but I'll try to stay in your heart (:. Bye
haha, I would like to play at that time.. but I won't be home :/ and you'll always be in my heart too, night. I really wish I could though :/ I would at a later time :P
aw.. I'm sorry :/ I really wish I could have.. it could've been really fun (:
I guess I am? I don't really know though :P Are you?. Oh and I suppose you're right.. tennis two days in a row could've been.. but that's like.. the same with seeing me :P. sorry :P I hope you have a great day (:. Hi
I was.. kind of afraid of ruining your streak
Streak of not talking to me :P. You were doing pretty good
But the streak should be as long as possible! Because then you'd be doing yourself good :P. And I've been okay.. I haven't really done much
Do more what? More nothing?
Umm.. so what do you mean?
I thought you saw me too much already
I'm not doing anything else.. so I suppose I am
I thought you spent too much time with me..
Really? It was her suggestion?
Oh.. . Well...
Let me see if I'd be able to of course
After a lot of convincing. I got a... yes 
nah.. I was kidding about the convincing. I just had to bring up salsa from the basement . and that made me allowed to. as silly as that sounds :P
Burrito night :P. but yeah.. I'd be able to. if you wanted
Doesn't found soon enough :P. sound*. fail on my part. Well, I'll be there as soon as I can . bye for now (:
haha, alright, I'll be sure to be.. slow :P. see ya. I hope that.. you have an amazing time tomorrow and for those days to come (: It sounds like a lot of fun :D Goodnight, sleep well and sweet dreams (:
Don't be sorry for anything, you're amazing (:. And thank you for inviting me over to do such activities, it was really fun (:. Yeah, you're really awesome n' stuff (:
haha. I thought it was a funny goatee . (: You're perfect. But you've got your thing tomorrow, so I should probably letcha get to sleep. so goodnight (: and sweet dreams
Thank you for being amazing (:. You're really something, Leandra (:. Have fun tomorrow!. sorry.. about stuffs... but have an awesome day (:
Well thanks :P I'll try to
yay what? :P
Oh.. sorry. I can go :P since like.. I don't know . Yeah, I don't have to bother you :P
I just ate.. but I can let you get to that
I had chicken :P. You? :P
that doesn't sound like dinner :P 
I did a lot of mowing and weeding. If my lawnmower didn't break I would have had a great time..
It's fixable.. but I had to push it uphill n' stuff
Yeah, it was.. tiresome
but I guess it was okay
if I carry it wouldn't go as straight
It was . but it was alright I guess
I don't know how it could be :P. I really don't have anything planned to make it better :P
not if everyone is busy :P
You would think they'd all be free.. but surprisingly they aren't. oh well :P
It's no matter though
You've seen me so much already.. aren't you bored?. brb 
But like.. you sure you aren't tired of me?. oh.. back by the way
sorry . I kind of smell like.. mowed lawn a lil' bit. so that's probably a deterrent . and like.. I don't know.. I don't want you wasting your time with me.. even though I'd like to.. but still
Well.. you sure?. like.. sure you want to?
I.. don't know. Silly stuffs
Or that :P
Alright, good idea
okay, well.. I'll get some tennis clothing on and meet you.. where?
I was kidding ish
haha, maybe you should :P. I was going to wear like.. athletic stuffs?. or.. I could break out the ol' tennis skirt too
.. yeah I'd feel weird even if you did
Yeah.. that's what I was thinking :P
Where should I meet you?. and when?
Umm.. alright. sounds like a plan
alright, I'll see you then (:. Bye (:
Not at all... I'm a loser 
Nah, I'm a loser. But it was fun nonetheless (:. Thanks for inviting me :D
all I am is a cantaloupe... :P. Why would you want to spend time with.. that?
Whoa... that sounds amazing. you should.. go do that. and I can stop wasting your time. Yeah.. have fun and I can get out of your way
What are you suggesting?
I was thinking of answering that :P
Good idea..
Haha, well.. you should phone a friend and make cones :P. just for ice cream :P
sorry? for what?
It's okay, I like doing stuff with you (:. I thought you had another friend in mind though
haha :P. Well I'd like to make cones with you.. but wouldn't you just want some ice cream now?. sorry
It's so much fun though (:. Like.. I wouldn't know why I wouldn't want to
Fun (:
like I said.. fun :D
I know so (:
of course 
It's fun because of you, not what we do. (:. sorry
Well.. I'll just talk to you some other time then?. Yeah.. I guess goodnight and sweet dreams. Have fun tomorrow and have fun with your ice cream (if you choose to have it)
Oh.. I thought you were just leaving. which was fine
Alone?
There's me?
sorry?
If you'd be mine. (:
Awesome (:. I like you too (:
You're like.. amazing (:
sorry for being silly then
Awesome, have fun with that. I still hope you get some of that ice cream :P
haha. Alright, well.. goodnight then and sweet dreams . Thanks for being the bestest (:
You really really are the bestest
You're amazing, trust me, please?. sorry... I guess you just don't believe me. anyway, I'll letcha get to your stuffs
It's not just that I don't mind.. it's that I love being with you (:
You should just rest fully for school :D
Well, have fun tomorrow in whatever you do (:. You're so so amazing (:
or I'm just plain crazy :P. or amazingly crazy :P
Well.. thanks (:. Means a lot from you. Anyway, goodnight and sleep well (:
(: You mean a lot to me too . I really care about you (:. Sweet rocky road dreams :D
I may come close to believing it (:. Goodnight, Leandra. (:
If I was a rabbit... haha, sorry, bye (:
You're more amazing, tah tah :D
Nah, you're the bestest (:. And you too :D. Bye (:
oh well, that's cool. yeah, good ol' facebook. Goodnight, have fun at school
I'm not good at anything :P bye :D
Or.. not that at all :P. I hope you had a good day
Mine's been pretty boring :P. but that's okay I guess :P
I don't like boring.. but like. I don't know. it wasn't bad?
yeah, that was kinda nice :P. Take as long as you like with the snack
Don't I know it :P
solution: poor it out on the counter. just kidding though :P
haha, well.. whatever works :P
hmm well... sounds like a good idea either way :D
sounds like it. I should.. probably let you get to important stuffs
Anything other than me?
nah. Like I said.. you probably have stuffs to get to, way more important than me.. so I'll let you get to it
My day is looking uneventful. yours?. sorry.. I'll go.. be boring somewhere else
Well I have nothing planned either.. but I'm sure you'll find something. I kind of want to watch 127 hours.. but I don't know where to find it. although.. that's not important
Oh, I wouldn't want to trouble you
I.. don't know.. I don't go over to redbox all that often. I don't know if you'd want to watch it either. and I doubt anyone else I know would either.. . movie for one I suppose :P
Oh, invite yourself whenever, I never mind
Umm.. sounds like fun
You've seen me a lot though. so I don't know how fun it'll be seeing me again
why would it be?
well.. what's required for that game?
sounds like stuff I may be able to get my hands on. I wouldn't know why you'd want to play with me though 
not really, but okay
Or I could walk over for 127 hours
It's on the way though
That's.. absurd. :/. I guess.. there isn't much choice in the matter then
Right.. I guess I wasn't thinking of the circumstances 
well.. darn
So?
If you're able to. I kinda doubt you've asked. and who knows.. you could just get my hopes up
Yes I do
Alright, sounds good.. when should I meet you there?
sounds good. Are you biking?. Because I could too :P. Or umm.. see you soon then?. Umm.. okay?. ... I'll head out then.. bye?
I didn't worry about a single thing the entire way home (: Thank you! The doorknob, however, would not open. Unfortunately I was locked out of my house.. but someone unlocked the door and it was all good :D. those darn doorknobs :P. Thanks again (: I was kinda smiling the entire ride home. sorry.. for things... anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams (:
I accidentally didn't fall asleep right when I got home :P. It's fine though.. Scooby Doo is coming on tonight at 6
Yeah, tonight at 6, the one from yesterday :P
A day late is just as good. I suppose I could watch it. I don't really have anything else to do :P
My day was alright.. I suppose :P. How was yours?
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/memes-cookie-monster-cupcakes.jpg. that made me laugh :P. and your day sounds amazing
People got upset with me.. so I don't know how great that was
Yeah, me too. I liked the 'nailed it'
I mean.. I guess they got over it.. but before.. I made them kinda mad at me
It's so possible.. so possible that it happened. that's how possible it is
Mostly because I can't do anything right and I'm useless
apparently it's completely true :P
Out of anyone you should believe it the most
I was supposed to help them with something.. and by the time I came to help they were already done. so I guess they were mostly disappointed in me
I guess.. but still. They weren't happy
well.. okay
it's okay either way 
Nah, not really. I bet you did.. I mean.. your day involved a horse! It must have been good :D
I didn't really do anything. so that's the not really
unfortunately no
Whoa.. crazy.. I saw like.. 3 cats as I ate cereal :P
haha, thanks for exaggerating my boring life. looking up cupcakes made me want cupcakes :P
I don't have blue icing. but I'm fine without cupcakes :P
Don't have blue food coloring either
haha, it's not necessary . but thank you
Why?. Take as long as you want.. what else could take up your time?
haha, okay:P. :P*. Have fun with cleaning then.. and fun with 'something else' when you find that time :P
I'm not tired of seeing you yet.. I don't think it's possible. but surely you're tired of seeing me..
But no, I love seeing you :D
Not really.. there's nothing better than spending time with you
I already cleaned my room.. so I'm pretty much left with nothing. I have been drawing cats though :P. Anyway, I'll stop taking up your time.. have fun cleaning (:
haha, they're lame :P
Depends.. are you able to afterwards? . And are you allowed to see me? :P
Then yes (:
Oh, alright . Wherever is fine
Yeah, 5:45 sounds fine. I'll see you soon then. have fun, bye (:
Well I was down there.. and it didn't matter.. I don't matter either. I'm just someone taking up space.. and I probably shouldn't be... I'm really really sorry for hanging up on you.. I feel like you fell asleep or something, although I'm not really sure.. so if I just hung up on you I'm really sorry.. but either way I hope you sleep really really well and have some sweet dreams
You did fall a sleep though, right? I'd feel a little better if that were the case :P. I'm still sorry.. I do everything wrong... anyway, have a great day n' all that
Okay, well that's alright.. I am pretty boring, only makes sense that I bored you to sleep :P
probably the only thing nice about me.. :P. anyway, no phones during school hours, right? Don't waste your time talking to me :P
Not that cool :P Just forget about me and enjoy your day
and those docudramas are important, so enjoy it :P  my day, not that it matters, is going fairly poorly.. but like I said.. doesn't matter
I doubt it'll get better.. but it's not too important.. and I don't even think cereal would help.. oh well :P. Yeah, no worries.. have a great day
I like you too (:. But I still don't know about my day :P. I'm sure you'll have an amazing one though :D. sorry for not being near by.. but I guess that just means you won't talk to me . Yeah, I guess goodnight and sweet dreams.. I hope you have a good day tomorrow
Have fun with your movie night! Sounds like fun (: (Would it be Mary Poppins? or was that just random?) You still want to play Slap!? with me? because that'd be really neat. Goodnight, Leandra :D I really really like you too, Leandra. You're amazing! (:. sorry :P. but yeah, sleep well (:
I hardly remember Mary Poppins :P sorry, g'night (:
Maybe she was :P
whoa.. wait.. she did?
well that's really cool. anyway, I'm sure you're busy.. so I'll just bid you a farewell
Sure?. Because I'm not that great... could always make yourself busy :P
haha, but that's no fun
that's hard to believe
Yes
haha, go for it?
beetle 
:D. Hey, Leandra?
You're perfect (:
Nah.. spaghetti is way better than me. You're amazing?. no questionmark*
sorry.. no, You're amazing (:
You're way more amazing
You too (:. Forever isn't a long time when I'm with you (:
As long as I get to spend that time... Sorry.. I won't say it, but you're amazing (:. Goodnight and have a great time tomorrow. I really like you (:. sorry.. bye (:
Haha, okay. See ya (:. You're so so amazing (:
I like yours (:. bye (:. sweet dreams. or.. you know..
That's awesome (:. But I thought you were going to sleep :P. But you know.. oh well
Well.. awesome :D. Goodnight then (:
I like you honey bunches of oats (:
(:. You're amazing! :D. Goodnight (:
You're like the best girl ever (:
Sweet dreams (:
Haha (:. You're amazing (:. Bye 
Okay (:. 11:11. Bye (:
Haha, okay :P. School let out early? or.. something? . Anyway, I'll let you get to your day then
well that's awesome. Have a nice day (:
Okay I will.. (I am up for something :P). sorry.. . I'm surprised you're not tired of me yet.... anyway, have fun with stuffs, I'll see ya around if chance permits 
How is that crazy?. sorry.. I should let you get to your stuffs... Bye
You've got that egg n' stuffs. Yeah, so I'll let you get to your day as I go do stuffs to pass the time or something. So have fun, bye (:. (disappears) :P
Yeah, pretty much
anyway, you probably have things to do.. things to see.. 
Maybe even things to write :P
Haha, maybe like me :P 
But yeah, I have to do something really quick, if you're still around when I get back then cool.. if not then.. oh well :P. bye for now
Mowed earlier this morning :P. you know.. before it got too hot. yeah :P
Yeah.. I moved too
nah, after I mowed. you know.. so that the new owners could have a nice lawn
Yup 
Far away from Blacksburg :P. But what does it matter anyway?
Sorry.. looks like I'm already in Kansas
and once we move past Kansas I can say "Looks like we're not in Kansas anymore"
yeah.. too bad I'm just kidding. :/
Nah.. because if I moved then everyone would be happier
Just an assumption 
nah.. who would be sad?
I didn't wave to anyone yesterday. but you're the most important (:
I'm pretty sure I stayed inside the whole day :P
The pool?. Today?. Didn't the water like.. evaporate or something :P
haha, interesting :P
I haven't been to the pool in forever :P. I'm not even sure I remember how to swim :P
haha. I'd like to see you try :P
not really. just.. I'd like to see you try :D
Probably.. (:
Me too :P
Because.. I'm bad at picking stuff up :P
Whoa.. we have so ...
I was going to say that
haha
Okay.. I'll buy your 3 sodas at like.. the same time :P. What flavors do you want?
Well.. don't be surprised to find soda at your doorstep 
Or.. me.. :P. or.. both o.o
Are you sure there aren't like.. a billion other people you'd want to spend your time with? Especially at the pool?
aw.. I don't have anything in my refrigerator to make a sandwich :/. but neat (:
I don't think I have any peanut butter.. but I was hoping for like.. meat :P. oh well :/
Never have had spam before in my house :P
... nice :P. And that's like.. in my email :P. ... I don't know the difference :P. sorry
yeah, sorry :P
nah.. I'm sorry
Aw.. don't fall. that's no fun :/
it doesn't have to be done.. you're just saying that :P
I think you are
I hope you are
Do you want to?
Of course I want to. What is required for stuffs?
I'm fine with anything. (:
Yeah, I'm fine with "hmm" :P. sorry..
yeah, haha. But yeah.. just spending time with you is amazing in itself . sorry.. if you're busy I can go
You don't have to hang out with me today if you're too busy.. there's always some other time
Plus I'm no fun anyway. so it'll just make your day batter. better*
nah.. I'm pretty lame. but thanks for that comparison. sorry
nah. I find that hard to believe. anyway.. have a great day with whatever you do
I've got nothing planned.. I'm actually pretty disappointed
but it's whatever
I didn't and it's whatever. I'm going to get out of your hair
I want to do something.. you just seem busy and stuff. For a moment you didn't seem like you wanted to..
It's fine.. and yeah.. hard to tell. it's whatever though. I guess I don't have to do anything today.. 
I have some I think
haha.. Mahjong :P. I don't think I have guess who though
I don't either... I have a lot of board games though.. just lying around :P
nah.. not really. I mean.. you know. I don't know. It'd probably be a waste of your time.. when you could be doing important stuffs
I know.. I'm not
nah
I'm just a waste of time though. and I don't know.. you didn't sound like you wanted to earlier.. and I still feel that way. so.. I'm fine with being alone
It's cool.. and I hope yours is too. I just wouldn't want to ruin your day. because I'm a disappointment 
I'm not.. but thanks. yeah.. you probably have better things you could do
I said *better* things
Better things than me
no...
Nah, he's even worse
I'd say he's pretty lame... Nothing special about him
Nah. Pretty sure he's never even seen a taxi
He doesn't even know how to whistle
well.. you can think what you think. I have nothing to get to
Why me though?. It's just me..
Nope.. not really
I mean.. I'm pretty sure it's just not true.. . so you're probably doing a great job
the loch ness monster doesn't exist.. . so that just means you know that it's not true :P
sorry... I feel bothersome... It's just another day right? I doubt seeing me would affect it much
I can forfeit, so you win
it's fair that way too
plus this way you wouldn't need to see me. of course it is..
It's just me.. it's not like it'll affect your day that much. I mean.. I'm just some guy after all
maybe that's how you think.. but right now I don't feel more than that
I want to.. but why would you want to?
doesn't sound like me..
yeah.. pretty recent
I know how lame I am
sure. of course
Umm.. if you want
Umm okay, where would we be going from there?
Umm.. okay. I could just bike over there :P. save you the trouble?
Yeah.. I could just bike alone :P. Unless you really want to bike all the way out here
Well.. more power to you then. it's your choice whether you want to or not. see you in a bit then?
oh umm.. as long as it's what you want and it's not out of your way... I'm fine with you biking out here
I just hope you can in the first place
Let me know if there are any road blocks :P
gotcha. always some other time then
Oh.. okay
I'll bring a flashlight just in case it gets dark. see you in a bit then (:. bye for now. sorry you weren't able to though :P
What?
Oh.. ummm. thought.. never mind. okay
So.. I can't?
I would still like to come
but.. I'm confused and I don't know what you're saying. so.. can I or can I not?
Okay.. I may take a while.. I'm going to run some errands for my mom :P. Like.. they're on the way. but yeah.. see you soon?
I'll see if I can or not. bye for now
awesome (:
Bye (:. or uh.. ttfn. :P
I made it home (: unfortunately I ran a red light in the process.. but I'm safe :D thanks for being amazing (: I'm pretty much the luckiest guy ever (: Goodnight, Leandra and sweet dreams! :D. Have fun tomorrow (:
Thanks for inviting me n' everything it was awesome :D and if mahjong doesn't work out, that would be fine I think.. but it'd be really cool if it does (: anyway.. have a super duper great time :D
yeah, I figured :P Have fun with that though! :D
Well.. there's always some other time, eh?. :P. But I understand, and it's fine.. I'll find something else to do. Have fun (:
And I'll eventually have to go get that :P So no matter what.. I'll have to see you eventually (: anyway.. goodnight and sweet dreams :D. I hope you had a great day (:
You're way cooler :D Good morning n' all and there probably have o.o
what do you mean? Sounds great.. my teacher recommended it to me.. so it can't be so bad, right?
It's great though, right? Goat blood? :D
nah, I'm just kidding :P 
oh, of course :D I.. hope you have a great day (: You're amazing
I heard it's hot outside :P. And nah.. I'm not awesome at all. but yeah... I'm pretty lame, anyway, have a nice day. I guess I shouldn't bother you or anything, so I'm just going to go
Sure I am.. and why be sad you missed me? Not much to miss :P
nah.. not really
I'm here on Sunday :P. what's so cool about that? :P
You talked to me pretty recently
I've been okay
you?
Yeah :P
nothing better but to stay inside and listen to a storm :P
I was going to say that too
Yeah.. too bad. it's good for you though.. that means you can play (:
I'd want to. but like.. it's such short notice and I doubt your mother would approve. Plus.. I was just in the rain :P
Of course.. it means that I'm wet and able to get wet again :P
hmm.. maybe I should change to dry clothes :P
exactly :P
why would you want to see me though?
umm okay?
I was going to say "we don't have to, there's always tomorrow". because you know.. I'm just me...
haha, good point
plus I'm no fun to begin with :P
well maybe you could do that today?. because that'd be a better use of your time :P
seeing me isn't a good use of time at all. and speaking of.. I gotta brb really really quick
Not really.. fun, but I'll try to do it really quickly. unless you're gone by the time I get back
okay.. back
That they do
may only be pokemon
haha, awesome
haha, okay. sounds awesome. sorry, but.. are you tired of talking to me?
Yeah.. I'm pretty tired of talking to myself. :p
it's cool. and yes :P
mostly likely insanity. most*. sorry.. failure on my part
yeah. still.. I failed :P
Oh umm.. awesome. have fun with that. I'll just be.. here :P
I'll be here at my house
I'll try to have fun with.. the nothing I've got. And I bet that smells amazing (:
Nah, haha.. I'm fine without it
I don't have any around over here :P
They're in my house.. just not around here
sure.. haha
anyway.. I'll stop keeping you here.. and I'll let you get on with your stuffs
you were supposed to start Monday :P
haha, awesome. I'm still curious as to what you're making. but.. I'll let you get to your stuffs
I'll see? Well I can't wait :P. and neat. anyway, have fun with stuffs
I believe in you. You're amazing and I think you could do it without a mix (:
Well.. good point. and I'll try to.. I don't have much to do though. and you too
yeah.. well.. I'll be fine alone :D. have a great rest of everything today! (:
nah.. no cats. but yeah, have fun with muffins
Bye, you're amazing (:. sorry..
Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I think the same about you 
It's only 10:09. And I'm working on my story
It's 10:11 here :P
Yeah.. but that can't be what's happening :P. there were some roadblocks for my story.. 
but yeah, see you hopefully, but it's just me.. so if it doesn't happen it's nothing :P. Anyway, I'm sure your story is going well also. goodnight (: sleep well
You're amazing (: Sweet dreams
Whoa.. monday and jello :P
sounds crazy.. but crazy amazing, of course
what other kind of crazy is there?
Exactly (:
Probably.. like.. whole grain and cranberry?. :P
I may be possibly free. I don't know though :P. I would like to be (:
I hope I am as well. There's a healthy lemon-blueberry scone recipe :P. sorry.. I looked it up :P
I know :D 
Does not call for that. And I'm pretty sure ice doesn't call for that either
Yeah, don't want to mess up on frozen water. You should like.. garnish it just in case.. make it look fancy. just kidding.. of course. but :D
Sounds plausible . :P
Like you (:
haha, nah, you. 're amazing*. sorry :P
I would, would you like me to?
Nah, it's just me :P
that's the lame part
nah, I'm so so lame. (:
that's a lot of 'so's
sure I can :P
nah, can't mess with him... so you know.. I don't. but the 'so's can't kill me.. 
I think so
Yeah, they could get angry and prove me wrong.. and then what'll we do?
aw.. that reminds me. the season is almost over
Scooby Doo
Nope.. you jumped in at the second to last episode. tomorrow will be the last one
Yeah, for now. but now I'll have to wait :P. And the wait is the hardest part
haha.. sounds thrilling
I'm waiting on nothing :P
Oh, maybe I should go ask
I am free (:. oh okay.. you're gone, my bad
I'd feel bad just showing up if like.. you know you didn't know
Well more like.. ya know... if you didn't. I don't know. I'm just being silly. Am I even allowed over?
They are. the healthy scones actually sound good
that's what you need.. so.... I can print it out, just need to know if I need to bring anything just in case :P
like.. chilled as in you take it from the refrigerator 
Yeah.. and you may get your hands a little.. messy
because you have to get into that dough
Only if you want to make cool shapes, but it's not required
12:20 sounds like a good time
If I'm there later than that.. I do apologize ahead of time
okay, well.. see you soon then (:
Thank you for wanting to see me today :P You're really really amazing and cool (: Goodnight and sweet dreams (:
Don't be sorry.. I haven't any mahjong skills either and I hugged you too.. so.. I don't know, sorry too? Still, you're amazing (:. And if that offer of ice blocking were to still stand, I'd say it sounds like fun.. but I understand if something else comes up
Well, I think you're everything (: and I bet it'd be awesome just by being with you (:  anyway, goodnight. sorry.. I hope you have a great day today (:
I've been sort of unlucky so far.. so I'm kinda scared for the rest of my day :P
I had to do something :P. and things went poorly. But it doesn't really matter. I was away, by the way.. so I'm sorry
I would. but I'd have to be somewhere at 3:45 . so.. I'm free now and after that. which is.. weird. I dunno.. sorry
yeah.. sorry. I don't know what you want :P. sorry. I'll shut up, you seem busy.. . or something..
I don't know... But yeah.. I'll leave you to your strings then. seems important
And after 4 :P. that's when I'm free :P
It's just me though.. so you know.. 
Umm, okay
okay
wow what?. wait.. sorry. I don't know
oh... okay
Gotcha. Well.. you know, you just saw me yesterday.. 
I don't know.. I'd think you'd be tired of me
yeah, somehow... I don't know.. I have after 4.. unless you're busy then
Well.. there's always some other time.. I guess
I'm not that important anyway
nah.. not at all. Which is silly.. because you could be spending your time with better things
I said better things..
Yeah.. you should just.. have fun with your day
nah.. I've got nothing to do
You wouldn't want me there..
I'd just ruin your day. You could have way more fun without me
I'd want to... Just.. I don't know.. I feel like I'd just waste your time
You could always make something planned?
Why me?. I'm lame
I mean.. I want to.. but I just feel like a waste of time
I could only be there for about an hour or so. that couldn't be any fun..
well.. okay. if you want ot. to*
Nah, I want to too
I just don't want to be.. I don't know..
Boring and unsafe? no way they go together :P
Unless I was some daredevil and unsafe stuff just was boring from experience. so like.. safe stuff would become thrilling
Yes I do
I think I'll walk just so I don't get stuck in traffic on my bike :P
I mean.. I was outside recently and there were so many cars :P
so you'd be surprised
Exactly
anyway.. I'll see you soon. bye
will do
exactly..
Thanks.. good luck with your thingy :P (it was boring though, you made it super fun :D ). Oh, hey.. new scooby doo on tonight... I think I found the only thing to look forward to :P
I'm not really awesome.. you are though (:. Nothing you should be thankful though... anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams (:
I'm sorry.. there's not much to miss though
I'm really now :P. not*. anyway.. I hope you have a nice day in whatever you do
yeah :p. I'll try to have a nice day.. not sure what to do. but yeah.. enjoy the day
Okay, I'll go mystery walk :P
Who would want to go with me?. I think I'll just have to go alone
nah.. maybe just you :P. But even then.. why would you want to?
You see me all the time. I'm surprised you would still want to
I'll just give it a little longer.. it'll get old soon enough
just a little longer. :P
yup
yup, one way :P. which way is that again?
thought it was left :P my bad. anyway, I'm sure you're busy... so I'll let you get to your day
I should be and I could never get tired of you. and if your day is almost over then you should like.. spend it well and not talking to some lame person
doesn't make sense . Because it's me.. and I'm lame
always
Nah.. I'm not cool
nope.. just you
good point..
haha, when don't you?
You're amazing all the time though
nah, just you (:
I think you're pretty perfect (:
Nah, all you (:. You're the most amazing person I've ever met
It's absolutely true though (:
okay... awesome
that makes them even better
darn. Just have to watch the adventure time :P
On tv?
So.. it has cake, waffles, butter, eggplant, half an apple, a few tacos, a pumpkin, beans, a tomato, a banana, a stack of pancakes, a loaf of bread, a grape fruit, an orange, banana bread, a turkey, a pink frosted donut, a pretzel, a carrot, a slice of ham, a bowl of cereal, a cup, an egg, a hamburger, 2 sandwiches, a hotdog, milk, bacon, a strawberry, a carton of eggs, rice, a pineapple, popcorn, and grapes. oh.. and a slice of lemon
It'd probably be hard to make.. but I'd like to. oh and just a cup..
nice profile picture, by the way
I mean, you just put up a new one.. so it's not too random
wait.. what?. It's been that way for a month?
okay.. well.. I'll just go then and feel stupid...
yeah.. okay.. . Bye I guess. You're probably busy anyway
"not exactly" just means that you are.. you just don't want to be? . I dunno.. actually. but yeah.. anything is better than talking to me
no way.. . I'm not as good as cake..
nah.. I'll just.. let you get on with important stuffs
I am.. . but why waste your time with me?
nope.. I'm not . I'm just some guy who wastes your time on a regular basis
I don't know if I can. as far as I'm concerned I'm still that quiet kid people just saw and ignored..
Show it how? By picture? . I'd like to see it happen..
not really.. but thanks. anyway, I'll stop wasting your time
It doesn't sound silly.. . how early do I have to get out there?
sounds good
anything with you sounds amazing. but anything with me, however.... probably doesn't sound fun at all
I don't know.. maybe you're just being nice?
sounds silly..
It does
umm.. I'm lost
yeah...
Me neither
yup
yeah, me too :P
awesome.. . sounds amazing
yup. I'll let you get to that..
Well.. enjoy skittles then,,. ..*
yeah.. enjoy that then. anything is better than me
everything other than cake
I doubt that
I don't know if I can believe that.. 
okay... Well.. I'll let you get to stuff. I'll just go.. do something. I've got a ripstick I could use..
I'm not cool... last time I was on a ripstick :P
no just.. making a comment about it. not important... it was a long story and I may have told you.. but if I haven't I doubt you'd care. Anyway.. I think I'll go break something on my ripstick
weird...
you'd be surprised..
anyway.. maybe I could break my heart while I'm at it
sorry..
Yeah, I'll just go
I really do
yup.. anyway.. I'll get to it
hurting myself... breaking stuffs
nah.. it's not like I matter anyway. and have fun taking the trash out
I don't know.. I just don't think I matter. and I should be gone by the time you come back.. because if I'm not I could waste your time more..
sure I do.. and I doubt there's a picture out there that could make me feel differently
I'm not amazing though.. so no photo like that exists
nope
sorry for what?
okay.. well I can't wait either
Bikes sound nice. I don't know where we'd meet though
okay. sounds nice
oh yeah, that comes on at 10 tonight
yeah :P
haha, okay. going to watch it?
hulu! :P. or.. anything else.. it's in a lot of places on the web. even syfy.com has it
yeah.. . I don't know if it'll get on right away at 10.. but it'll be there eventually. can always sneak over to Squires and steal the cable there :P
That's why I said *sneak* over
quick.. make some out of paper
they returned to the old bags. less noisy 
yeah.. just don't have that and you'll be good. my skittles are.. tasty
yeah.. I have some. :P. sorry.. random. anyway.. I should let you get to stuffs
yeah... and I'm not amazing. bye though. have fun with your quest to watch Legend Quest. and with other things you do
It's not true.. so I don't know if I can believe it. good luck trying though. have fun with everything
sounds great. because I can and want to. Don't know why you'd want to though
It's fine, I like seeing you and talking to you and being close too.. . I pretty much like you
now that's just crazy talk
But it's the everything burrito. It's way better than me. I mean.. it has everything
nah.. I'm just cheesy
I'm not, but you are (:
You're way cooler. have fun with stuffs
I do know them
sorry
I'd say so :P
I like After Hours
Yeah, it's nice too
no productivity here :P
I've actually nothing to do. but thanks..
Nothing at all. and there's not really anything to do... I'm sort of just waiting on Legend Quest. which is.. sad in a way :P
Paper mache?
well have fun with it... I'm going to be bored for about 3 hours
there really isn't anything..
anyway.. I probably shouldn't keep you any longer than you have.. so I guess... bye
sounds unlikely 
(I won't do any of that stuffs.. and I'll probably miss legend quest). but thanks.... bye. Goodnight and sweet dreams if I miss the chance to say it later
yeah.. I always could... anyway, have  a great rest of your day
I'm not.. but I think you are.. if that accounts for anything
and I like you a bunch too. not accounts.. amounts* . sorry.. I'm a failure
Bye.. you're amazing. sorry
one day.... maybe. bye bye
Goodnight, Leandra. (: See you today :P
See you soon, actually.. well.. if you still want to
okay, awesome (:
awesome, see you then (:
(:. Goodnight (or should I say morning?) and sweet dreams (:. Sleep really really really well (:
Hello there
It's me :P
Don't be.. it was nice (:
haha, yeah :P
You. should. do. it! (:
Haha, I'm glad that I can do that for you :P
Sorry.. I just got done mowing it :P. And it's really hot outside :P
You seemed busy.. and you weren't online.. so like.. I sort of went mowing . And I was about to say.. "it's really hot outside, should go to the pool or something"
Umm.. well, I'm sweating because it's hot outside . and I may have another lawn to mow.. but I don't really know. but I guess.. it's looking warm?. you?
Nice (:. Possibilities are always fun. and if you go to the pool, have fun (:. Make sure to like.. cannonball for me :D
Well I'd go with you.. but I'm sure you've grown tired of me by now 
that's crazy..
ice cream by the pool?!?. :P. sorry.. 
Drinking ice cream is just as fun :D
true.. but it still tastes amazing (:
Awesome
Why are you sorry?. Yesterday was amazing (:. If anyone should be sorry it should be me :P. I mean, you're amazing (:
There was a movie on, it was no problem. Other than the fact it like.. made me sleepy too. I tried really hard not to fall asleep on you :P
You were asleep, I doubt you would have noticed
sushi cat was a bit random :P. And I still don't believe that I'm awesome, sorry
That sushi cat was kinda lame.. I mean, it fell apart like as soon as you got it
I could say the same about you (:
it's not true if you said it :P. but okay, have fun with lunch :D
I might get heat stroke.. it's so hot outside. oh, I still gotta give you that soda, don't I?. sorry, random.. . I'll just let ya get to stuffs, bye bye
sorry. and I can't wait for later then :P and I'll do it.. one of these days :P. I sort of meant "I can"* wait for later :P. sorry. Anyway, have a great day. I'll uh.. stop bothering you
sorry. Sometime soon. trust me. :P
sorry..
WHOA!. That's.. crazy. Gotta like.. make a cheesecake specifically for that day :P
! that would be awesome (:
That's exciting (:
Anyway, I hope you have an amazing day. I gotta mow some more. Bye (:
If only I had one :P but it might have been a false alarm. but yeah, still hope that everything you do is super amazing :D. Fixing refrigerators n' paper mache n' what not :D. if you do that stuffs of course :P. Now would be a good time if you wanted some like.. mystery soda.... or something. just saying :P I mean, it may not be a good flavor.. and it could have gotten a bit shaken... but you know, it's there and you can always add ice :D. sorry... sorry.. it was a bad idea :/ I'll stop bothering you.. maybe even stop talking to you because I'm just a waste of time and I'm dumb... sorry.. I hope your day was good and that you have a good night.. and I'll shut up now
Good morning, Leandra. I'm sorry about my message.. I just felt like it was a bad idea :P but thanks for liking it? But yeah, cheesecake sounds like fun :D
haha, yeah, Happy National Cheesecake Day :D
I am so up for it, I don't know how good I could be at it though
Well that's good :D
:D. Awesome. both awesome! . And you're awesome too (:
sorry
I.. think I should go ask. just to know
sorry... but.. I am available today
haha, that's silly :P
yeah, I know
You're way more awesome (:
Whenever you'd like me to?
That sounds good (:
So.. I'll see you soon then?
Awesome (:. Me too
which one?. first or second?
yes
okay, will do :D. Bye for now
haha, awesome. :D
exactly! :D
Awesome, see you then (:
You're welcome.. I don't see how it's cool of me though :P. But you're way cooler! and amazing (:. thanks for letting me help n' stuff. Have a great night, sleep well and sweet dreams (:
I actually did run into a skunk . and I slipped on my pedals.. and I may have broken my bike seat 
I love being with you too (:
Yeah, I'm okay. thanks (:. Goodnight (:
I really really like you too (:. And everything (:
Bye, Leandra :D
Have a great day tomorrow. and fun (:
And rainy. :P. Slipping on my bike was scary. I thought I was going to die :P. but yeah, tah tah for now (:. You're amazing . Night (:
I like you too (:
Bye (:
haha, okay. Sleep well 
You're still way cooler than I am :P. see ya around. sorry, about that.. but I hope you're having an awesome day (:
Whoa.. me too. but, yeah.. have fun (:
Yeah, very close to my house :P and you're cooler
yeah.. or just inside it :P
I would hope so.. I just told you :P
that would be unfortunate... then you could forget about me 
okay.. :P. I'm not that great to remember though :P
no way, you're amazing. I'm just some guy
nah, not really... but thanks
I like you too, but I wouldn't say I'm sorry about it
that it is. and I don't know why I'd think otherwise . thunder :P. you almost had an entire day that didn't involve me.. how about that :P. sorry...
It's just not true..
it's silly... I'm just some guy and talking to me can't be too fun
I would doubt it
I can talk to myself fine. :P. but yeah, I'm lame.. and I can let you get on with your day 
You're still more amazing. and my day was just church and home.. pretty much. My sister thought she saw you in yellow on the way home though. that.. could be cool.. but I didn't get to see you :/. But that's about it.. how was your day?
Sounds awesome (:. And it's crazy that it was you.. I wish I had seen you
Sounds awesome. Makes mine sound boring..
I don't know what that is... sorry
and I haven't done anything cool today
sounds lame to me :P. And that game is pretty fun. I like the nas spin. if that's what it is called
Yeah, Andy used to own it. I wasn't that great at the time.. so he made fun of me
nah, I had to redeem myself :P. but by the time I got better he sold the game. oh well :P. anyway, I'm sure you've got cool stuffs you could do. I don't really have much, but I don't want to waste your time
if only :P
I had hiccups today for the longest time.. it got painful :/
crazy. I kinda wanna go on a bike ride.. but it could rain.. but I don't like being stuck doing nothing. sorry. I'm sure you've got cool stuffs to do though
!! you should do more :D. It'll take longer if you don't work on it :P. I mean, you're wasting your time talking to me... I still wish I could help by the way
speaking of bike ride... I need to fix my seat. because I broke it last night. and I wish you could come.. but you're far too busy
you've got your thingy to work on :P. and I should be able to fix it alone.. so no need to worry about it
Oh.. it just needs to be loosened then tightened again. because it's out of alignment . but yeah, I doubt you could even if you wanted to. seeing how late it is..
go for it, but I doubt that you'd be allowed 
well.. I could fix my bike and meet you there if you wanted. but I don't know how fun that could be
yeah, I'm going to go on a bike ride regardless.. . so I guess there is another time
Don't know why you'd want to hang out with me then either. Yeah.. a bike ride today. just to make sure my seat works :P. ya know.. test ride
I was going to go out to the hand n' hand. but it's probably just a waste of time for you. but I suppose I'm going to fix my seat now.. so have fun in whatever you decide. bye for now
if you want.. . I'm going to fix the seat now though. so.. I guess I'll see you if I see you
bye
okay.. 15 minutes and I'll be over there then. bye. don't worry about main street.. I'll just drop by, if that's okay. yeah.. I'll just.. go now. bye
Thank you (: Goodnight and sweet dreams! Don't stumble on your way to your bed :D. I saw like.. two bunnies on my way back.. and they were all like 'nose twitch' to me.. so I did it back :D I think it's like.. hello or something (:. .. sorry :P anyway, sleep well! And sleep in if you want :D it could be neat the kind of dreams you see :P 
Sorry for not letting you sleep
I would have let you fall asleep on me.. but I don't know how your mom would have felt about that
we. should go camping! kidding.. of course :P. but you were comfy too (:. And warm. I would have liked to stay. if that.. was alright :P. sorry.. I should just let you sleep. Goodnight, Leandra (:
That would be fun (:
that could be fun too 
What could you be sorry for?. You're amazing. and perfect (:
Don't be (:. You're way more amazing (:. Like.. I don't think I'm that amazing at all... thank you (:. I should like.. get ahold of a tent some time :P
I like you bunches too (:
You're way more awesome (:. You're like.. the bestest person ever (:. Bye, Leandra. Sleep really well :D
aw (: You're my bestest friend too . Sweet dreams (:
I like you too (:. Bye for now :D
What did I say about sleeping in? :P sorry.. and if I was mowing today, I would let you join me.. still not sure of how fun it would be :P. Sorry.. for everything, anyway.. I hope you have a great day (:. Yeah, I hope you have lots of fun :D. sorry.. I can shut up :P
I'm so so so lame :P You're awesome :D and that's cool, at least you didn't have anything to do, right?. but yeah, have a great day with anything you do (:. I guess I'm going to find something to do, sorry :p not that it mattered anyway 
no way I'm perfect :P. But you way are (:
well.. it's not 100% :P. haha, kidding.. sorry. I think you're perfect. and you're way up there 
and I'm not :P
Nah, I don't deserve it
I can just make another :P. just let them eat it all :P
I wouldn't.. but if I don't like.. make sure it gets in here.. it could get nasty :P. plus if you were out here, I'd want to see you
assuming you're the mysterious person 
doorbell doesn't work :P
sounds like a silly thing to do. you don't have to
it's just cheesecake 
okay. have fun :D
awesome :D. but you really don't have to do anything. it's silly
nah. it's silly. plus you could drop by when like.. I don't notice, then I wouldn't be able to see you or anything. and.. brb
back
and it sounds out of your way
it's really not necessary 
and with the cheesecake at the same time?. that would be a silly coincidence . you shouldn't worry about it and just enjoy your day
Did you unlock Kona without me?
oh, sorry 
shucks :P
you don't have to wait on me.. you can just do it :P
and that sounds awesome, I wish I could go :P. but nah, unlock kona and play thugs without me. It's silly to wait
that's silly
and I've always wanted to go to a reenactment . :P. And kona is just a skatepark . like.. it's an actual skate park, instead of being a place that somehow has ramps
probably.. oh well. I guess I'll just never get to go to one
I would be interested.. but you're right about church, and if I did get out of going that day, you probably wouldn't want me there. oh, and it looks like I have a two person tent somewhere :P. random, sorry. umm.. I should probably let you get on with your day.. I'm thinking about going on a bike ride.. maybe skip some stones. I doubt I'd go on one though :P
Yeah, I can go camping alone :P. and it'd probably be too much work, so I don't have to go :P
It'll just be in my yard.. I should be safe
but yeah, let you get to your day.. I should do that . and alone in the tent is probably all I could do. umm.. have a good rest of your day ):. (: *
I'll have a blanket.. I should be fine
I guess they'll kill me :P. but what does that matter?. I should stop wasting your time still, so have fun with stuffs
haha, okay..
not really..
Yeah.. I was going to bike over there. alone, haha :P. If you were implying that you'd also like to do such.. then awesome. but as of now I'll have to go alone
crazy.. I'm sure you've got something better to do. brb. back
crazy. I didn't even think you'd want to. or at least I don't know why you'd want to
I mean, I was going to be alone otherwise . and I love seeing you. but yeah, if you want to.. I'll be out there by a nice tree that houses three (rhymes?. )*
Oh, sure.. that should be fine :P
okay, neat. see you soon, bye (:
Thank you for biking with me (: and thank you for being perfect and the bestest (: I really and truly like you so so so much, thanks again (:. and sorry for getting you home so late.. that was bad of me :/. Goodnight and sweet dreams, you're amazing (:. sorry.. for stuffs :P
Have a great day (: it may sound silly.. but I'm sleepy :P
I'll try.. I don't really have much going for my day though.. I guess I can watch tv? I dunno.. sorry, yeah, you should have loads of fun :D. My head's full of doubt But my heart's full of love When the words come out Would it be enough?  Or will I run out of time Just to say the line. that.. was not meant to be sent.. so I am very very very very sorry. I'm just going to go.. hide away in a hole now... or something
hello there
nothing, really :P. you?
I didn't
unfortunately. and that sounds really cool (:
haha, that would be sweet
I didn't mean to send it.. it's bad
silly
nah, it's whatever.. I just feel silly for sending it. still sorry :P
I wish.. I had something to do today :P. I'm thinking of making some sketches or something
not really... I've got nothing much to do
oh, that's always fun.. but usually fun with someone :P
aww.. I broke your standing man :/
haha, maybe :P. I probably shouldn't bother you as you do your jewelry thing :P
I suppose I like pools :P. do you like pools?
of course. (:
whoa.. just what I was thinking :D
awesome :P. sorry
that they do :P
it's more like.. x-men. you need to see that movie :P. well.. you don't need to.. but still. you should watch it :D. I'd watch it with you :P
yeah, like.. the beginning
yup
Cowboys vs. Aliens could be good. but I haven't seen that :P
exactly :D. You need to see Indiana Jones and Star Wars too :P. if I recall correctly :P
I wish I remembered all the Indiana Jones I've seen. :P
yeah, I can always re-watch them all :P
I should do that today :P. since I've got nothing else :/
I don't know.. I'm just sort of bored...
which is whatever I guess. I can always bike somewhere or something
like in Kona?. just kidding.. :P. A pool sounds nice.. but silly to want me there :P
I'd probably lose it :P. but a pool sounds cool
exactly
yups :P. sorry
awesome. You should go do that
I was thinking that. but I didn't want to put it down :P
and?. It'd be cool anyway. :D
probably went outside and saw a caterpillar 
exactly :D
it's like you're making the poem right now :P. I should.. probably let you get on with your day.. I'm lame 
you're so amazing, why would you want to wast your time with me?. I would want to.. but I'm lame. waste*
I fail.. all the time. nah, you're so amazing (:
you saw me yesterday, I doubt you'd want to see me again 
very silly. and hard to believe. sorry..
so sorry...
nah, I'm not. not really.... I'm really lame
it's impossible
Well.. I'd like to see you try.. but I really doubt it
if you can :P. .. :P. You should get a prize if you can :P
Fine.. if you can't do it.. then you can get a consolation prize :P
Umm.. I don't know, what would you like as your consolation prize?
I can.. see if I can make that happen
darn. what's the bestest thing ever that you've always wanted and it's all like.. so cool n' stuff?. And you're just like: "Hey, I want that.. it's awesome" :P
no, you already have me. so it has to be something else. plus I'm not even that great 
Yeah, I've been yours for a while now :P. sorry :P
no.. what's crazy is wanting me :P
because.. I'm lame :P
yup... I guess you'll have to settle for the consolation prize. just sayin' :P
let me know if you figure out how you could :P. I should probably let you go to the pool, because you sounded like you wanted to go.. and I'm no fun.. so swimming with me wouldn't be fun either :P
well I can do anything anywhere... :P
:P
well.. so far I'm doodling. and that's all I've planned so far
just random stuffs. nothing in particular 
yeah :P. I suppose they are. sorry.. . I can let you go if you have stuff to do..
well.. sorry then?. You just weren't.. saying anything.. I thought you left
You don't have to..
hmm.. maybe :P
if you want to
all of those options sound amazing. I don't know which one to choose
sounds awesome (:
I don't know why'd you want to do that stuffs with me though. but it all sounds like fun (:. sorry
silly...
that's silly too. but I'd love to do stuffs with you today. like.. whatever is fine :D. unless you've changed your mind.. which is okay too
neat (:
I do. sure you want to?
neat :D
nah, I've changed my mind in the last two seconds. just kidding, it'd be silly if I changed my mind :P
good point.. but I'm not *that* indecisive . what is "required" for 'stuffs'?
okay.. so no pool then?. that's okay.. :P. but that sounds like fun (:
There's always some other time for the pool :P. When should I pop on by?
I like your.. everything (:. And that sounds fine
yeah, see you soon :D. bye. You're amazing, thank you for everything (:. Goodnight and sweet dreams (:. sorry.. :P  sleep well :D
You too, I hope your day is amazing (:. I get to help clean at my church today :P Doubt it'll be fun, but I guess it's better than nothing :D Anyway, have fun with everything you do (:. :P. Hey, that wasn't that bad :P . sorry.. . I hope you had a great day :D I know I didn't
sounds awesome. And to think.. I thought you were going to go the entire day without anything to do with me :P
nice
it wasn't that great.. to be completely honest... but I'm sure you had an amazing day. and I wouldn't want to ruin it
Well I just got home recently.. and I did a bunch of stuff.. I'm tired and I don't know. I just.. didn't get to do anything fun
is adventure time even on?
nah, gots none. :P. oh well. I should probably just let you get to bed, huh?
beds aren't silly. and you're way more amazing
so amazing (:
no, I mean you :D. One hundred percent (:
But you're still way more amazing (:
Nope. not exciting at all..
I don't know where practice is.. and it was.. sweaty
I'm guessing it's at the middle school. but they didn't really tell me. I mean, practice changes places time to time. today was at pandapas pond
Yeah :P. it was tiresome . and then I had to help clean up. and then I had to mow. and then move rubbish . and now I'm home. yeah//. ..*. sorry.... I should.. letcha get to bed or something..
yeah.. I didn't really like it. and that was my entire day. no fun :P. but I guess I can't complain.... but I still do :P
I'll let you know the next time I mow
I haven't had any of it yet. and have fun with your ovaltine.. I should probably stop wasting your time
that's silly..
I'm not awesome.. I'm so lame. and I know it is..
crazy. I was unaware
crazy
So crazy
Whoa!. I wish I had one :P
I don't have one :/. Thanks for reminding me... and I'm not. Enjoy the ovaltine, you should have fun doing stuffs :P. instead of talking to boring ol' me
nah. no way
I won't be running tomorrow... Orthodontist appointment . and I went there too... so.. I'll probably run after that.. or at least go on a bike ride. anyway, have a good day tomorrow.. I should stop being lame/ a bother. I have to make a cardboard dinosaur head and then paper mache it. :P
it's not..
just to go by it :P. and.. yay? :P. sorry
yup :P. sorry.. I should stop being lame... but it's hard not to be :P
me too :P. I may need help with it.. but I might be able to manage it all
nah... sorry..
nah.. it's going to be lame. but I probably need to work on it as soon as possible (not now of course.. but soon). sigh.. I should probably let you get some sleep. I'm boring anyway. or at the very lease I should just let you be.. there are probably better people online.... yeah.. I'll just.. go then. Goodnight and sweet dreams. have a great day tomorrow. sigh :/
.. no need to be sorry..
It doesn't matter I guess... Why care, huh?. It's just me.... I can just.. leave you with whatever.. you seem pretty busy
yeah.. you should just sleep. and it looks like I missed Legend Quest... but I guess that doesn't matter
But mostly I don't matter. I don't.. I told you, I don't have practice tomorrow
but hey, don't listen to me.. . I'm just some guy. and yeah, I understand that you missed it.. . but I was sort of talking to you, but I guess that didn't really work out. anyway.. I'll just let you go then...
I feel like it... I guess that'll be what I have to do
yeah... anyway
I should probably go- feel worthless somewhere else
you should make one :P. bye..
yeah.. okay. goodnight then..
I don't.. . I hate everything about me :/. sorry.. worthless somewhere else.. my bad
nope..
I'm not amazing.. I'm just.. me
not at all... :/. sorry..
good luck with that.. I really doubt it
yeah...
I don't think it'll work
we'll see.....
as of now, however, I feel like dying.. so- goodnight and sweet dreams
nah, couldn't be the worst thing ever
nah.. I'm pretty sure I'm the worst thing ever. and to stop bothering you.. I'm just going to go
nah.. not really
it's way better. sorry.... g'night
Anything is better than me..
bye
you're sweet. sorry... anything**
you're perfect, not me
nope, you're so perfect. I'm so lucky that you even talk to me. anyway, I shouldn't bother you any longer.. goodnight n' sweet dreams
no way, I'm the luckiest. I don't know.. being one of the awesomest persons ever just means that I'm just at the bottom of the rest of thems
the maybe.. means that it's not silly. sorry..
to be honest it's just got worse and worse. gotten*
nah..
probably just make things worse... anyway.. I'll just go..
crazy... yeah.. shark week :P
you should do it.... and have fun. goodnight
I wasn't sure what you were implying.. . so... I don't know. It wouldn't be any fun with me.. but I feel like someone would watch it with you
I do know how amazing I am. very little :P. and I'd like to watch it with you.. but I'm still lame. anyway, I should stop wasting your time. so.. goodnight and sweet dreams
fine.. just a little
just the orthodontist appointment.. and a run alone. that's about it
that's silly. but I'll be sure to find the tiem. time*. thyme* :D. sorry.. bad of me. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams. hopefully I can see you tomorrow
who doesn't?
that's a silly dream :P. anyway, sleep well
Goodnight, Leandra
you too. and you are too 
sorry... bye
aw man, no sticker :/ but it was okay anyway.. I hope your day is great (:. whoa.. like.. sent at the same time :P
umm... 10 1/2. I.. had to take my shoe off to know that :P
haha, kind of a random question :P
haha, okay. I hope your day is going well
I'm not. I guess you're probably busy. so I should let you get to stuffs
Exactly.. you've got stuffs to do. and I'm sorry for that :P
Well.. I'm free. but you don't have to
Not reallu. really*. but you could
Well that sounds like fun
I should let you get to that stuffs and then eventually we could maybe do something. I'm no fun :P
Me too
umm.. okay?. Have fun doing stuffs
haha
I haven't
anyway, don't let me be in the way
Bye then
Nah.. you are though
that's silly. bye bye for now. Have the most fun ever
I like you so much too (:. sorry..
yay for what? :P
oh, neat. sorry... :P. but hey (:
How are you?
yeah, it's crazy :P. I hope your day is going well
I'm okay I guess
yes :P
possibly :P. it sounds pretty tasty :P. I don't have one unfortunately.. 
lucky..
nah, that's silly. I couldn't ask that of you
crazy..
you probably should have thought about that :P
I am still possibly free somehow
not really :P
that's silly. stuffs with me is just as fun with anyone else
I make no difference
no. just kidding, of course I do (:
haha, okay
haha
umm.. spend time with you (:. sorry..
sorry..
You're cute (:. What did you want to do?
so..? We could go skip stones and whatnot?. Or what?
are you taking me out of the equation?
oh, crazy. but that sounds nice. If I can make it there in one piece :P. but whatever you want to do, I would like to too
crashing :P
yeah :P. sorry.. sure you'd even want to?
okay. should I go ahead and make it over there though?
wait.. hmm?
okay. sorry then?. I don't know... I was talking about the duck pond.. or something. but if you can't do anything, that's fine..
sorry?
Probably not.. but I'll be sure to love it :D
awesome :D. so.. should I meet you there?
Yeah, I'll just meet you there. see you soon?. umm.. okay. I'll just.. be over there then
it officially hasn't now. you're way more amazing. but yeah.. once I got home.. it officially didn't come true. which is.. okay I guess. it wasn't important. yeah :P. Sorry.. for everything
I'm not. the wish was a terrible thing to wish for
I should have wished for like.. a world peace. but I didn't..
I wished for what I wished for.. and it was terrible of me. I'm an awful person. and it'll never happen. and I guess that's okay. it wasn't too important
I specified with "tonight" in the wish.. so like.. it's pretty much long and gone
no, it's not your fault
it would be the same.
and I guess it wasn't special..
go for it
yup. that was it
yeah..
oh.. not the wish :P. but that would have been a good one
not amazing at all. I wished you'd realize that I wasn't amazing. just kidding... but still... I'm not
It's cool. and you're way more amazing. I feel bad for the wish though. because.. at the time.. I was like.. it'd be nice if it happened.. but I know it's not a good wish
or a good thing. it wasn't
you wouldn't say that if you knew the wish
K Jewelers is a hint
sure..
the slogan. sure
yes?. it's your guess :P
okay. what's the guess?
yeah... I know
oh.. Kay. that's.. it?. I.. don't know. so....?
I don't know what you're guessing. I know what the wish was. sorry... I'm terrible. I'll just stop bothering you or something..
umm.. possibly?. I'm sorry
It's not
it's fine
maybe.. I don't know. like I said.. it wasn't important and it wasn't going to come true
want it to come true?. I guess I wouldn't mind it... but since "it doesn't feel right" I guess I'm just not the one. so it doesn't matter
gross?
yeah.. I guess so...
it's fine... like I said.. wasn't going to come true
it's not like it mattered. I knew it wouldn't come true. I'm sorry... I'm an awful person.. I should just go die in a hole
no one is better. I feel guilty for even thinking about it
so you're still perfect.. I'm still the awful one
I'm no where near perfect
don't be.. it's okay. It's not important
exactly.. you're what's important
my pants are happy, no worries
I'm alright I guess
I don't know. I mostly feel like an awful person
the day will come... I really don't see what's so great about me..
I didn't know that, that's nice (:
But why?
would it be fine if I said it too?
(:. It's crazy.. I love you too, Leandra (:
You're the amazing one (:
that's the craziest part... Liking me is more possible than loving my jokes
I like you too honey bunches of oats "D. :D *
haha (:
I still feel like there's someone better than me though
You're way more perfect (:. You're the bestest ever
oh, yeah.. me too :P. You're way more amazing
but you just saw me :P. Goodnight, Leandra! Sweet dreams and have an awesome amazing tastic dinner too (:. I should probably work on the dino head
if only I didn't have to leave :P
no way, never (:
oh, it definitely wasn't poison ivy. we won't see.. because you're the bestest ever
and I'll never get tired of you (:
You can touch it if you want.. :P
the plant probably gives the best hugs :P
Night, sleep well (:. You didn't hug the plant, you wouldn't know. sorry, goodnight (:. Thank you for everything. Bye for now :D
I hope so too. Bye bye (:
You're perfect (:. And you too :D
bye for now (:
hello
Sounds awesome. I hope you have fun
well.. if you don't, then don't be disappointed or anything
nah.. Frosted Flakes are great
nah, I'm not great..
nah. you are (:. anyway, have fun at steppin' out
I've got a dino head to make.. . plus me not going wouldn't change anything. bye..
I did. and that stuff was okay. I'm sorry for everything. I'm an awful person :/. sorry.. goodnight and sweet dreams
I'm not amazing :/
on another note.. wishes don't tend to come true :P but that's okay. no, I'm sorry for everything. I'm terrible
Don't be
I did :/. I'm sorry..
I'm the worst person I know.. I should stop talking to you and let you get some sleep
you should go for it. I should leave you be though
I wouldn't necessarily call it fun
It's fine. not your fault
nah, it's my fault. as always. I'm sorry for everything :/
that's surprising.. . I'm not awesome. I think.. I don't know. I dislike myself
I'm just in the way
I know.. just.. . it was okay when I wasn't there.. . but when I was there I was just sort of.. there. you had all that time with Leyla and Patrick and I probably wasn't on your mind. so you had a bunch of fun
I wasn't bored.. you just chose to be with them. which is okay I guess. I'm not that important
I don't know. I'm just not important. I was sort of there to just tag along when I was with you guys. but when I was gone it was like there wasn't a difference
You didn't look like it..
right.. I know. because it's my fault
I was alone when I was away and I was alone when I was there. that's how I felt the entire time. but that didn't matter . You'd much prefer to spend time with them. and I just run off so that you don't catch me crying
It's not your fault. It's my fault that I'm crying right now.. I just can't hold it in
It's not your fault
It's mine. but this time I've just got my own shoulder
maybe..
in all honesty though.. you preferred to be with them... that's not so convenient... seeing how far you are
I know how Patrick is.. when he's around he's all you talk to
yeah.. I know. so I left... so you could talk to him
It's not your fault. it never is
no, it's always my fault
I'll stay sad
I don't know if I'll get to sleep at all. because
why?. that's silly
it's easier in person. but I just want to die or something..
go for it
okay..
take as long as you want. I don't matter, remember?
not that it matters (like myself).. but I think I'm going to go to the duck pond on my bike instead of steppin' out.. for.. a little while at least. so.. have fun with your stuffs today... thank you so so so much (:. You're amazing and I don't know what I would do without you. as lame as that may sound. I hope you have fun at the Civil War reenactment . goodnight and sweet dreams. (this is something I didn't want to say, but.. kissing isn't important, but I sort of hope it could happen anyway, maybe just once, I don't really care.. so I wished for it, but I didn't want you to feel obligated to do so, so I felt bad about it so in turn I was an awful person.. so, I'm sorry.. and it doesn't really mean anything). anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams and have fun again (I really wish I could go :/ ) oh well.. You're awesome (:. *sigh*.. I hope you sleep really well with amazing dreams (:. Goodnight (:
It's not too important, but okay :D
scared of what? spiders?!? o.o
it's fine.. I'm terrified. I'm sure if the opportunity arose.. I would run away or something.... sorry . but it's fine (:. It's not important
I always am.. . but that's okay . Like I said.. not important. if it happens, it happens, if it doesn't, then okay. You're what's important (:
Well you have made me the happiest I've ever been
Awesome :D
but I bet the reenactment would be very interesting and simply fun because I'd be with you. but it's fine not going 
I like museums (:. and I like you. like.. the most (:. anyway, I should let you get to sleep or something. thank you for cheering me up. and I'll try to stay this way
You're smile is even better (:
and yeah, I'm cheered up (:
I hope so too
(I love your hugs too, by the way)
You're amazing, goodnight and sweet dreams (:. I'm like.. only warm with you :P. anyway, sleep well :D. thanks for everything. bye for now (:
me neither (:
You're way more amazing. Goodnight :D. Sleep really really really well. bye (:
Good morning, I hope you have a great day (:
well that makes sense. I wouldn't want to intrude. You're way more awesome. and I hope you have a lot of fun (:
nah.. . on both of those :P
yeah, I'm sorry
Have a lot of fun there (:
I've gotta find something else to do :P
And I'll try. bye (:
It's whatever :P. Bye :D
have a wonderful day. I like you too (:
Bye (:
Sorry... You're probably gone by now. so I'll just let ya sleep
I can let you continue with that 
if you sign up on Flotrack. it tells you where
Yeah... I thought you were going to that Cinderella thing :P
Yeah, several other showings. and it is a running website
Yeah
awesome. except.. not really
not that awesome... but I'm sure you had fun
that's unfortunate. but at least you got to go to that Civil War stuff (:. I was stuck home until like.. 3:45 alone
alone because I stayed home on the off chance on doing something.. and my family went out for lunch and didn't come back until then
it's whatever though. I've grown accustomed to being alone
Well.. that's crazy. I'm glad you've been chatting with him... I wasn't on facebook though.. so.. I wouldn't have known unless he called me. and when I was on.. he wasn't.. so.. yeah
yeah... so.. alone I was. for a majority of the day
crazy
I wouldn't want to bother the person I'm sitting next to though
Even though I'd like to hear your voice
haha, they like being outside and meeting new people :P. so if you come around.. they'd probably love you. which I wouldn't blame them.. because there's so much to love
I don't know as of now :P. I'll let you know when it happens :P
it would be cool if you did. Not like.. do it or anything.. but it'd be okay and understandable :P. :D
haha, awesome (:
I.. unfortunately don't know
exactly. it's out of like.. 2 maybe 3 places
yup
yup
haha, okay. sorry
oh, you've got that tomorrow?. Good luck (:. I have to make a dinosaur head in 4 days :P. I don't know if I can do it . sorry.. random
nah, I couldn't do that to you. It would be all boring n' what not
I gotta build the stuff out of cardboard first
that could be nice 
Mostly because you'd be there (:
It'd be fun. but I wouldn't want you to just be bored standing there. or something
neat (:. I gotta start as soon as possible though. and that's crazy :D
Yup. tomorrow
crazy. Why would you want to?. Aren't you busy?
that is.. early. I'm busy from 8-10 :P
yup :P
if I find out where it is. and yeah, they do
like.. it doesn't necessarily start until school starts. yeah, it's called being a "beginner"
yeah sort of
well.. conditioning kind of ended. and sort of
it's like.. stretch for 30 minutes run for an hour then finish off by stretching
and I hope you have fun too. so.. goodnight I guess?
haha, awesome. you could just.. wait to clean your room. my light in my room broke.. and I haven't replaced it yet. so it's dark and I can't clean at night >:O. random.. :P. sorry
haha, good idea. haha, maybe 
strobe party or something. crazy o.o
mine recently broke and I've never changed it
My ceiling is low :P. so I can reach it by standing 
haha. okay..
I like.. you. sorry... anyway, goodnight (:
Sweet dreams!
Have fun tomorrow :D
I'll try.. I doubt I will though :P
doubt I will have fun*. sorry. anyway, goodnight and sleep well :D. bye

I should be free today :P. just makin' that dino head

except I've just got cardboard and tape 
Okay, after my doctors appointment. I've got until thursday to finish it and I have paints
I just need the "skeleton" of the dinosaur to be made first
Yeah, I'm getting stuff for my poison ivy
and the skeleton as in.. the structure.. not the final thing. you've got poison ivy?
phew... worried me for a second
but yeah.. that's at 4:30. so.. around 5 I think I should be good :P
awesome (:. Well.. I'll let you get your stuff done, I'll start working on mine and I'll see you then :D
what kind of glue exactly?
me neither. I'll see what I can do though. I'm.. sort of excited (:. sorry... anyway, by for now :D
oh.. right. Well I can't just show up then. because she might not be :P
oh.. so.. I can just show up?. or.. no?. because like.. your house is on the way from the doctors office. or uh.. I can just go and stop bothering you....
that sounds like fun :D
see me when?
okay, gotcha. see you then. bye (:
I didn't get to say sweet dreams :P so.. Goodnight and sweet dreams :D You are.. really warm, by the way (: and amazing! sorry.. anyway, sleep really really well :D
Very late now :P. sorry.. anyway, have a great day. have fun n' stuffs "D. :D*. sorry for being late myself :/
I don't even know if it'll happen today. :P. but I should probably start working on the dino head. I'm sort of tired.. like the meds said it would do :P
you don't have to :P. You should just enjoy your day (:
that's silly :P. plus it's not important. you should like.. have a lot of fun n' stuff (:
nah :P
plus.. I'm kind of.. sleepy :P. believe it or not :P
I know :P. so crazy..
nah.. that'd be silly. plus you don't know how :P. how about some other time when I'm awake? . instead, today, you could like.. have a bunch of fun :D
aw.. you're going?. :/. okay... you too (:. I'll just, uh... find something to do.. but due to contrasting ideas.. I don't know if I can make the dino head just yet.... sorry... I'll just let you go..
that's what it sounded like
contrast by which dinosaur to make
not enough time to do both :P
yeah :P. the one that is like.. that one dino. but it's based off of what my sister thinks..
the.. Stegosaurus
the.. parasaurolophus 
you sound the cutest. sorry..
it's supposed to be.. not too scary. so.. anyway, I kinda sorta really really like you.. just to let you know. it's supposed to be.. not too scary
sorry..
(:. sorry... anyway, I'm sure you're busy with things :P
I bet that's an exaggeration, you're an amazing driver (:. so.. have fun doing that :D. And be safe!
psh.. it's just a red light :D
red is just so inviting
exactly :D. so.. have fun
and.. you're amazing (:
you're so amazing (:  and perfect (:
I slept through cross country. sorry.. . bye for now (:. I want some taco bell :P. sorry, random
I guess so. anyway, have fun (:. I'll try not to bother you with things :P
that's crazy. but I'll try not to. you're probably all busy and seeing me is no fun. so.. have fun... bye (:
(:. fun stuff :D
bye Leandra! You're way more amazing (:. I almost drank directly from a hot sauce bottle.. :P
accident :P
I had water... just imagine the difference
exactly :P. anyway, I shouldn't keep you any longer.. have fun (:
I want to keep you forever.. but I mean I should let you have fun (:
I do want taco bell >:O. bye bye (:
umm.. like.. I don't know. I don't eat there much. I had the chalupa.. or however you spell it with some green sauce once upon a time.. and that was pretty tasty :P. but I really don't know what there is to eat there
haha, I remember that :P
yup :P
anyway, don't get any ideas :P. and what for anything?. :P
bye (:. .. I think you know
I think you do
well.. I know that you're amazing. and who doesn't?. sorry.. bye for now again
(: bye. So.. goodnight n' sweet dreams (:. I hope your day was super amazing and everythign!. everything*. You're the bestest (:  sorry.. anyway, I hope you have a good night sleep and have a great day tomorrow :D you're amazing 
haha, you're good (: good morning :D Have a great day
crazy.. I was wondering if you knew it was me.. or if you thought it was some weird guy wearing a hat.. I was leaning toward the second choice :P
sorry I waved then.. and now you know :P  I should just walk down to give you a second chance (jk). I was walking from track practice. not that it matters, of course.. anyway, you looked busy, so I'll stop bothering you and let you get on with your day, which I hope that day is super amazing 
eh, it's whatever.. my day so far has been tiresome and lame.. I guess :P 
not really.. nice face though :D my day hasn't been too grand if you didn't catch that.. how has your been?
it could.. I guess.. I doubt it will, and that's awesome. sorry.. I hope you have a great rest of your day. oh, hey.. my day just got a lot worse.. not that it matters or anything, don't even know why I'm telling you... doubt you'd care :P. :/
I guess that happened . I guess I'll never know
I did.... and I don't see it if you sent it again
alright
unfortunately I haven't really gotten around to the dino head. which isn't good. and it hasn't gotten awesome.. actually just worse and worse... 
thing just haven't worked out today... and I kinda would have to get it done sooner than 8:30. and you do?
I can always find out?
so.. what is it?
oh.. okay
I bet it's cool
cool :D. so.. will I find out someday? Or never?. or.. okay..
crazy..
what's with the face?. or.. sorry. I don't know
crazy... I'm.. thinking of going on a bike ride.. or something. I wish I could find out though :P
I bet it's awesome... unlike me, ya know :P
doubt that.. I don't feel so awesome :P
I.. don't know how I feel right now.. 
How ever the way I feel.. it doesn't feel good. and awesome. enjoy the soggy cereal . I think I need to.. clear my head or something
maybe you could help.. but I wouldn't want to waste your time... or windex 
I may be.. homesick . or something... and I miss it. kinda making me sad
so.. I was thinking a bike ride would make me feel better
never seen what?
symbolic home.. :P
umm, okay
I know, that's crazzy. crazy*
doesn't matter.. . anyway.. I shouldn't bother you any longer... I should just go on that bike ride.. or whatever I choose to do
I could..
but I don't think I will..
I do know where it is..
I just can't really get to it... stop by where?
well, I'll do it.. I'll bike out to your house and get that and then go looking
I should do it before the sun goes down.. so pretty much soon
yes. so.. see you soon?
or are you just going to leave it somewhere?
why would you want to?
not really.. but okay
crazy... anyway. I'll head out now. so.. see ya
Goodnight and sweet dreams (: Thanks again.. for everything :D. Sleep super well and warm (:
no problem, I wanted to do all those things (: G'night, Leandra (:
Hello amazing (:
talking to me?
because I'm sure I'm not awesome :P. I hope you have a great day (:
sorry, mowing tomorrow :P. haha, I'm throwing a dino head together as we speak :P
hope for what?. nah, no hope.. it's not going to work out :/. I have like.. 6 hours to get this done :P
oh.. talking about that.. the lawn needs to get done tomorrow.. not today :P and I was talking about no hope for my dino. yeah.. I'm going to fail. don't suppose you'd want to help me with the dino head? yeah.. didn't think so 
Would you even want to?
crazy. well.. I did a poor job making the head.. but I thought if I had another person to help it could look better and get done faster
exactly why I asked. and it's fine. You were probably busy. not late though.. just got done building it 
you can help if you want
Just.. paper mache stuffs. I can show up to your house to make it easier on you, or you could come over here. I was planning on doing it outside :P
so.. pretty much anywhere :P
I have no preference
so pretty much anywhere is fine. unless you have a preference
If you want and food isn't necessary . unless you were.. for some reason planning on it..
haha, whatever you want to do. so.. 2:10 ish or whatever is fine with me. if that's fine with you. later if you want. show up whenever :P
take as long as you want. umm.. if you want to bring stuffs go for it. but you don't have to. I'll get started :P. I'll be chillin' in my yard :P
okay, take as long as you like. see ya 
no need to bring something though, bye for now
You're way more awesome (: and amazing and everything :3
I know how to change the ink.. it's kinda silly not to be able to :P and thanks? sorry... Hello there (:
I'm not wearing red right now. did you think you saw me?
you were on your bike?. lucky..
I've been here for a while. and by here I mean home. and not on my bike. a bike ride sounds like fun though
I don't know how it went.. I'd have to ask. I didn't have to stay that long. and the post office sounds like fun :D
haha, I wish I could help with stuff.. but I'm sure you have it all covered
is it shoes again?
just kidding
thanks for those :P. oh yeah.. I need that back, don't I
unless you want to keep it longer
well you can keep it longer if you want . I don't need it yet
my day has been slow.. I haven't done much. I'm.. kind of bored. how has yours been?
that darn ink :P. I can let you go then.. and find it . and let you get on with your day. I'm sure I'm just making things boring
that's silly
I don't. and if you're wanting to talk about schedules then know that mine is messed up and doesn't have a 5th or 6th period
no :P
am taking ad design though. I don't know.. just from what I've heard it's messed up
yeah, hopefully
haha, that'd be neat
exactly
yeah.. thanks
if you say so...
sure... I should probably let you do stuffs.. I was probably going to go on a bike ride or something. I don't know if I will. but I just don't want to waste your time
I actually have something for you.. speaking of. but I wouldn't want to drop by unannounced . but I am a waste of time :p
how'd you know?
weeding huh?
Want help with that?
Did not.. my dad is "injured" and didn't want to :P. maybe I can drop by and leave the thingy on your doorstep 
yeah, he just has a hurt knee
me too. but he's fine.. he just doesn't want to do anything :P
yeah :P. anyway, I should probably let you get to your weeding or whatever you needed to do. maybe I'll see you possibly
bye. for now. (no need to make that sound dramatic)
haha.. sorry
melon drama.. :D. haha, bye bye
for what?. weeding?. :P. sorry.. I'll just.. let you get on with stuffs an' go. sorry again..
sorry... but goodnight and sweet dreams (:
haha, thanks :D I hope you have a wonderful day (:
Crazy. It's like.. almost over though, but I'd say it's going pretty good
I hope I'm not being a bother
crazy
oh, I should ask. sorry
I was told it was good
I bet. were you thinking about going>. ?*
haha, okay. I wish I could see you today :P
But you're probably busy and you just saw me too :P
Sure I do
I get boring too
crazy. Well.. yeah (L. (: *. I like you . sorry..
haha.. okay :p. that sounds silly . I still wish I could see you. sorry..
I know.. but I'd still like to see you . maybe help you weed more :P
awesome (:
that's amazing :D
I.. don't really know
sorry... I'm no help
that sounds amazing (:
that sounds delicious . haha, you're making me hungry :P
that would be silly. because of your various birthday things?
either one sounds delicious (:
haha. you've got a lot on your plate it sounds
plate means plans. or your day
!!. Let's do it :D
yeah, that's very spicy :P
should be
haha. you don't have to go there :P
I don't think I could. I'm bad with spicy food.. you'd be the one to beat me :P
yeah, really
that sounds very nice of you
sure you are (:. You're like.. the nicest person I know :D
not crazy... well.. I guess I'll get to talk to you some other time then
I never got to see you today.. but I guess it's okay :P. sorry...
inconvenient and/or boring for you?
why would it be like that for me?
I guess it is. I guess there's some other time though...
I wouldn't know when though :/
you don't have to. they're probably tired of me by now anyway
I mean.. you know.. you hanging out with me.. n' stuff. your mom is probably tired of that.. maybe. I don't know...
yeah, I guess not
haha, okay :P. sorry
aww.... okay. I hope your birthday tomorrow is great
sorry... just saying it now in case I don't get the chance
(:>*. that'll be you tomorrow. because it's like.. wearing a hat
It's probably lame of me to have wanted to say "Happy Birthday" first... But I don't think I'd get that chance. sorry, I should let you get to your stuffs
you would be..
and it wouldn't be the say
for me at least. I don't do anything on my birthday
same*
haha, awesome. Hmm.. when could I give you your gift?. like.. when would be good for you?
but that's your actual birthday
wouldn't you be busy then?
you say that now..
nah, I wouldn't want to ruin your birthday. and I have the feeling like your entire day would probably be filled up. so.. no time for me
you don't have to
I could just drop off the gift.. 
well.. I might not be able to do that. but I could still leave you something
I mean.. I'm just saying.. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.. . so if you do catch me leaving your gift, then you'd see me :P
okay.. I'll show up then. :P
Before 2pm :P. if I'm not supposed to show up then.. :P. you.. wouldn't even know o.o
what do you mean exactly?
oh. sorry. well... I don't know. why would you want to see me at all?
but.. it's your birthday :P. Hmm.. how do you feel about scavenger hunts?
well.. would you have the time to do a scavenger hunt tomorrow at all?
there will be. tomorrow
yeah, hopefully it'll be fun
it would sound lame if I told you. just, don't ask and wait for tomorrow
don't worry about it. as long as I get to see you tomorrow, we can go on a scavenger hunt
oh, okay. have fun then (:. I hope I get to see you tomorrow.. just let me know if you can do that scavenger hunt or not
awesome.. just let me know a good time and a bad time then. thanks for doing the same for me (:
so.. after 2pm.. just let me know if anything comes up. have fun n' stuff and a good night too if I don't say it (:. Bye
haha, thanks. bye
awesome (: see ya hopefully. Happy Birthday. I bet you get that a lot though
ish? . aww... :/
Darn :/
not really..
Well I don't. sorry... I shouldn't bother you on your birthday. so I'll leave at goodnight. sweet dreams
well since you told me.. it won't happen
I haven't done anything for you to be thankful for. and sure.. 
that's silly. I don't even do much. *sigh*... sorry... goodnight
that's also silly... goodnight
I love you too.. Have an amazing birthday (:
I'll try.. in like.. a month or so :P. Sweet dreams (:. I'm glad I stayed up to talk to you
You should be excited, it's your birthday (:
you shouldn't be, that stuff is silly
okay, goodnight. sleep well (:. I wish you could stay just a lil' longer
You don't have to. It's probably not worth the wait.. but I'm almost done
you will see soon enough. it's sort of.. poorly done though
nah.. it's really bad.. and silly. I posted it on your wall
I hope it's not too disappointed. disappointing* 
sorry.. it's lame. but it's what I did to pass the time until it was exactly 12am
nah.. couldn't be
You're cute (:. sorry..
that was all it was... so.. I shouldn't keep you any longer. goodnight and sweet dreams
I hope I get to see you later. bye (:
whoa.. that would be fun (:
I've only done it once
I've never done it with premade stuff :P. I had to do it by hand 
nah. not really. hmm.. do you like cupcakes?
but chocolate or vanilla would be fine, right?
aw.. you wouldn't want me to make you anything?
you could have both 
I mean.. I'd have to give you the cupcakes somehow..
I don't.. actually
I'm not that great when it comes to cupcakes though.. so.. I don. 't know*. I thought a cupcake would be better than a full out cake though
hmm.. maybe I should make you a cake.. :P
you're going to love what I don't do the most :P. because that stuff is clearly better. anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams (:
you too (:
Haha, that's not even half of it :p
haha.. we'll see. g'night, Leandra (:
haha, I'm afraid if you get too excited you'll just get disappointed . bye for now *:. (: *
I really really like you too . Bye (:
Me too :P  Well.. actually.. this just gives me more time for stuffs :D. (:
time for what?
haha.. okay
oh, for stuffs. you said you had to brb? I'll let you get to that. I hope I can get the opportunity to see you later.. but I still need that time :P
I don't know.. but I will let you know when I'm ready to take you on that scavenger hunt. so.. yeah, the time will vary :P. sorry for any inconvenience . But yeah, hopefully see you later (:. bye for now.. maybe brb, who knows. sorry
okay, almost done, just hold on tight :P
oh.. okay, I'm done by the way. just let me know when is a best time for you :P
you should be at your house. and I'll just come get you
yourself 
it doesn't matter
and no we aren't
All you need is yourself :P
So.. I'll see you around 4:20. if that's okay
awesome, bye (:
Was she?. Because I can always go back :P
I mean.. unless you don't want me there of course
Hey, I will be there for you if you want. It's your birthday, after all. sorry.... but seriously, it's not out of the way
Sounds like a blast (:. so.. as soon as possible?
Or are you tired of me?
does that mean "as soon as possible"?
That's fine.. it'll take me like.. that long to get there anyway. if that's alright. sorry.. I wouldn't want to spoil your birthday
neat. I don't want to be a burden though
I would be.. my parents were kind of surprised that I came back :P. as silly as that sounds
Yeah, crazy, right?. so.. if you don't mind.. I think I'd like to see you again soon (:
You were close! (:. anyway, I'll give you that 15 minutes
and I'll ride along, if that's okay
Bye (:
sorry, was that slow enough?. sorry again :P goodnight and sweet dreams (: . Good morning on the day after your birthday (:
nah, I'm not cool. and that's awesome. sorry for stuffs. I missed ya :/. sorry, I hope you have a great day
Crazy
awesome
awesome (:. Looking forward to it
:p
sorry. for stuffs. I should probably let you get to stuffs and stop bothering you
exactly.. I should let you do that stuffs. I'm just a waste of time :P
sure I am :P. I still have the receipt.. so you can return me whenever you want
:P. you might want it.. I'm a pretty lame gift. it's sort of silly to consider myself one too. plus it's like.. giving you me more than once
I was.. thinking of that this morning. that specific slogan... sorry..
I know :P. Whoa.. your birthday was pretty amazing?. That's awesome (:
that's silly
way better than mine :D
no way, it was way better.. mostly because I was able to make it with you (:
nah, I'm not awesome. brb
I'm what?
it's fine.. I'm sorry for everything else. anyway, you're probably busy. I was going to ask you something, but I think I figured it out
I don't have a ride from orientation.. but I think I can just ride my bike back home
It's fine, my dad can bring my bike there. I wouldn't want to be a bother and by biking I wouldn't be
sounds fun, but what do you mean by "go straight home"?
ohhh
I was just wondering because like.. I don't know.. I wouldn't want to be in the way or anything. I mean, I'd like to.. but aren't you tired of me?
If you say so :P. I'd think it'd be fun. I don't know how you'd feel about it
I mean spending time with you (:. the most fun (:
Oh, I was about to be all like "I'm glad you guys liked them :D". but.. now I realize.. that you've barely had them :P. I kinda liked the one I ate. :P. I passed out on the couch last night
I can always make more :P. and I'm glad you took them out (: . and thanks for letting me help n' what not :P
haha, I don't know.. It gave me a reason to stay a bit longer (:. So.. that was nice (:. and, I don't know.. stuff that normally isn't too fun.. just becomes more fun just because you're there (:. sorry..
me too. I'm scared that there's a chance that it might not though
well.. it's a bit more complicated than that. but we'll see
sort of.. I could always ditch photo and take 2 classes instead. I don't know though. I mostly just want my first period class in the 8th grade hallway
I hope that you are (:. It's mostly my english class that's really in the way
exactly. yeah, I know. but I can either drop that class or photo. :P
the english I'm taking, yes :P
are you taking psych?
I was thinking of taking it anyway. but photo got in the way
which period is it?. oh, and you'd be surprised to how relative psych is :P. I was thinking of just signing up for it through an online course
hmm.. that would also interfere with the whole english thing..
so it looks like english is a very evil thing :P
online courses could be fun :P
Gap's been doing something, of which I'm still unclear about. and he says it isn't so bad. so probably just the math ones
yes :P. sorry... I can go if you're busy
oh, okay. have fun with that, and thanks. you still don't have to though
no problem. see you later I suppose
Bye. Have fun at the post office. It's pretty nifty there the last I recall
I know. I wish I had a letter to send so I could go there :P. because it's fun there :D
oh, even more fun :D. buh bye
Have fun. You're amazing. .. sorry. I'm so sorry for everything :/. I hope you have a goodnight though and sweet dreams. :/. I hope you have a great day tomorrow, if you need help with any last minute summer things.. sorry
I couldn't go to practice today because it was inconvenient on my parents :P. I hope you have a great day. I'm so sorry for everything.. I feel like an awful person... I should just disappear or something, that way I couldn't bother you any more... soo sorry :/ I'll uh.. get on my bike today and just be gone the whole day, that way I won't be able to ruin your last day of summer
sorry
so sorry :/. I made sure my bike was outside, and it is. so.. I should go ahead and stop wasting your time. have a great last day of summer
no, it's out of the car. and I don't think I would be very fun to talk to. I'm pretty lame
I'd say I am. I think I'll go on that bike ride I said I would. sorry for talking to you
but I said I wouldn't.. because I didn't want to bother you on the last day of summer. so.. have fun today. sorry
I won't
I'm not feeling so great.. . I'm feeling pretty down. sorry..
but yeah.. I was just going on that bike ride so I wouldn't get in the way of anyone..
*sigh*.. I wouldn't want to waste your time
sure I am... I don't do anything right or anything. I'm nothing special
I'm guessing not..
okay...
:/
I don't know.. but it doesn't matter either way. I should just let you get on with your day. and I'll go on that bike ride.. or do something else
I wouldn't want to be a bother
not really. I'm just me
nope
I wouldn't say so
crazy... anyway.. I should let you get to the post office before it closes
if you wanted.. but I was going to bike to the duck pond. I guess I don't have to though
I was just biking there so I wouldn't be in the way of anything... if you really wanted I could meet you at the post office
that's a bit out of the way, wouldn't you say/. ?8. ?**
that's silly
I wouldn't want you to go through all of that effort just to see me..
I could just see you at the post office though
it's closer than the duck pond. but if you don't want me there I don't have to go
sure, sounds good. see you then
bye
you are cool sounding (:. I really hope you make it home safely.. I kind of regret not biking you home, but I trust you (: I just got in from catching my cat, which was crazy.. and that stray cat hung around for a lil' while :P sorry.. stuffs you don't need to know... anyway, goodnight and sweet dreams :D Have fun with the stuffs that I took you away from doing and I hope to see you tomorrow (: G'night Leandra, I really really like you (:
you too (:. I'm really glad your safe
I'm glad for that too (:. Sorry.. that was probably silly of me to do that 
haha (:. I should let ya get some sleep, a lot ahead of us tomorrow . Thank you for everything (:
sorry :P. (:. Anyway, goodnight. I really like you (:. sorry... Sweet dreams :D
I can't wait (. (: . Bye Leandra. And why are you thanking me?. You made today awesome (:
You too :D
Bye, you're amazing
Sleep well. see you hopefully
Dream of amazing things (:. bye :D
As long as you're in them. sorry... silly thing to say. G'night
always so busy. :P
I hope not. <3. sorry..
:P
sorry
I like yours (:
Bye, Leandra
I did
Goodnight n' sweet dreams
As long as you're there 
sorry for keeping you for so long. and I hope you do
If you want to bring my shirt, you don't have to. I could always use my shirt as an excuse to see you again tomorrow after school. or.. well, that's a bit silly.. . but it's up to you. anyway, see you tomorrow (:
Whoa, really?
!!
!!!
!!!!
sorry... Are you going to go see it?
If I didn't have practice :/
no one gives out homework on the first day
ah.. good point. but that wasn't really.. homework was it?
Oh.. so.. it wasn't an inclass essay as I thought. my bad
nah, you should be fine the first week. or something like that at least
you too. Have a great night and great sweet dreams. and great everything (:
You're just great :D. Bye
You're way more amazing. Bye. :D
I know.. sorry... like I said just a bit ago... awful the entire way home. sorry sorry sorry soo sorry :/. I honestly didn't mean it.. but I shouldn't bother you either way.. I'm an awful person. :/
no.. it's fine. I'm sorry
Oh, just sort of.. filled a cupcake cup with the cupcake batter. and then I dropped in the filling. and you shouldn't be sorry. I'm terrible
Well I do.. either way. You're amazing and you don't even try
less weird than craigslist though. but no, I don't think you try. you're so so amazing (:
And I didn't mean what I said.. . like.. I don't care about that sort of stuffs
and it's not even what I wished for or important
I wouldn't want to make you feel obligated to do anything anyway
I'm not. Legend Quest Finale is on tonight :P. sorry.. random
but.. anyway.. like... I don't know. I'm sorry
I don't know
I'm sorry :/
I know it's not something you like... I'm sorry. and what I wished for won't come true
uh oh
but yeah, depends on what I wished for.. 
that's good
That's sad. I'm sorry. I just wish.. . sorry, never mind
Like.. I don't know, I would like to hold your hand or something.... it doesn't matter though. because, for the most part.. I just feel like you want me away and that you could talk to someone else.. 
it might be... it doesn't matter
Talking to me isn't so fun
well like.. I want to be around you.. but when I am it feels like you don't want to be around me. and that feeling just carries on for a while. so even when you do want me around.. the feeling that you wouldn't still hangs over me
Feel like what?. Do I do that to you too?
Noooo. I just never want to bother you. because you find so many people to talk to. and I just want to fade away so I don't consume your time
But I want to spend like.. every second with you
Like.. I mostly get sad because I do that
Like, if I didn't do that.. I wouldn't be sad
No it's like.. I don't know. I don't want to be mean or bothersome or annoying. so I fade away. but I do want to.. you know?
And I'm sad because I listen to my head instead of my heart
because if I listened to my heart I'd hear you
and you'd be like.. there's nothing to worry about
haha
sorry
But you're like.. all of my heart, and it misses you when I'm not around you. but my head is just mean and makes me think stupid stuffs. sorry.. this probably sounds silly
It's like.. the thought that I'm away from you.. and that I could change that makes me sad. But I just don't want to be bothersome. I feel like other people could make you happy and be more amazing
That's kind of why I wished that I could hold your hand. because then I couldn't leaveI guess so :PHi Leandra!! Hope you had a wonderful fall break. I know you're not my group's grader for CS4501, but if you have any time tomorrow, would it be possible to do a code review? I'm free anytime besides 11:00AM - 12:15PM. Thanks!!So I believe each video/reading is worth .25 and every book is .5. So if you're just doing videos, it should be about 40. Well I'm looking at it now and there's some interesting math...but in the spreadsheet you have 7 extra credit and that adds 2.33 to your total if that tells you anything. that includes reading + other extra credit problemsPusheen!. ice skating sounds fun btw. you bring the skate, i'll bring the ice
naw, it's to cool you down. when you're on fire busting some crazy ice skate move. .-.
HAHA on command. *someone call an ambulance, Leandra just simultaneously combused. !! *
we shall mourn her fire moves. tbh that'd be so cool but prolly the stupidest way to die lol
oh yeahhh
Yeah yeah, i'll resuscitate you. knowing me, prolly will melt in my pocket
???? who told u
lol snd that to peter when he says, "grl ur legs smoove like butter". gonna make some ribs rn. i'll be in mclean tomorrow
Booz Allen is having an ice cream social in that office and I have some meetings there too.. Don't you work nearby in VA?. ^^ if you bust a dance move and catch fire, with chocolate and butter in your pocket, you'll make freaking brownies right there on the spot. It'll be the coolest brownies ever
https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Booz+Allen+Hamilton+Inc,+Greensboro+Drive,+McLean,+VA/Capital+One+Bank,+1680+Capital+One+Tower+Dr,+McLean,+VA+22102/@38.9217164,-77.2279874,15.5z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b64af1850a7293:0x56783a5a4392d86d!2m2!1d-77.2323739!2d38.9223396!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b64ab359d4f047:0xb1c8082dfdde581d!2m2!1d-77.21318!2d38.924185. we're so clos. At my work, we have the option of working in any office so I could be at Mclean whenever
So I have two plans. Booz Allen is going to an Oriole's game but I don't have a car. There's also a food truck thing going on in DC and then some jazz thing that I could also go to.. I haven't thought much about it but we should definitely meet up for lunch or something
I'm not sure .... and the coordinator hasn't specified if it's free .......
bc there's one that costs money on the weekends and then there's this thing that they're inviting us to. What's Lunch and learn?
lol sounds like quite the experience. they're gonna kill me when they find out i don't intern there tho lol. catered should be good, hope u enjoy
lol I'll be like that Spongegar meme when they ask, "so what are you working on". I didn't know you were so close; some of my team members work out of McLean so whenever I'm in the area for group work, you know I gotchu homie
nice nice :). so what's the plan for this weekend. we'll hang on Saturday and do stuff. and maybe potentially meet up very briefly tomorrow
What's your day look like tomorrow?
LOL. obscured in a shroud of mystery. during the work day ~ :p
so it looks like 11:45 - 12pm you are free
LOL. I would totally invite you but it's an ice cream social for our small FSO so only like 12 people would be there lol. it's too tightly knit a group
hahah. you can be the person that delivers in the ice cream
LOL
because all ice cream deliveries wear cool hats lol. lemme check my schedule
it's like those street vendors in the city. so i've got meetings 10 - 10:30 , 1 - 2, and 2- 4. my whole team is going to be there so i won't be able to sneak out but I can claim "lunch break" at around 11am. you know any dope places to grab lunch around?
I think we should def do Saturday. but if possible, could briefly meet up tomorrow, show me the cool places to hit up in McLean. Friday I'm still deciding between the baseball game or jazz festival. It's tough choice
GAS
breh
lol "oh how the turntables"

hahahah like the second time , he thought u were like "oh... whole foods, huh?". and then he reconsidered his purchase and contemplated his life
Lol i told him, youre the nicest person ever
*when not holding an orange. He was all like, hey eric...what's wrong with whole foods heh?!. Lmaoo so every time we pass by whole foods we wiggle eyebrows at him and shit lol
Patrick lol. I mean. His name is. Whole foods guy
Shhh
i was thinking trader joes. Better, we can go to costcos and go around eating free samples and changing outfits repeatedly so we can get multiple samples
Oh yeh, you know it. if we're lucky, we can even get some free perfume samples. and smell overwhelmingly terrible
lolll. please. here we can compromise. i'll play guitar while you wear a mustache walking thru costco getting free samples. what is your third favorite song?
costco mariachi band!
Regina!!. i forgot we both listen to her. you got it
You diiiid
You showed me "katie queen of Tennessee" too I think
Hey it's ok, i completely forgot what it sounds like. only bc i rlly enjoy that song. nba game on rn ITS CLOSE

goodnight bud
Loooolll hardcore bandwagon
its just so sad. steph curry (with the shot boy) set a league record in wins, goes up 3-1 in the finals, and then loses. Its like the cinderella story but steph curry doesnt find true love and dies
Lol yeah. The thing is, gsw was up 3-1. You need 4 wins to win a championship. Then Lebron and the cavs won 3 in a row and then got the championship. Everyone expected gsw to win bc they had the best record ever in history and were 1 game away from a championship but then they lost 3 in a row and choked. he was the chosen one
yeah. How was your day?
hey Leandra good to hear from you,  My day went pretty well. Put together a presentation for tomorrow's meeting with our client but caffeine crashed halfway through it so tomorrow should be fun. Tomorrow will be presentation time so will be fun, gotta get ready. Good luck on the intensive project, I'll pray to Abraham Lincoln to guide you to the bugs tomorrow. Hope you have a good day tomorrow too,  Ding
hey
How are u ?
hold on, brb, playing league. do u have skype?
im dingdong101012. brb. hey. we lost. presentation went well. It was somewhat informal and less hype than I had anticipated but we got the job done and some data files as well.
mhm. just businessy things. wbu. how've the tidings been
i'm sure your guitar enjoys you spending time with it as well. day 4 thooo. that's hype, I bet next time we hang you'll be jacked and *so* in shape
yeah im like jamming out right now. LOL oh ****. don't get too strong. too strong then i'll never trust you with another orange ever again. last time you controlled yourself but given the power, who knows what'll happen next ...
I'm playing. a sexy F#m. *twang*
nope. I have not the proficiency to style my own chords. Teach me *your ways*. yo if u been practicing singing as i've been hearing from the streets, we could form a *band*

Lol read the urban one. I looked thru the photos again. Lol. And guess what i found
LOL. MY HOVER HAND. Its the cheesiest thing ive ever seen
Do u want to see it ?
It's really corny
Yes! That's what it was lol. All the other ones r not hover hand. Just thought thiz one was rlly funny. *disassemble* jesus Leandra lol
Do u want the rest?. So the craziest thing. I won ANOTHER ticket to the nats game today from booz allen
Apparently its mets and nats again O.o
Im rlly not sure , not at all lol. I wish i could invite u but they raffled these babies out. All the interns are like DOES ANYONE HAVE A TICKET I CAN HAVE ?!
Yo wya. R u at the air and space museum???. I just met Joshua!!. Whats that one thing called that you use to make apps usable on multiple developing platforms?
I was thinking docker
haha yeah, so Josh was pretty cool. He said u two were working on the same project

Yeah, a couple interns and students under the same scholarship program met up there and walked around. How is ny?
Are u still there?
Oh cool. Me too. Im with my family. Where r u ?
Nice. Have fun. I heard u met my friends randomly! Lol
Yeahh haha. small world lol. LOL just got a haircut and im decisively neutral about it. Howis the hackathon?
Lol ill send u some later. Did u make u drone ?
IT DROPS CASH ahaha. That's so cool. Did u built this from scratch?. Intern life is ok, average. Life seems to come most from life itself and coming of age and not working. If work was life id be in some trouble :[. Im at trivia night now
Goodnight?
HAHA ok goodnight. hey. are you in mclean atn
argg I was just there. Firm had a terrorism "hackathon" and I dropped by for ten minutes
We won!!!. my team had a super trivia guy. we won by one point and each got these really nice boze speakers. I was in McLean
The hacks? Its a public firm thing. We have some folk randomly coming in. How are you?
Yeah it was an intern event.  Have fun mon ami
hello?
hey pal. I'll be in McLean tomorrow
I can get off around 4ish, 5. They have a hiring event todau from 1 to 5 but its not rlly represent to me
!! Holy lol you're loaded with fun things to do lol. But i can't hang for long, i have dinner with the room mates.. What are those things?
Id say around 7 to 8ish. Yeah yeah, something casual and light. Bowling in canada and trapeze school tho ....
Lets just get some ice cream and chat :). Hey!. My Wi-Fi was out. Im in the ritz carlton!
Imma be busy for like 20 mins
Theres a valet roundabout jawn. Can u come in 10 mins?
Lemme know when u leave
Omw
You wanna do escape the room this weekend ?
Aiyaaa. Ok haha. Have fun :)
Oh man it was great. I learned so many things ! How was your weekend?
Hey. I'm in McLean all this week and next week ! I'm moving out my dorm this Friday , sent u an invite to the going away party :0
Next Friday
I'm in a predicament trying to find a couch to crash on. Im checking with some friends and interns in the area if they can sneak me in. That sucks, but yeah, definitely meet up before next weekend ! Are u going to that hackathon this weekend?
Music festival ?. Hey speaking of renting, I've been asking some friends about housing. I was wondering, if u weren't up for it, if u had some friends renting housing or such that had more space in their house for me to crash, paying rent of course.. Like some them c1 interns that have an aptmt with some space on the floor to sleep
nice , ty ty. So I'm out by next Friday so if we wanna hang, that's the date
I have !! In McLean
Wow, thanks for reaching out! I appreciate that a lot. Yeah I found a place with some of my buddies for cheap and will live there for four days next week
hey !. so today was the last day of the internship. Im at a restaurant with some interns and then going home at 6
Bushels and barrels
I'm on my way out. Yeah it was ok
and you ??
Ahhh. I see lol
aww. i don't think we'll have the time today. but we will meet again at a hackathon
of course. Mhacks, bitcamp both being fantastic choices. Hey Leandra !. The thought occurred to me recently that it was inconsiderate for me to have left without hitting you up this summer. I spent the last week sleeping on a deflated air mattress in a basement and was rushed everywhere as the internship was wrapping up. It was my fault I didn't communicate with u that i was leaving, which I should have had the respect to let u know since we are good friends. I apologize for not reaching out and seeing u again but I do hope we can get together sometime at some hackathon
Ayyy. how goes it ?
good, im glad to hear! Schools tough but im doing more career things. How's school ?
Both ! Doing all the things I always thought I couldn't do now aha. I wanna hear about these projects and song!! Are u finally starting your YouTube cover channel you've been telling me about ? :O
lol what. these quadrants
That sounds super cool !
Ahh did u not like capital one ?. With CV, would it store everyone's faces as the checklist ?. That's the real compsci that's interesting. How well does the programming translate from basic data structures and logic to real world stuff like that? And it's cool bc u do fun stuff for class :0. Im doing basic stuff like websites and app dev. There's a whole lot of stuff outside comp sci in soft dev I don't know about aha. I went to a hackathon last weekend and placed second , which was really fun. I want to go to a lot more this year now that I know how to code. I'll let u know which ones I sign up for, it'll be cool to hack together again. + super hype for this song
Oop! Haha I can explain. I mean to get back to u later, I see ur messages :p. heyo sorry for the delay. I believe NN stands for neural network, which sounds really cool; I'll do some research for that. I'm just getting into self projects; i had never done any before so just doing something I've never done is still new to me aha; It's so rewarding tho and not too far off from class projects so I was kinda wondering why I hadn't done it earlier. The project we made essentially was a crummy webapp for a charity. We won because of our idea and face-value implementation but none of the stuff actually works or looks like how it should. I liked Donald Trump to get to know him; everyone hates him so much I wanted to see how he utilizes rhetoric to manipulate people into actually liking him. He's an interesting case study for sure. Ayy u sign up for technica , umds all women hackathon ??
Ahhhh. Dang, ok !. Would've been cool, u could meet my gf and everything. Hope u have fun tho with momma Irvine and that exams have been kind to u
Is registration still open ??. I've been meaning to go to a hackathon at an ivy league school. It's good for me but lots of work
hey ! how's it going Leandra?
Belize !!! I didn't know that haha, I'm taking a winter course at UMD to knock out some credits.. Someday I hope to get out there and study abroad somewhere. how'd your fall semester go?. Hey!
Hahah hey it's alright. Communications. How's it been??
oh shoot haha public speaking
Yeah, I find myself spontaneously public speaking to myself in my room very frequently. I'm doing well too. Classes are getting interesting and relevant too. What've u been up to lately? always something new!
hahah he just gave us topics and tips, like making eye contact, signposting, moving the room, and all that, it's really all about practice. Chinese !!!
HAHA. proficient enough to say you're not proficient. :P. apply to mhacks!
yehhhh. reuuuunion. that'd be so cool. definitely gotta meet up again before u graduate and become an adult haha
yeh!. just sometype of reunion. I didn't realize that the summer might be the last time we could meet up. you r a good friend of mine, I would like to stay in touch
SF !!!. hahaha. whatchu up to in SF? haha. ( i dream to move out there as well)
ooo that's really cool
Ayy lmao imma be at JP Morgan in Delaware :D
Yah! Haha money money. Nah but I've been at booz and now JP. Neither r really tech companies...
Yeah that's also true. I'm excited tho!. Are you looking forward to adult life?
sounds like u just read me your cover letter Leandra :pHey hey , taking algorithms , programming languages , digital circuits , quest and EIP. Programming languages is pretty cool but I'm working on project now. Fun fun funHey we're in the room to the left of where we checked in if you need a place to work. Otherwise happy hacking :)
^_^. Hey Leandra are you going to VTHacks this weekend?
Also wanna form a team? xD I haven't really started thinking of making a team because I joined late notice
Oh LOL okay!. Also can I give your name and number to the VT bus person?
/what is it again. Oh jk found it in contacts
LOL 8-)
I don't think too early.. Probably like slightly early
And I guess help the guy leave UVA lol but not much else. Yes
Thank you! :D
They haven't sent me anything. I think you just need to tell me how many you counted going so that I can count how many come back. And those have to match on my part. I'll let you know when/if they email a roster. I think they will. If not I guess make a pseudo roster of people who went
Woo
Here's the information for the buses. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1niau4sbyF-IxnAB_l0o3Jdp_d59dchMQmjClfLka3EU/edit?usp=sharing. Thanks again! :D
That's fine! I think my train got delayed. Let me know which API's you wanna work with and whatnot. I'll just do like a small iOS app. To go along with your chrome extension. Also do you know who else may have wanted to join our team?
Oh I just wanna do iOS lol nothing big or fancy. Oh alright :D. Uh the ETA is 11:30pm. How's food and sponsors so far? :o
Yeah bus delays @_@. Oh alright good luck!
I'm getting off at the VTech bus stop, whatever that means. Is that close to the engineering building?. O_o
Oh alright thanks :)
Which room are you in :o
Ok thanks. Did you form a team :o. Cause I don't know who I'm looking for xD
Oh I found Niti :D but she has team LOL so I didn't wanna bother her. I'll go find Christine
XD
Alright :D. Thank you!!
Congrats
it's wonderful, but you do miss Virginia from time to time :p. where are ya working :po. :o
Hehe yeah I was considering moving back in 5 years. Maybe slightly longer. Oh cool! We should meet up once you're here! :D. I can help with settling in. It sucked ass doing it alone
Do you need help finding housing. Did cap one help u
Yeah. I live near Hayward
I stayed in airbnb. While asking company people. Ideally you have housing prior to arriving. But that's hard. Padmapper. Housinganywhere. Join the local group on fb (which you did)
And ask locals. Ooo. Are you not bringing your belongings
I think it's fine tbh. California won't mind xD
WOAH YOU BOARD!?!?. Let's board when you get here. When do you plan to fly here :o
Oh lol I suck though xD the people who do real skating in SF are nuts. They weave thru traffic downhill at like 20mph. I can barely go down JPA without falling
Oh lool. Yeah I was considering getting rollerblades too
LOL its far less common, thats for sure. i grew up rollerblading. so I wanted to get back into it. and I like ice skating too
but it's harder to find place to ice skate around here :p. I took the skating arena for granted at UVA. xD. use it while you can!!. (i'm sure there are some here but i haven't found yet)yea pretty much. sometimes can get chilly to like 60. l o l. 'chilly'here's the survey invite i was telling you about! http://www.surveysavvy.com/?m=3524831. Here's a link to that list of things for college: http://sdrv.ms/10kT5TG you can edit it and print and whatever
Thank you!!. I ended up going and getting two bras and a Victoria's Secret credit card...oops hahah by the way, is there anything in particular that you want for graduation or college? Send me a list of a few things you might want! Don't worry about the price of anything!
Haha sorry, I was looking at the new emojis and didn't know they automatically sent. I thought that one was the strangest
So you can't use them on the computer? But you can see them? Weird haha. I just discovered them today
The basketball player? What did he come to talk about? Something inspirational?
I googled the name...haha I didn't know who he was, to be honest. And wow that's really cool, I'm glad everyone was so respectful. We had a few really good speakers my freshman and sophomore year too, but I can't remember them now..oops do you have any ideas of what to get mom for Mother's Day?
haha okay!
Those look right! It says 2013-2014 but the questions and comments say it should fit the 2014 too. *2015. Thank you so much!!!!! That's such a nice present!!
I can pick you up at the airport, I just need your flight information! Could you send me your flight info?. Hope you're having fun!!!. Also, do you happen to have dads tax information for this year? Or know how much he made last year?
It's username adriana329 or Adri329@gmail.com and pw should be five52 or leandra814 haha. and thank you!!
Thanks! It went well and I can see perfectly now!!
Ohh I didn't see that you replied haha the recovery was okay! The first few hours were rough, but otherwise it's been fine! Just had to be super careful the first week not to touch my eye or get water in it. But I'm all good now!. How was your first week of class?
Can't believe you're going to get your Masters in just five years! You're too smart and motivated. Mom said you're looking at Belize or Australia? Have you decided? And yes! The earlier you apply, the better! The career fair is your best opportunity to get a job. But at least you already have one! I'm okay, work and the med school applications are all I really have time for, I'll be relieved when I'm done writing essays. And no problem!! Glad that you're still going to the Questbridge events!
Hey hey -- do you wanna share this gift for Shaelynn?. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IUAAK2A/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I was just going to have it delivered by Tuesday and then wrap and ship it myself!
you don't have to pay extra! i'll let you know how much the total ends up being though!!
:). How did your finals go??. Did you take the linear final?
Oh yay for getting all As! Good job! Awh, that's okay, she's a really great teacher!
Haha nope!. Im probably never going to play PlayStation again
Hey! I hope your trip to Belize went well!! I can't wait to hear about it and see more pictures. I know you have a crazy schedule this semester, but will you be free anytime next Wednesday after 4pm?
Yup! I booked an airbnb for Tuesday night, I'll be staying in the Villas at Southern Ridge. Okay, does dinner at 6:30PM work for you?
Yeah - do you know her???
oh haha that's funny!!
how is it?. Poke sounds really good!!
Oooooh i'll be sure to bring workout clothes then
Thank you!! I know you're busy too with your 18 (19?) credits!!. hope everything's going well!
hahaha
Okay! I'm at Shenandoah joes
Yeah! I'm starving! I'll walk over to poke bowl now!
Hmm I don't need a mini fridge, which other things are you selling? And already??
Ohhh true. Good idea!!!
Hmmmm wellll I'm interested in the bookcases, nightstand, desk, other bookcase and table
And the heater and air purifier
Haha I just have a full! But I definitely want at least a full sized bed
Oh no! Don't keep them around for that long just in case!. If you send pictures I can decide from those
Not by uva!!!
How are your classes going?
Whoa! So cool! It's cute! What are you going to program it to do?
Can it break dance? Haha. Hmmmmm
Yeah.. I don't have any good ideas right now, but I'll let you know if I come up with anything haha I'm excited to see what program you end up with!
They used drones during the halftime show!. Are you watching the Super Bowl?
Haha just for the lights!
Ohh okay! I'm sure you're super busy with homework
Falcons!. Oh yay, good luck writing!!!. When is your thesis due?
Nope! I tried betterment once - it just invests the money for you. I've heard good things about the Robinhood app though! I just don't want to reduce the amount of financial aid that I can receive or complicate my taxes haha. How long have you been using it for?. Maybe I can give you money to invest for me haha
Oh my goodness!! You have stock in tesla? Wow! Did you sell?. And it depends on how many tax forms you have. It'll probably only take you a half hour with turbotax. Cause you just have the W2 from uva, right?. Ooohh and capital one. But it really shouldn't take too long. I can help answer questions if you have any!
She claimed me as a dependent when I was a fourth year also, since the tax break is better for her?
And oh, she needs help filing her taxes???
Oh okay, turbotax walks through it step by step
Hmmm I don't think so? Does it look like this one: http://uvabookstores.com/labcoatform.aspThanks for asking! I may need one later, but I don't know right now. so you should go ahead and sell!
