!! My mom said that she saw you in a restaurant! That can only mean that she was just hallucinating or... that you're back in Blacksburg! :D  I hope you had a super-duper-amazing-wonderful-awesometastic time over at La Escula Castellano de Gov. (Yes, I haven't been practicing. :P) and I hope you had some memorable experiences and that you learned a lot! :D You might even be fluent now, for all I know!
:D oh yeah, She did in fact, say hi to me for you. Your skillz will definitely come in handy for Senors class! :P I've been spending a lot of time in a cadaver lab this past week.. :{P (Smiley with awkward mustache.)
:D It's cool that they had you completely immersed! That must have been really fun!! :D I'm sure Senor wouldn't mind..but yeah, I suppose during the first week when most people (such as myself) have forgotten a lot, it might send them into shock if they hear too much all at once. :P  Ah yeah, cadavers do take some getting used to, if that's possible. O.o They weren't sketchily acquired or anything though, not that that makes it any better. And they were used for learning purposes only. :P Oh, I learned the fundamentals of Polka! 
Crazy! lol I remember my surprise when Senor Opazo told us he thought in Spanish. :P It sounds really difficult if it's not your first language though--I still read spanish by translating it into English first. I think I'd have a really tough time getting to know someone in spanish! I wouldn't know exactly what to say without a trusty spanish-english dictionary. And a 2nd grade vocabulary can only get you so far... :P  Whoa. The dream could be a sign, but I'd say you're at least more fluent than most students. :D I've always wondered what our "American-speaking-spanish" accent sounds like to native speakers.  They were hard to get used to, but the face is covered up at all times, so that helps.  And yeah :P Our 'camp leader' was from Wisconsin, and apparently over there, they learn how to dance the polka in school. So he taught us a thing or two. Are you going to steppin' out this weekend? :P
Hello! Here is the first draft of the powerpoint.  Of course, I'm not nearly done with my half, but I thought I should send it to you before I head to church just in case you have some time to work on it. I'll be back at around 12pm to continue with it, so if you add some things, make sure to send me the updated copy. :D I think we picked a really interesting subject! By the way, I hope seeing Tim and going to the band competition went really well! (:
Oh no problem! Sorry I didn't done more on Friday/Saturday.  Oh, you can fill them out if you like too, I don't have anything specific written for them yet, they were just topics I thought we could cover :D!
Feel free to make any additions or alterations to anything so far! Oh , and I'm glad that the competition went well! 
Oh cool! :D Oh yeah, I think there might be a few sites that seem pretty dedicated to historical pictures of the children in mines. :P  It's so strange to see all the little kids at work
I have time to work on it right now, so I was hoping to finish all the  text on the slides up in the next few hours. Yeah! They're all dressed in old man clothes
Wow, I came across that one too! It makes life in the mine sound really dangerous! Do you think you'd be able to post what you have so far, so I make sure not to repeat any information?
Oh of course :D That's fine. I did the same thing first too before I wrote anything. 
May I start to add additional slide headers? I've also added more to the "mining conditions" too.
Oh cool! :D And no problem! Does it take a long time to download the attachments for you?
Okay, just wondering in case it would be inconvenient to upload new copies more often. I'm glad there's so much information to be found.
So far I've just edited the "Mining conditions" slide, and I've added a few things under "expectations" that I can continue with. I think adding a slide called "Effects on Children" might be appropriate too (I've read a few things about lower morality from working and quicker exposure to being an adult). So I could contribute a bit of information to that slide. And we could include statistics of injuries or deaths there or on a different slide.. I like what you've added so far! :D
12 to 16 besides the title and works cited slides
Awesome! and it looks like we only need one more slide after "Effects on Children" to meet the requirement. I'm not sure yet if there is any information about Switch Boys--I just saw the term used with the other jobs
Okay :D If not, I think we could use a different job such as 'breakboy' (they stopped the motorized coal carts). or just a slide that says "Other jobs" or "misc. jobs" or something of that nature that could be a "catch-all"
Cool! Right now I'm looking at a report from the National Child Labor committee from 1908--do you think that's too far out of the range of the book's time period, or is that okay?
Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be too far off :D I think I remember them talking about the populist party and McKinley--which was in 1896
I think they definitely might have!
I like the title picture. :D  Here are some additions-- I'm working on pictures now, too and seeing if there are any charts/ data tables that could apply (if you've found any other statistics, feel free to add :D -- I had a little trouble with those)  Also, I added a bit to the  Expectations slide a little & I was wondering if you had a specific year or year range to add for the $0.60 wage statistic? . I added to the Expectations slide a little* :P 
Okay! Oh yeah, the photographer would be a good addition :D Haha, slot notes would be great-- And I think that's all that Ms. Ferraraccio is expecting.  I could do slot notes for the first or last half, and then we could put them together, that way it wouldn't be as much work?  I'll add all my sources on, too.
Oh! I could do the photographer if you're okay with that! And then, if the slide notes are easy to make (are they?) then you could finish them  up?  
Okay cool :D Oh, and before you get to the "Reform" slide-- I made some minor alterations to make it less wordy
Oh cool! I've finished the photographer and my sources and I'm now adding pictures! :D
 I'll add a background design too and then send you it to look over & so you can add your sources!  . Those are pretty awesome slot notes :D I really like the arrows!. I wonder how she expects us to present in 5-10 minutes though? Do you think all the notes can be taken in that time? :D 
Yeah, the time limit is a little crazy considering the number of slides, right?
I like the slot notes a lot.. hmm.. 
I just looked at the presentation sheet to see where we were supposed to submit it, and there it was! . I could go back and fill in some more slots on the slot notes, so there is less to write? 
Yeah, there are so many interesting things to cover! I think it could be possible for us to get the presentation down to 10 minutes though, if we only touch on the basics
Oh yeah, that's true! Maybe since we have all the notes, we could cut down the slides and add in comments that seem important? That way we won't be just reading? Do you think it's worth the trouble? :D Here's the spiffed up copy. Might take a little longer to download with the extra pictures and background.
That's true :D We could simply paraphrase! And thanks--I thought the grayness really captured the bleakness of the mining lifestyle. :P
:D yay! We finished! 
Okay, Thank you so much too and good luck with any of your other homework! :D Me too, it's one more thing off our shoulders!. Here are my copies of the more-filled in notes and powerpoint with an updated bibliography that I'll submit! :D
Psst...! I got matched! To University of Virginia! :D And I was a little disappointed that I didn't get into other places at first, but now I'm really excited and ready to tell people like you!! (: I'm glad that it's closer to home and that it won't get nearly as cold in the winter. And I also learned about an awesome residential campus on UVA called Brown College that I am definitely applying too!!! Yay! :D I hope your weekend and your applications have been going well. I see that the only thing left on your status list is Sleep!, so that sounds promising! (:
Hi!!!!!! (:   It has been awhile. I hope you are having an awesome everything, and more relevantly, a great last few days of winter break!   Also, this is a little random, but Lawrence told me once to tell you that he is "pumped that you know Abby Icenhour and Nick Agentis!"    P.S.  You are wonderful ^-^
Glad to hear it! (: I am doing alright at UVA, too! There are so many things to participate in. :P  Words like 'alright' and 'great' don't tell much of the story though! Next time I'm in Blacksburg, would you be interested in meeting up somewhere to talk over tea or cookies or something?. And yes, does sound like Lawrence :P !  I met one of his friends here too!
Happy birthday, Caroline! ^-^ I hope it is fantastic amazingness!
Hi Cara! Thanks a bunch (: . I hope you are doing well too! How was your trip to Germany? Your pictures look awesome! . Estoy viajando tambien! Estoy en Chile.. Merry Christmas, Caroline!. Hello!! Don't worry, in my history it shows that you totally responded :D .   Hooray, I am glad that it arrived safely. (:  I hope that you are having a good summer too!! That would be really cool; I'm planning to be back in Blacksburg for Steppin' Out weekend!  Right now I'm in Vienna, VA, interning at Capital One. Whatabouts are you up to?. I have a software developer role and I'm working with the Inform app (inform.capitalonelabs.com) team. Everyone is very easy to work with, and there are lots of fun intern events (Busch Gardens :D), so it is a good time so far! Dog sitting is fun (: I did that a couple years ago and it was a blast! Any pictures of the dog(s)?   That's a trip to look forward to! Cassandra, right? Do you get to see her often?
Haha, yes my mom is a frequent South Main shopper :P!   That is a very cute dog!! He almost looks like a stuffed animal (: . I used to watch dog training videos on YouTube, but have never done it. Seems very rewarding! What are you working on with this pup?
Hi, Cara! I'm in town this weekend and I wanted to see you! Are you going to Steppin' Out? We could meet there, or if today is too short notice, then I'm free tomorrow as well!
Are you free any time after 5pm? I can totally give you a ride!
That would be awesome! I can pick you up at 5:30pm and we can   find parking and spend time (and eat food?) at Steppin' Out!
Okay :D I'll see you there at 5:30pm!. Leaving now, eta 5:33!. Here! I pulled up all the way :P. I found them on Youtube in case you want to try them! :D https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blogilates+pitt. Happy Thanksgiving, Cara! (:Merry Christmas! ^-^Hey, sorry I had classes from 9:00am- noon. I'm free now though!
I think there's a class in there, but I bet one of the basement tables is openCool, I found a spot in the basementShe listed it for "$70 or best offer" on the Free and For Sale page,    Oh! Good luck on both your exams, then! (: Wednesday morning works well for me, and coffee sounds good! Let's plan for that!
Okay, I look forward to it ^-^ !. By the way, around what time will you be coming tomorrow morning?
Yes, anytime after 9am works well for me! (:  See you tomorrow!
Oh whoops :P ! Just got this now. It was nice meeting with you! ^-^
Hi! Thanks, I hope you are enjoying your summer too! I haven't heard anything yet. It normally appears on the FB page or the Groupme!. Hello! I hope you have settled in nicely at the house! Unfortunately, the coffee maker I am bringing suffered a casualty on my plane ride. Sorry! :( I am not sure if it can be used without the glass pitcher portion, but I thought I should let you know ahead of time so you can make other plans. The shower curtain is a-okay though! :D I will be arriving around 11:30am on the 24th!
Awesome! I'm  looking forward to seeing you too! Have a great last few days before classes!
Hi Kristen! I was hoping you could brief me on the procedure for sending rent to Richard. Namely: The address to send the rent check, the name to put on the check, the amount of the check, and when the check must be post-marked by?   Also, I hope the start of Passport is going well! (:Awesome, thanks a bunch!Hello! (:  Thanks for your interest, but I have already found someone.  I apologize for not updating the ad with a comment or something--I'll do that now. Good luck if you are still searching for a place! Leandra
No problem! Have an awesome rest of the weekend <(")
These are some of the videos I used for physics lab! They might help if you are stuck on some concept!  https://www.youtube.com/user/onlearningcurve/search?query=lens
Hi Candace! Have you sent over your rent for July? I haven't seen yet and wanted to make sure it didn't get lost or anything!
Okay, I will check if it might have ended up in a different stack of mail! Good to know!. No sign of it here unfortunately :( . Hopefully it just got delayed!  Should we wait another week and see if it comes?. Looked up implications of a lost check, and it seems like your bank will be able to deal with it if anything happens! (though it is a hassle to call customer service...). (http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/991/i-wrote-check-was-stolen-person-whom-i-wrote-it-someone-forged-endorsement-check-and-then-cashed-it-my-bankcredit-union-deducted-money-my-account-what-can-i-do.html). An alternative to waiting would be to go ahead and send another one!  I'm okay to wait for a bit longer, depending on what you or your parents think though.
Yes, Nova! It's 8417 Amanda Place Vienna, VA 22180
Oh awesome!! Wow, it's awesome that you had a tracker on it. The other ones I got were all just stamp-based. Yeah, I will go tomorrow morning before work and see!
Kudos to your dad! They might have, but the host family I am living with probably didn't know it was for me?. Anyway, I'll let you know tomorrow :D!
No problem! I'm glad it worked out (optimistic for post office pickup tomorrow). And haha, whoops.. The pros and cons of tracking, I guess!. Could you please send me the tracking number?. Okay, they found it!! All is good (:
No worries! Have an awesome 4th of July weekend!
Yup, same procedure as last month!
Okay great! I will keep a lookout!
Okay, sweet! Thanks a bunch for doing that!
Thanks :P. Running 6 minutes late for the meeting. Driving home from rice shortly!!
Eep, a bit later actually, but by 8:45 for sure ( turning in a midterm :O) . Also thanks for the update
Oh hi!! I had trouble editing Google sheets on my phone! I am bringing a veggie tray and kettle corn popchips! I also have extra salsa in case we run out!
Thank you!. I'm coming back Sunday the 11th!
I'll be free anytime after 5:30pm!
No worries!. Thanks :D
I could potentially make it for 5-5:30!
Yeah, it's tough :O Would doing a when2meet help at all to get all the times in one place?
It's not too bad! I just made this one and it was easy! (http://www.when2meet.com/?5923719-cnghc). You can make another if we are considering multiple dates!
http://www.when2meet.com/?5923719-cnghc. The parenthesis :O
Okay, sounds good :D. Yeah,  getting everyone to do it would be tough too!
I'm on the way over now! So probably be there in 5 minutes!
Thanks! Yes, I will!!I just put the recycling out. The trash was out this morning, but I put it in because they already picked it up.I'll give you $7 cash back!. Hi Nicole! Thanks for getting rent in on time! I noticed that PayPal deducted a $13 fee for the payment though, and I think this was because you may have selected "Goods & Services" when making the payment.   I'm going to refund you the money that way you can send the payment again! This time, check that you are sending to "Friends and Family." Also, make sure to link a bank account that way there's no fee for you.  This link should help: paypal.me/LeandraIrvineGot it, thank you! (:Hi! That sounds like fun, but you may have forgotten that I will be out of town that weekend unfortunately. I am still up for 9/26 if that is a thing, though!
Awesome, thanks ^-^ ! I will be looking forward to it.
Hey! Why up so late? :P I got into the program and will definitely be going to Rome, Italy!!! (: Thank you for asking! Also, fall break went well! I went up to Harvard to visit an old friend. We went to the Museum of Fine Arts and also ate lots of good food! And for midterms--I did well on some and not so well on others. :P  How about yourself? How were fall break and classes and midterms and anything else exciting?
Oh, I plan on taking many pictures! (: Yes, let's meet up sometime-- even if it is just at the library. :P What is your tomorrow like after 4:30pm?
Neat! I could join you around then too! I'll text you to see where you are when I head over!
Thank you! I hope your winter break is going nicely! (: I'll let you know how the travels go.. Hi! Are you going to the dinner today?
Most definitely!!!. What are you doing in the meantime?
Meeting with an advisor and then doing homework!
Any chance I can study with you at Clark? Or are you going for something else?. Or.. I'll see you at the dinner :P
Oh cool!!!! Would you be up for company?
I'm not there yet, so I'd be asking you the same thing :P. Which place do you recommend, It's been awhile since I've been to Clark!
Okay cool!! I'll head over in a bit ^-^ and I'll let you know when I get there
Ah, no worries! Meet away :P. Congrats on Dental school!!
Quest bridge brunch today ;)
Yeah!! I am moving to San Francisco and working at Capital One. What about yourself?
Ooh, which are your top choices? Also, where are you living this semester?
Oh cool!! That tower fall game was the best! Oh wow, those are both really top choices.(: Wow, good job!!
Oh no. Student loans! Yes, my sis is planning to go to med school next year and knows all about those loans :O
Biomed engineer, not sure yet, she is currently applying/interviewing!Thanks! He is still looking for a job out there so I'm not sure yet! How is your gf?Hi!! For trains I used the Hyperdia app for train timetables, and for lodging I really just used Airbnb for $60 or less per night for 2 people. I made sure the Airbnb's were walking distance from a station that way we could take public transit everywhere  :D. What do you mean by optimal path through a city?
Ohh, we had the Japan Rail Pass, so we didn't have to worry about buying tickets, except for the non JR railroads, which we just bought tickets at the station for! We used 7-11s to withdraw cash!. Haha, optimal path totally depends where you want to go. As a refresher, I just went Tokyo-> Kyoto (lots of day trips from Kyoto like Nara, Uji, Osaka) -> Hiroshima/Miyajima (stopped by Kobe and Himeji on the way) -> Takayama (stop at Rabbit Island on the way) ->  Nagoya -> Izu Peninsula -> Tokyo (with Fox Village trip). Probably also look at some sample Japan routes online for inspiration if you haven't already!
No problem!! Let me know if I can help in any other capacity!<3. Aw, thanks :D such a meaningful compliment. You are pretty fantastic socks yourselfHi Rebecca! I'm pretty sure that's a backpack I ordered on eBay, so if you could set it near my desk or somewhere, that'd be awesome. I won't need it til school starts. Thanks a bunch for letting me know!. Hi, I received your August rent on the 27th through Paypal! Thanks for sending it!
No problem!  Do you mean the AC unit in the window in the basement?
That one came with the basement! It was either left by the previous tenant or put in by Richard--not sure which.
Hmm, I'm not sure whether Richard could help us with this one. Definitely use one of the extra box fans hanging around the house if you aren't already! Maybe do some minimal troubleshooting on Google if possible. Might just need cleaning or more refrigerant?  We could look into getting a new one if repair doesn't seem feasible.
Okay, I hope it goes well! Unfortunately, not much I can do until I get there when school starts, but let me know if I can help in any way. I'd definitely be willing to split the cost for a new one if it's not fixable!
Going to sleep, but please don't worry about making light/noise on your way in!
No worries! Have a great Thursday!. Goodnight! (:
Yes, I'll head back now and do it!
Moved!. I just parked on the street, it's fine!
I leave tomorrow for Atlanta, but I'm at home in Blacksburg already!
Thank you (: Enjoy your weekend too!!. My sister is in town, so I'm staying with her at her hotel tonight!
Hi Rebecca! I am in Blacksburg this weekend til Monday! I forgot to let you know sooner. Thanks for checking on me!. Whoops, sorry if I took your spot in the driveway yesterday! (Unless this different car is yours instead of Candace's)
Oh, that's so exciting! :D
Whoa!!! That must be what my boyfriend's car was painted with too--it looked very similar :P  Glad you are enjoying the new one (:. Hey, just letting you know I'm not driving back to Cville 'til tomorrow!
P.s. Are you safe? Didn't see you back last night
No worries, just wanted to make sure you're okay :D Have fun with your sister!
Okay! Thanks for letting me know and have fun!
Yup!! And then leaving tomorrow afternoon again :P
Okay, thanks for letting me know!! (:
Ah, sorry, I wasn't awake to respond to this, but yes, it is okay!
Hi Rebecca! Yup, I am planning to! But the time is indeterminate since I'm on grounds finishing up an essay :P
Hi! Yup, I'm okay! Thanks for checking on me. I just pulled an all nighter to finish up my essay so I didn't make it back last night. I should be home shortly to get some sleep though :P. Just a reminder that I am getting home pretty late tonight.  (We're in Delaware now!)
P.s. are you still alive? Didn't see you last night!
Okay good ^-^. By the way, I'm at Hack Duke this weekend! Be back late Sunday night!
Oh hi! I am in Blacksburg til Sunday. Have a great Thanksgiving Break!
Thanks!
Thanks for letting me know! He will sleep on the couch still so as not to cause a commotion or anything, but I really appreciate the offer! Good luck with that long paper :O. Whoops, forgot to let you know earlier, but I am out late tonight working on an assignment! I'll be back around 2am to sleep. Also, I hope you are feeling alright!!
Oh good, I'm glad you're feeling better! And no worries, it was fine (:
Oh hi! Yup, I did!
No worries (: I hope you caught up on sleep well!! Have a great break too!
Hi Rebecca! I am coming back tomorrow at 8:30am--I'll just be dropping stuff off in the fridge and then heading to my first class at 9am! (:
I am!. Haha, is 11pm late for me? :PTrue true! Well I'm headed home now, so I'll see you in a bit! Or goodnight if you are getting to sleep ^-^Hello! That sounds really neat :D Thanks for letting me know! Also, I hope your summer is going well. Awesome, just replied :D
That sounds great! Thank you so much for all the advice!
Heading down to the Cafe now!. Cafeteria*?
Cool!
Oh, I must've missed you, haven't started yet, I'll head in.
I'll meet you there!. Ready
Hi! I totally forgot I have stand up 10-10:30am on Fridays. Is there a way we can reschedule to a different time for the future? Looks like your calendar is pretty packed for today though, so it's fine if we miss today. Again, really sorry for the last minute change!!
That would be great!
Yay (: Thanks! Meet you by the 6th floor elevator!. Internship catchup rescheduled to Monday, right?. I have trouble with Outlook :P
Yeah, I'm still free!
Ohh, okay!. I'm free at 10:30 though, since stand up is at 10! Also free anytime outside of 10-10:20am
Awesome, thank you!
No worries!
Okay!  I'll be by 2nd flr elevators!
Yes, still works for me! I had thought you meant to move this to next Tuesday though?
Oh, I gotcha! :D Meet you downstairs?
I'm good to go!
See you down there (:. Hi! Do you know what time we should catch the shuttle to 1750 for the lunch today?
That sounds awesome! I haven't had much luck finding that app in the play store :P . Claire, Jeff, Collin and Mark Zhou (not sure if he's in hq or not) are some other interns going!
Oh cool! I got it!
It is! Thanks
Nice, got it! Good ol' Transloc!
Okay, sounds good! See you in the lobby (: Jeff is on the 6th floor so I'll go down with him
I've been in contact with Claire already and told her about the app! (: and yeah, Mark is in TC
Come now. In lobby!. Says it's arriving in 3 minutes
Hi Aditi! Any chance we can switch internship catchup to today?
Works for me!
Either is fine by me!
Sweet, I'll meet you on 2nd floor
Haha, good call! I'll do that !
Well I thought it was really useful :D . He is sending us a cloud formation template that will help us pull images from dockeryard. Sounded like exactly what I need.
Nice! I will definitely be contacting him in the future too! (:
Woo, connections!
Okay!. Hey, did you want to skip today's internship catchup and then just meet on Monday morning, since I'll have the slides by then. ?*
Okay, awesome :P. How is tomorrow at 9:30 am?
Okay great! I'll send a meeting request

That sounds super exciting :D
Seeing all the new TDPs from UVA and elsewhere is nice!. But again, I'm sorry for missing today's chat, and I will try to see you on Monday! Are you in a certain room all day, or is it a series of events?
Yes, let's do that! What time are you free?

Awesome!! I'll be sure to stop by :D
Yup! Interviewing with Facebook at 1pm :O

(: Haha, I didn't know you raced cars :O. Also, I went on an Ecology study abroad with Dave Smith and company. Did you do the Bahamas trip?. I was trying to figure out how you know Bob and Bev on Facebook :P. Haha okay, that's what I thought then but Dean Gregory said cars :P . Snowboarding is pretty awesome!!  Sweet, I bet that was a lot of fun. I went to a J-term study abroad in Belize!Oh that's neat!! What are the main activities there?Thank you!!
Hi! I'll be passing through Cville on June 5th! You could set them on my desk and I will find them on the 5th.
One for July and one for August! I'll get the September check when classes start.
Yes, I have the two!Of course! I will be posting a message on the group about rent soon...!http://lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/385_Paper.pdf. lli5ba@virginia.edu. Go team :D
Most definitely! Here is what I wrote on my course evaluation: "Professor Weimer is a really fantastic teacher. He is always well prepared for lectures, has exemplary course organization, and is a great source of knowledge for students. He always goes above and beyond when responding to students' questions and provides additional resources for us. He wants to help us succeed. He is the paragon of professors."
Hi Adam!   Did you want to meet tomorrow to work on our NLP Project Proposal?
Is early afternoon like 1-3pm good?
Okay, I'll see you then!. I uploaded the CSV! It has about 100k data points. There are additional columns at the end for annotation.  I'll try and annotate about 100 today (entries 1-100) or more if I get ambitious, and then I'll reupload it.  Could you annotate entries 101-200?. For now the Classification columns are probably the most important (rider or driver, one way or round trip, and spam or not spam). (it's in the Google drive folder)
Great! I decided to only do the classification problems until we decide how to do the entity recognition
Have you picked which sections you want to present for the paper yet?
Pick one of: Introduction or Task definition  And one of: Predicting process structures or Question answering   I am leaning toward doing the Introduction and Predicting process structues, but I wanted to see which ones you prefer, too!. (Intro and Predicting.. for ones I present, I mean)
Okay, great! I'll start making the slides for my parts then! :D
Hey Adam! What is your availability today? I was wondering if you'd be able to save the 3 trained classifiers so they can be reloaded with pickle. Also, could you combine the preprocessing steps into one method that takes a message string and outputs the X feature vector?. If you don't have time, just let me know, I think I can kind of make out all of the methods!  It'd probably involve exporting vocab1 and vocab2 as well, I think.
I'm at Hack Duke, so I can't really meet in person, but I'm free over messenger!. But if the above made sense, it would be awesome if you could make those parts!
Thanks a bunch! I'll be working on the NER and chrome extension today!
Thanks!
That's awesome, thank you so much!! :D
I'm planning on using all the pickled files to make a standalone python file library with the global classifiers and vocabularies, and then a method that takes a String and returns 3 Ints that represent the 3 classification results.. If you do have extra time, feel free to work on it, but if you're busy, no worries :D. It shouldn't be too bad hopefully. Just copy paste from here
That'd be great, thanks a bunch! I plan on using the python file in an AWS lambda function API that way it will be super easy to use in the Chrome extension!
Nice! It almost works. I'm using Python 2, so it looks like the Pickle protocol is different between versions.  Do you still have the notebook open to export pickle file versions for python2 also? Maybe just add a 2 at the end of all of them and export like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25843698/valueerror-unsupported-pickle-protocol-3-python2-pickle-can-not-load-the-file. pickle.dump(your_object, your_file, protocol=2)
Awesome, it works now!!. Thanks again!
Have an great weekend! I'll let you know how it goes (:
Great! Yeah, I might try and start a slide deck Monday or Tuesday, and I'll share that with you. We'll have a few days after break to finish the presentation prep, though!
Take your time!. There's a spot in the basement by the stairs near the Olsson underpass
Actually the basement on the other side. By the front of Rice. https://www.overleaf.com/7275084rsgxprxnpwfd
Yeah it does! No shared password needed though :P
Hi Adam! How would you like to split up the NLP paper?
That sounds good! And then I can do Introduction as well, did you want to do Conclusion & Future work?. My other sections will be Information Extraction (Location and Date) and then Interactive Map Application?
We can definitely do that! If you want to meet in person, it'd have to be this weekend though. I thought working remotely wouldn't be any problem, if not!. I think it's due on the 12th anyway :P
Oh yeah :P Glad we made it!  Yeah, I'm planning on writing most of my parts today/ tomorrow so we'll be fine (:
Sounds great!. Thanks ^-^. Oh, also! Would you rather do Abstract or Related Works?. Actually, just wrote the Abstract already :O. But I can always help with related works too if you want!
Hi Adam! Awesome, it's looking good! I've finished my part too. And definitely, I pasted in what you had written for the proposal so we can use that as a base.
That looks great! Yes, I think it's safe to say we are done!. We can both proofread it and then turn it in (:
Yup, I can do that!. Okay, I just proofread and corrected some things :D Let me know when you are happy with it and I will submit!
Awesome, I just submitted!. Nice working with you ^-^
Most definitely :D I'll probably run into you next semester around Rice even though we won't have classes together! Also have a great winter break! Will you be at home the whole time?Oh good! I hope your interviews go well! I'll be with family in Blacksburg and VA Beach, then I  doing a J-term in Belize!Thank you!!. Haha, too bad about the domain nameHey Ian! Thanks for reaching out to me. I could definitely be a TA in the class, but I have concerns about time commitment since I'm taking a large courseload. How much time would you say you spent each week with TA duties?
Hey, apologies for missing this somehow! That doesn't sound too bad as far as time goes! How was grading? Is there a very clear cut criteria/rubric to follow or did it seem like you had to use your own judgement?
Thanks! Well,  the class has definitely been one of the most useful to me, so I'll email Professor Pinckney and let him know I am interested!
Hi Ian! Yes, I did, looks like I'll be TAing next semester!. Good thing I've been working with Docker all summer!
I am at Capital One. I'm looking forward to working with you too ^-^
Hi! What's the plan for tomorrow's ISA class? Should we coordinate on the slides? I'm going to take a look today and change the picture!
Hi Ian! I'm getting my class schedule together and noticed there's a class I'm interested in adding at 3:30pm Tues/Thursday.    I could just go late to that one and still help out with the first ISA lecture with you. Would you prefer the company?. Okay, all set through e-mail.  Thanks for the quick reply!
I second that motion, since I've already read through it (: I'll let Vicente know
No problem! Yup, see you at 2 (:
5402508732. Thanks!. By the way, what did you say yesterday was the most common cause of "Internal Server Error". ?* for Django appd. Apps*
Thanks, that was it!
Oh wow, just went to work on the presentation slides and saw that you added a bunch!! Thank you so much!. Also, sorry I missed your most recent message--  The sections are data/task (8 min), model/training (8 min), and commentary (4 min)
I'll add to the slides today too(around 2pm), and then we can email them to Vicente!
Have not forgotten! Just had some heavy rain,so I could pull my phone out, but I'm on it now!. Writing you from a mosh pit :p
Actually having trouble modifying/ sharing the slides. For training, I was going to add:  Training was done on the Pulse place dataset for NYC and Chicago. And they collected Google Street view images for Chicago and. Ah, okay, but we should share the slides so far with Vicente!. Would you mind doing that? I'll have the rest of the slides done before we meet tomorrow! Thank you!!
Thanks, the slides look great! I'm running a bit late driving back to Cville. Can I meet you at 9:45 instead? In Rice 340 (if the classroom is open). Hi Ian!  I was checking out some of your grading docs as an example, but I noticed for Team #5 that I misinformed them in their docker-compose file and told them they could use the root directory! Hoping they did not lose points due to this, since it was my advice.  I can see now how it would not work for different github tags since the directory names will be different...!
Great, I'll remember to advise relative directories in the future!  Also, I hope you had a good birthday! ^-^
Hi! Vicente said he will be late for office hours (2:30pm), so we could either go later, or still meet at 2pm in case there are lots of students?
Great! See you then
Yes, outside his office!. https://qbox.io/blog/kafka-and-elasticsearch-a-perfect-match-1. https://github.com/zoidbergwill/docker-compose-kafka
That sounds the most reasonable then!. I haven't had a chance to take another look. Besides the producer/consumer, we're there any other problems?
Okay, that sounds great then!. We can add the batch container to the docket compose also
Wow, thank you! I just got home and will look over it!
Rice hall!. It's not till 11:30pm, right?. am**. Or did I misremember?
Okay, great! See you then!. Found a spot on the 2nd floor! The nook near 232. (In the back left). for file in *; do mv "$file" `echo $file | tr ' ' '_'` ; done. We are not meeting, just discussing through messages, right?
Okay, great!. Do you know what the login is for digital ocean. ?* Oh wait, I think we got it... setting up an SSH key should work as an alternative
You're good, it was a quick realization!  :P. Could you please send me the Project 7 example repo when you get a chance?. Also hope your last weekend before classes end is going well (:
Thank you!
Wait, nice jacket!! Where did you get it?Neat! :PHi. Oh man, we had a thing didn't we?
I am super sorry! I'm in Mec so I'll head over. In Sheffler's office, or?
Okay thank you!! I will take note of that. When is your one-time thing today? I was wondering how to do the laptop hand-off. If it's too inconvenient though, I can go early and get it set up on my VM!
Oh whoa, no, that's definitely okay!  I was envisioning a short meeting on grounds, not an extended trip :P otherwise I would not have asked about using your laptop.  Have an awesome time at the convention!!! (Which one is it?)
Haha, that's great. Did you compete?. The rig held up really well! We had some issue with the motors, but taking out the black capacitor thing seemed to help, and I forgot until afterwards that the yaw servo was on channel 5, not channel 4. Also, one of the back tilt servos burnt out because it was fighting the mirrored servo, so we are going to order a servo equalizer to hopefully solve that problem.. We are going to do another run tomorrow hopefully
We couldn't get a clean enough hover to try going forward, but hopefully with the yaw it will be better tomorrow!
Thanks! I think we're good for now, but did you already push the current code/build files?
Not pushed yet maybe?
No worries!. As long as the channels are 1 2 = tilt, 3 4 = elevons, 5 = yaw, that should be enough info for tomorrow flight!
Thanks!
Oh yeah, what you got?. :P
Oh that's really cool looking!! Thank you for sharing! Have you tried it out yet?Sweet! I didn't know there was a desktop soundcloud :D That would be good javascript and nodejs practice.. And everything practice! :OAwesome! Thank you ^-^ I will definitely be there! Should I bring any special clothes/shoes?
Okay, great; I will dress accordingly! See you then!. Whoa, what is this magic?. :P I've never used these before!. Anyway-- see you later :P
lol :P ! Okay, thanks (: ! I have no gloves, but hopefully I will be okay!
Hmm... Where is "behind Slaughter?" I'm in Slaughter right now.
Okay, that makes more sense! ^-^ I'll just work on homework in the meantime!. Thanks again!
Awesome! I'll head over!
Hi Jenny! It is still available! Neat, Are you going to Grace Hopper?
Yup yup! I am all registered and set to go (:
I have! I am flying with American Airlines. Currently scheduled to arrive in Houston around 10pm on the 18th! What about you?
Just sent it to your UVA account!  I booked it a few weeks back though, so it might be hard to find the exact one.
Oh, I should've let you know I had planned on using their extra airbed! But that is definitely fine and I'm so glad you were able to find a place! (:
That's awesome :D Rewards miles are the best! Well have a great rest of your summer and I will see you in school (:
Hi Jenny! I accidentally handed you an extra $20 to Peter yesterday. Do you still have that and is there anyway I can get that back from you somehow either in person or through venmo?
I mean that the $20 was mine, not for tolls :P
Yup, $80 there, $80 back !Yes, Venmo works! @Leandra-Irvine. Got it, thanks!yay! thanks a ton!
psst....
hi!! aw I was wondering.. if you're free today at 5.... hmm is it really that surprising? :P
Oh that's fine, I probably should have called :P Nice seeing you today :D lol Facebook addiction anyone?. :D
Hi! Oh, It goes pretty okay...Kinda super regular :P How is it across the ocean? That's sounds like.. super exciting! :D lol. I almost forgot about the timezone stuffs and was wondering why you were up so late/early :P (P.S. Thanks. Twe's mother told me I needed a new one :P)
Consistency is more helpful in pancake batter :P Aw, well hopefully it's been amazingly fun (: Too bad the school year doesn't go by quite as quickly as the summer break does :P   Aw yeah, I haven't seen it yet, but it's apparently gone :( I guess the caution tape did mean something after all. Now It'll just be a poor empty space. But maybe there's a bright side somewhere :P No chance of branches falling and hurting little children?  ! Have a great last day or so over there!. So, I was wondering if you would like to possibly step out with me... My phone is kind of suffering some traumatizing drowning, so I have to communicate through facebook :P Oh, P.S. : Thanks for that pretty cool postcard by the way, imagining all the cute little cats roaming around was nice (:
Okay yay! I think I can be there from about 10:00 to 5:30, and most of the day Saturday (: lol I have lots of surprises in store for when I start up my phone again :P  Yay! I'm excited to see that :P Well if you check your Facebook tomorrow morning and get this message, either message me back or call my home phone (pshh who does that anymore?) :P I'm planning to call anyways.. but yeah (: See you soon!!
Oh hi! Aw yeah, I hope it will recover soon :P Ooh! Of course I'd like to sleepover and kill bunnies :D If my mother allows, that is. omg!! I love those little graham cracker  bunnies! Well, I'll get back to you as soon as possible (: See you soon!
Whoa, thank you so so much :D! This is extremely helpful. Especially if we have a surprise essay/quiz about it. I hope your weekend is going well (:. :P lol So what are you gonna do, now that it's over?
:D! I just had a cheesecake brownie. :P I can't wait until we get a whole week of real ones! lol I'm goin' to Disneyland!!! :P Well, not really, just seemed like a popular theme. I don't know exactly what to do either. I'll just go be lazy in preparation for the summer. :D And by being lazy, I mean not doing anything too school-related. 
Yay for cheesecake! :D But um, I wanted to wish you um.. happiness in going to that awesome summer thingy!! Don't get eaten alive by New York! :D I do trust in your abilities and streetsmart skillz though. Have fun being fashionable and designy and don't forget to be awesome! :D
!!!!!!!!! Oh my goodnesss! the word dorm sounds so so so so cool! :D Is it barren besides the basic furniture, or are Parson's dorms way more fancy? lol Go make friends, Leyla! :P But yeah, it's probably just first day stuff. Maybe you guys can bond over having similar interests. :P I will understand if you have limited time to send trivial little Facebook messages. Good luck with everything still. :P It sounds so exciting. P.S. Do you by chance know if I could've left my phone in your mother's car after you so kindly gave me a ride home?
It is you :D
:D! I found my phone
lol :P I'm so irresponsible.
:P Yeah, I guess you're right. So, making some friends and stuff? :D Didja have a good ice cream social ages ago?
:D!!! That's so cool!! They're like all worldly and whatnot. Oh yeah, you take classes! I feel like you're learning a bunch! How are the "professors?"
That's so crazy! You seem very brilliant for making it in.
Ohhhh okay :P well, still. It's quite a thingy to take on then?. Do you guys work with um.. sewing machines? :P lol I'm imagining project runway, but I feel like I'm a tad off.
Sounds very intense! But a great learning opportunity! :P You'll be so knowledgeable!  And whoa!! I bet they're making clothes out of car parts right this second. :P . So with all that "intensive studying" has there been any time to see the city? Is there even time to be talking to me? :P 
That's sooo awesome! I bet you'll be more than prepared for AP Art! And I bet your portrait made her look even better somehow. :P  !! TGIF :D. lol I'll summarize the new stuff in my life in just a few statements...
um um.. I hope I haven't told you any of this yet or I'll feel a little awkward. but um...   Blueberry picking, Road Driving!, Salem Fair (I went on rides!!!!), Got a Bike!, Rode the bike :P!. Pet a bunny at a Pet store!. :p. that's about it.
:P I went to Crow's Nest. It was kind of quaint and neat. And the blueberries were huge!!
Ohh It's fine, I hadn't heard of it until recently either! It's like, a plant nursery past our high school on Prices Fork. It's some obscure turn off on the right.
Oh my goodness! That's just insane! You'll have to catch up with the fun sometime. :P I'd say you're really not missing too much though. It's just kind of neat to see all the rows of bushes and everything. Ah, I better go eat some food right about now/get to sleep. :P Or maybe both--at the same time. Good luck with your studies and have fun in New York!! Oh, and I never got to ask--How is your dorm-buddy? :D
Oh totally! :P There'd be sooo many blueberries. :P lol When you say it that way, it just sounds awful. I might've been imagining some sleepwalking eating. :P I'm not sure if I'm capable of such awesomeness though. Seems like a time-saver.  And thats sooo neat! Are they worldly as well?
Oh why thank you. :P Your compliments mean a lot to me.  Whoa!! Canadian buddies! :P French is a very nice sounding language. :D And mustard brand.
:D I better get to that multi-tasking. :P I talk to you later hopefully! :D Ttfn.
:D!!! That's very cool! lol connections all over the world are handy.. G'night! :D
Don't let the bed bugs bite :D. sorry, had to finish it :P. See ya.. Emphasis on the abstract? :P Since it is for homework, here is my very serious answer. :P Awesome profile picture by the way! um.. I look for noticeable deterrents like alarms that sound, lights that go off, the sound of a dog barking, or intimidating locks. I feel like those might be best at preventing theft because if the thief is determined and has a chainsaw, all a security system can really do is either slow them down or scare them off. Another cool feature to have might be the alarm linked to a police station, so that the police will be notified in an emergency. That'd probably scare off the chainsaw wielding thief too. :P . oh, the same could go for vandalism. Anything that calls attention to the site of the 'vandals' would probably scare them off. :P
oh, no problem. Anything to help out. :P Whoa. Is it a um.. very *secure* shoe? :P
oh wow!! I've always loved that myth (especially when they did it on Out of the Box forever ago.) And the only part that really sounded silly was the myth, but it is a pretty silly myth. :P I think the project sounds awesome and knowing you, the shoes are going to be as amazing as anything! That's a crazy good idea too! :D It sounds like there's a bunch of possibilities and I wish you good luck for tomorrow. :P I hope to see pictures of all your projects at some point. :P oh and thanks for taking the time to share all that with me! :D  I just started that "Summer Med. Camp" at the Osteopathic College today and it was a fun experience, though the workload is not nearly as intensive as your summer program. The cadaver lab still takes some getting used to. I'm becoming quite familiar with latex gloves. :P G'night for now. :P
Maybe obscurity is exactly where you want to be. And in any case, it sounds better than mediocrity. :P Whoa, I wasn't aware that you have a Deviant Art! :P oh yeah, it's kind of weird looking at the cadavers, but they're not really identifiable, so I guess it's not as bad. The camp is about a week and it's a day camp (9am-4:30pm) at VCOM(Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine.) There are people there from all over the county(just girls though), and the ones who are more than 45 minutes away are staying at a Comfort Inn here. The counselors are med students and they're all really nice and funny (I guess doctors have to have good social skills :P). The head honcho is a guy from Wisconsin and his accent in hilarious. Kind of sounds Canadian. He's going to Polka for us soon! :D So far we've done some lectures on major body systems like the lung, heart, and bones. We worked in the cadaver lab both days and today we saw some of the sim dummies, did some demos with them, and experienced one giving birth to a baby dummy. :P The lunches are good too; we made all out banana splits today! :D Sorry for that long summary there. Surprisingly, there is more to mention, though they're just small details. :P  Whoa!! There are Rite Aids in New York? :P That is a crazy expensive price though unless they were equipped with some high tech features like a self-cleaning system or something. :P Most cheap disposable ones go for about $3 a box as far as I know. lol must be all the inflation. :P lol sorry, that was supposed to be a pun type thing, because you can blow latex gloves up like balloons. :P 
I guess cadavers are definitely not something I would have to opportunity to be exposed to on a regular basis? :P Oh, we had to take notes and sit through some lectures, but there wasn't really time to assign homework I guess. VCOM is right between Blacksburg and Christiansburg--it's technically part of Blacksburg (Even though I hadn't even heard of it before this year :P).  lol, a honcho? Well, there have been misconceptions that a honcho defects rain...but in spite of those, it's actually a term often heard in western films meaning "an important person or leader." as in the phrase "head honcho." lol sorry, I wasn't sure if you were kidding.. oh yeah, Canadian accents aren't always like the ones that we Amurican people think of. :P I do like "aboots" and "ehs" though. :D Oh yeah, maybe I'll have time to tell you all about um, Noelle the birth simulator. :P  psh, well 'Intensive studies" are way out of my league, so maybe we're even. :P !!! And I looked through all your art and photography on your profile--it's all very very very awesome and talented (even if I've seen some of it before.) and I'm excited to see whatever new works are added. :P  
:D!!!!!! In response to your question mark exclamation point combo, I would be so interested. And I have no plans as of yet besides me definitely going. :P I hear that the lead guitarist of the Dave Matthews band will be making an appearance on stage. :D exciting stuff. hmm, you're going to do some Steppin' Out too, right?! :D P.S. Head honcho is definitely maybe a common phrase, :P I wish I had a picture of Noelle, and your Parson's stuff looks super duper professional and amazing! o.o!
I'm going to both day, too! And yeah, it's pretty crazy. :P Sometimes I'm bad at appreciating good music though, so I'll try to listen more this year. It sounds big and stuff :D P.S. lol I still can't understand how you haven't heard that word very often. I wonder where I've heard it from then :P Probably from cartoons--that's where I learn everything. :P (kidding of course).  Well there are images of Noelle online, but I don't know if you're ready for this yet. Could give you some pretty horrific nightmares. o.o 
Oh my goodness, that would be soo awesome. I'm totally interested  :D! lol Cody wears Yoda shirts. I could go as soon as it starts (11?), but I'm not sure how many other people will be there that early. :P Maybe this year I should only go a few hours in when everything is up and running and there are actually peoples there. I'm not positive though. :P  yups, I think so. lol, but there's nothing wrong with starches of the spud variety. :P Oh yeah, it is.. still less scary that the evil chuckie doll though o.o
That was fun stuff. :D School is coming crazy fast though. o.o I'm glad that we at least get to see our schedules. Speaking of those.. how's yours look?. oh and, nice picture :D
:D!!!! Cool stuff, I have 4th Period Spanish 4 too. :D But I think that's about it.. hmm, maybe calculus too.. I gotta check again :P. Oh cool :D Calculus too!. That's awesome :D
pstt... :D
!!!! Leyla!. :P
:P oh yeah, lol it's fine though, You're my choice for homework help too :D (or any other help for that matter). I hope this isn't about calculus though :P because I'm at a loss for that
you're really really helpful :D! like with history today :D That saved me from hours of struggle. ooh, I can help with that one :D. what about the question?
oh nos :P lol my answer for that one was a little silly because I didn't think he would grade it too harshly. I said that we added the concept of year 0 based off of the Mayan calendar. And that we use it to translate mayan dates into gregorian ones :P like December 12, 2012
I don't mind at all :D And yeah, he's pretty easygoing though, so effort is key :P . http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/maya/chap1.htm#5 . here's a site I used for the "starting at 0" thing. http://www.jqjacobs.net/mesoamerica/meso_astro.html. And this one was tough to read through, but maybe you could pull out something. :P
:D no problem! I'm glad it actually is helpful :D and don't spend too much time on it, Senor will be understanding
:D me too, I'll remember to ask my mom for my songs back :P
Whoa. I'm really sorry I missed that last message :P It looked important. I think that's when I mysteriously fell ill though.  but anyways, I just wanted to with you a super duper Merry Christmas!!!! :D And yes, your family is totally hanging on my fridge :P  Have an amazing day!
Whoa. So um. I just watched an episode to this one TV series called "Chuck...." And it's kind of ending next week in a crazy series finale. o.o I think that's pretty insane. :P
Oh me too :D It feels so short, especially since I've missed about half of the episodes. :P I guess I just hope it ends all happily with a nice house with a white picket fence and fun stuff. :D Whoa, good question. o.o Hmm.. I don't suppose there's another show about Zachary Levi starring as a nerd who gets initiated as a spy? :P
lol :P 'with cute little children' sounds nice.  And whoa!!!! Those lookbook profiles are really brilliant! Thank you for sharing. :P Oh, and here are the files. :D Hopefully the quality goes over okay through facebook. If not, we can surely make other arrangements!. *attachments in progress :P*. Downloading and zooming in on them may make the words able to be seen :D
Oh yeah, hmm.. You could type the first have and I the second, approximately. And then we could consolidate. They're not quite due Monday, so we could both print them and then bring them in to be edited, then we could consolidate through facebook. :P If accent-usage isn't impaired.   Psh, don't worry about it, I don't believe in owe-ing things. :P  Although muffins are quite nice. :D . Have a good night and everything! hmm, I was hoping the snow would be more effective today, but it hasn't left a trace :P
Ah, i feel that my weekends have been gobbled up by homework for the time being. It's not so bad though. I hope your paintings/drawings/masterpieces are. coming along nicely! Lol :P And the matchmaking service! I reckon your prediction is correct. Oh my, I know what you mean! The wind has been. pretty vicious and ravenous today! :P Anywho, goodnight for now and don't let the wind get you down :D
Sorry it took so long, but it's all consolidated and printed :D. Good luck with arts stuffs ! . wait, I've fixed it :P
Ello!!! Happy first non-school dayish! Oh, and that's quite alright! I had no special attachment to that slip of paper. But thank you so much for sending me the information on it. :D! (:. Have a super nice day!
:D!!!! I wanted to thank you in person, or something more special, but it just can't wait any longer. :P   Thank you so so so so so much for the present!! :D!! It's like the awesomest thing ever! (especially the packaging!!) And it brought me great joy to pull out of the gift bag! I definitely wasn't expecting a super-cool gummy bear that spreads sunshine everywhere! :D hehe, you press its tummy and it lights up!! :D So thank you dearly for the thoughtful gesture of an amazing birthday present!!! ^-^  Good night for now, ol' buddy, ol' pal :D!
I hope you're having a nice spring break so far! Have you travelled and seen things yet?
Cool! The no school aspect might be enough to make it a nice spring break! I hope you have some safe travels, then. I've always liked long car trips. :P My break is going well! We didn't win in the MACC tournament; but we had to go to the tie breaker round and it was crazy! And I visited my dad in Radford, and then Twe and I went to all those places. I think she's going to help me make a cake for my sister's birthday tomorrow. :3 It's a good break so far. We should kill bunnies sometimes. 
:D I believe you may have made a super cool Art Project Cake in the past! And thank you, I'll let her know that you wish her well! Whoa (: I would definitely be interested if it worked out! Again, have a super nice trip everywhere! :D
:D I bet it was a yummy as it was aesthetically pleasing! And okay, I will be sure to check my facebook regularly. :P. Here is a copy of what we have so far! We can paste it into a word document at any point, but I thought downloading it each time might be too much trouble :P  Hello everyone!  Welcome to the class of 2013 Senior Program!  We'd like to thank you all for coming out and joining us in celebrating all of our accomplishments in making it this far.  This year has gone by so fast, yet at the same time, this moment couldn't have come soon enough!  It has been a long journey, but we appreciate all of the support you've given us along the way.  (We couldn't have done this without)...All the wise words of advice and endless encouragement.  And to all the seniors:  Cherish this moment that may well be the very last time we'll all be huddled together in this familiar Middle School gym!   
:D! I like this very much . with IAN DAVIS of couse.. course*
As we move on to bigger and better things, or just everyday adventures, we'd like to say.. It's been good, guys.  :P Hehe maybe it is an adequate conclusion?   
Yay! :D  I especially like the ensuring justice on the playground. Any kid whose judicial system consists of rock paper scissors is okay in my book. :P
I've never thought of it like that. If only solutions for an older age group were as simple :D . Oh, this is random, but I didn't want to spam up the group message :P  I was talking to Mr. Hawkins today and 'Candyland' came up, and it made me think of the last time I played, which consequently happened to be with you a very long time ago, Leyla :P
!! That would definitely be a blast from the past! Do you still happen to have a whole closet full of board games? I was always amazed by how many there were :P
I guess it's been awhile since our last killer bunny get together, but that's definitely reassuring!
Yay! :D I hope to live all my summer days to the fullest this summer!
Ah, "last" moments! I'll be sure to do something mildly productive or at least lots of fun everyday! :3 Tomorrow I am mixing some concrete for the backyard patio! :D I guess I better get to sleep for that right about now. I'll send Ms. Stevens that email too!
Well it's never too late! :3 By the way, while I was looking up her email address, I happened to notice your picture on mcps.org! Congrats on the award! :D! And no problem!
You're so great! :P 
Aw, thanks :3 I hope that I turn into a beautiful butterfly one day like the caterpillar on A Bug's Life!
hehe, thank you. Maybe the changing can happen at any time if it's inside us all along! Ah, the profundity! Today I was wondering what I've learned from high school besides knowlege
:D I hope so too! I asked a few people, and my favorite response came from Daniel, who said that he learned to be himself. :D  And yes, it'll be interesting to think that those speeches will now be directed toward us! 
Me too. I think I'll be doing some more soul searching, but I know who I want to be, and to be "true to myself" (Mulan moment!) :P  Well, I'm too sleepy to think of a good segue, but I'l going to turn in for the night! (Whoa, did that turn out to be a segue on it's own?) :D Ttfn!. (Oh wait, keyword "good" segue) Ah, technicalities. :P Night!
:P Byebye!. Oh hello! Just letting you know what you missed yesterday! -Reminders for sending in your quote if you haven't yet, and bringing 60 cookies to the senior program tomorrow (I believe that we are supposed to bring them to the practice in the morning so they have them ahead of time, but I could be wrong) -Turn in a $20 deposit for a stole if you haven't already -Come to the practices on Thursday and Saturday at 9:45am in order to set a good example for other students -And she said we will find more out about how the senior program and graduation ceremony will work out during the practices -And that's about it :D!
Aw, I'm sorry I've missed this! Thank you for letting me know though! I hope you had fun. ^-^ Will Seneca still be in town for longer?  (By the way, my phone had a little run in with the rain, so he's recuperating in a bag of rice right now, so it was great of you to facebook message me too! :D)
Yay! Until August is awhiles to be in town.  (: And I think it had the nicest recovery I could've hoped for!. I wanted to share this wonderful ad on craigslist with you. http://blacksburg.craigslist.org/zip/3913945390.html It's beautiful, really.. :D
hehe, it inspired me too! I'm glad you liked it!  Is your summer going well? Anything new happening? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! The road will have a new awesome driver on it! :D And no more braces sounds like flossing will be easier! And that movie is wonderful! I just found out who my suitemates are for UVa and am going to orientation soon, and then to Williamsburg!
:D! Oh yeah, I'll be meeting my new classmates!  Wow. Summer's really flown by in the last few weeks! And you must know quite a lot about Williamsburg! I don't have many plans; so far just going to Water Country USA. Surely there is much more to do though! Do you have any recommendations?
I've only been there once when I was small.  Nowadays, I think I'm too scared for the big rides at Busch Gardens, so the water park sounds perfect (Lazy River here I come!).  :D! I'll be sure to visit the downtown area then! Oh! All those "Ye Olde" stores we went to in 4th grade were so neat, too! . Hello! (: This is pretty short notice, but I have an invitation for you!  If you are not doing anything tonight, Twe and I are having dinner at Gillie's at 7pm to chat about how our lives are going. ^-^ I can give you a ride if you need, and don't feel bad at all if you have other events to do already--Rain checks are accepted! (:
That is alright! (: I miss you, too and I can't wait to hear how everything is going! Have a nice remaining time in Blacksburg!. Hello! I hope your winter break is going nicely! Have you had some fun adventures?
I'm glad it's been going well! (: It would be awesome to do that! This is bad timing on my part, but I leave for school tomorrow at 10am. :P I am free today before and after dinner, but there is always next time too!. Ahh, video games and killer bunnies! I've been missing this from my life for too long :P. And you!
That sounds awesome! I am going to dinner with my family at 7, so I might be able to catch you guys before you leave Gillies. I'll text you later if I'm able to! (: 
Whoops, I meant 6--! :P . It was nice seeing you guys! ^-^
I hope the same for you! (: Have a safe trip back to Chicago when you go!  It was pouring on the drive back to UVA. :P
Hi friend! Thank you for the nice birthday wishes and Pusheen picture :D !! I hope you are having an amazing time in the Centennial State!
Hi there ole friend, ole pal. (: You are wonderful; thank you for the condolences.  It's such an indescribable feeling. Before, I had seen funerals as just a formality, but the one I went to yesterday was anything but. It was a great event, though so bittersweet. "It is impossible to say just what I mean!" (Oh, Prufrock..!)  I miss you too and would like to keep in touch! We can share our viewpoints and life goals and such. Or just little things and daily happenings. To start-- For Columbus Day weekend, I visited Lawrence at Harvard and saw the Goya exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts!
My trip to Harvard was great! We had cannoli, took the subway, looked at old books, and ate at fancy restaurants. It was neat seeing Lawrence after all these years. He is really well-read and always seems to know what to say about life (so wise!).   Potlucks and homemade food are awesome. ^-^ I am impressed by your homemade salsa! How crazy that  you've never made it before considering all of our Spanish class festivities! :P   So far, I visited Sinkland Farms with Peter and we made pumpkin soup! For Halloween I am planning to somehow dress up as Wendy from Peter Pan. There is also a "Roaring 20s Murder Mystery Dinner" going on at my house, which should be fun! Do you have any Halloween plans?
Leyla! ^-^ I hope your birthday has been fantastic amazingness!! I drew you this elephant because elephants are good birthday party guests.. Whoops! Just realized I put the wrong date (2014 instead of 2015). Still adjusting to the new year... :P
Haha, with that mentality, we had better start thinking its 2016, so we will be on time for next year! :P   And thank you!  Have you had a fair share of snow recently?
Hi Leyla! It's awesome to hear from you! Thank you, and I apologize all the same.  I just got a smartphone recently, so that might help me stay connected! Do you recommend snapchat? :P  I hope your summer in Chicago and classes have been awesome!!  I am on my way to Chile right now...!
I will have to try it!! I am here for a data science school for a week. So far, I rode a horse on the beach and made tacos with everyone! I am getting plenty of Spanish practice!. I hope so; he is from Chile, I remember! My time here is definitely motivating my bilingual interests. :P What are you up to in Chicken?. Chicago* haha :D
Merry Christmas, Leyla!
I am doing well! The past semester was a lot of fun!  My mom and sister and I are spending Christmas in Virginia Beach with a family friend and my bro. I'm excited to travel to Paris for J-term in two days.   How are you doing? (:
Aw, tough acedemically or other things?  Oh yay, I am glad you are home!! (:
It's not over-sharing, don't worry!! Oh nos, I am so glad you are getting/got treatment. That is some serious stuff! 
Ah that's such a cute sheep! And hopeful is good . With friends and family, anything is possible!! :D.  I am taking "A History of the City of Lights." In which we read about and tour the city to get a deeper, non tourist perspective of Paris!
Thank you! I hope you have a great holiday break too! (: Will you be home for longer or Chicago or elsewhere?
Oh wow! Well have a safe trip back! :D I'll send you some glimpses of Paris during my stay!Aw, Hi Leyla!!! (: Thank you!! I hope your Chicago summer has been fantastic too!. Merry Christmas!  (:Yes, I can help to the best of my ability as long as it's not 13-15 :P.  Sorry I'm a bit late responding to this!
I experimented a bit and I got (r+2)^3 ! Is yours a cubed root too?. Or I mean, a cubed polynomial thing.
Awesome!
I started with the constant number in the polynomial (8), and thought about it's factors (1,2,4,8). And I made 3 "factor cheeks" : (r + ?)(r + ?)(r + ?)   << I knew they had to be pluses in between because the 8 is positive.   First I tried 2, 4, and 1 where the question marks are, but when I plugged in the root -1 into the original equation, it didn't work, so I knew that it had to be 2, 2, and 2 in the parentheses!. (If this doesn't make complete sense, don't worry too much--Johnson said the factoring should be "transparent" on the test :P)
Just reviewing the notes and making sure I know how to tackle all the major types of problems (Undetermined Coefficients, Variation of Parameters, Higher Order Differentials, Linear Dependence, and Spring problems)
I'm not a genius, I just use Paul's Math notes and it groups them into categories. :P http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Vibrations.aspx  Reviewing would be cool! The only most free slot I have would be 1:00-2:00pm, right before my Discrete Math class in the MEC building though
Alrighty.  And you only multiply if it's repeated; I didn't have to in this case.  Could be something went wrong when setting all the sin() or cos() coefficients equal to the sin() or cos() coefficients in g(t)?
Okay, awesome!
What do you mean by one equation?. (sorry)
Oh man, it's tough to tell without looking at it. http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/UndeterminedCoefficients.aspx  Maybe some of the examples on this page may help? :P
:P That's information for you. It's as interesting as you make it!. Johnson is pretty good at making his lecture notes interesting regardless though :P
I think the ones on finding the complex roots have been the most helpful to me so far! And yup, it happens :P...  I like this one too: :3.  But differential equations is not a suitable topic for it!. Okay, I'm gonna go now! :D Any other  last minute questions before?
No problem, always happy to help ^-^ Oh, the test is on Thursday, but I will keep that in mind for then! (:  Good luck with the rest of webwork!
Haha :P Okay! Well I'll be around that area at 1:00pm if you want to find me :D (I'll probably be hanging in room 214 because it's empty around that time.) See ya!. Hey man, I don't think I can be there until 1:20 if you were planning on meeting me :( I've gotta head to Newcomb and back to mail some packages (packaging them took longer than expected)!   Sorry about this!
Thanks, you!. I drove it here over the weekend!
Happy Birthday!!!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0icUprLYFcU. :P A bit late, sorry!
I miss you too Jahil!! Congrats on graduating :D Where are you now?
Sweet! You have a job :D !!!!!. I am in McLean/DC area interning at Capital One! I like it so far!
Yes, Google ^-^ !! One day...
Whoa, how do you know this?
Oh, haha! :P
Ah, I am sorry I missed you! I thought you were still in Lynchburg!. Ah, I got it.. Richmond for the summer.. Well I might be in Richmond again I hope (:. Hi! How much did you buy your skateboard for?. https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/spo/5674728388.html. I'm looking at getting this one, but I'm not sure if it's a good price and so on.
No way, that would be sweet! But I  won't be in Richmond for awhile and I am halfway into buying one now (already messaged them).  I wouldn't mind doing a skate session with you sometime though :P Do you ever do ramps/pipes or tricks?
Totally agree about the elbow and knee pads! Also shin guards work wonders for kick flips. I would wear a full body protective suit if it were practical :P. Nice! What's up in cville?
Aww, nice (:. The latest flare video... :P Let's do it!You're in town??? :D!!!!That sounds awesome! How about a 1-2 hour session on Thursday? I'm free outside of 2-5pm!
Yeah, it's DADA :P After that is great then. 5pm?
5:10pm then? :D
Sounds great! See you there!. Hey, is it alright if I invite Tanul to join us in studying?
That sounds good! I will start looking when I get there, but if you find one first, let me know!
Open space on 4th floor!!. In the back right nook
On Saturday I am going to the National Mall and then playing Battlefront at a friend's house.  What are you up to?
Awesomeness! Any good two player games?Which are your favorites?. Also, I'm going to the food truck festival today!. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_rbf_parameters.htmlHello Dr.Wu...!  :P I hope it was a good experience for you too.  I think I will most likely be going!. (By the way, when did we become Doctors?)
In that case.. you are a double doctor :D !
Oh no, nothing can beat that! :P. Also, why are you up so late?
Alas! Is it one of those dreaded, but interesting, and undoubtedly time consuming written LaTEX homeworks?
Oh yes, I look back on the mirth and time spent huddled around Floryan's office quite fondly! (: Fun times, indeed.
Glad the tradition has continued :D Not a problem, I'm up anyway! Good luck on getting through that last bit of work before spring break! G'night!
Oh man, that sounds awesome, but unfortunately, if you mean this Friday, I will be out of town!
Rain check if you want though! Especially if it is Runk ;P
You bet, Wu <insert pun> !  Is there a day when you usually frequent Runk for dinner?
Nice! Perhaps Wednesday? I'm done with classes at 6:15pm, so anytime after that (and +10 minutes since I can't teleport yet).
I'll be there, not square!  Wha! How did I not think of that yet? We'll discuss more over noms.
Still up for me to join you for food tonight? :D
Neat! I'll see you at 6:32pm then ^-^.  Where exactly am I meeting you?
Fun! Can't wait :D
Oh yeah, that Kevin who bboys  :P
Hehe, so pro! . Thank you for dinner...!
Whoa, that is such awesomeness! I will let you know :P ! Also, the DDR is tempting...!!
Which leads us back to the teleporter....  I'm out of town >.<. But I will experience da bomb another time I hope :D!!!!!
You too Prof Wu!. Oh whoops!! Totally remembered that I said I would be in town during the weekend of HackUVa, so that's probably why you asked about DDR -- but I thought that was next weekend. -.-. So sorry about that :P. I mean, I am out of town this weekend, but next weekend is still game!!. I thought HackUva was next weekend :P. Thank! Have a holly jolly weekend, yourself and a good hackathon too, if you are going!!. Haha :P That looks familiar!!
Friday!
Whoa, whoa, are we eating food first and then playing DDR?
The whoa, whoa was because dining hall food is exciting :D Sounds like a good time!!
Thanks Prof James. I too have full faith in you concerning matters of the universe!. Mos Def!  Still 7:30 at Runk?
Oh.. I meant 7:32pm
Still alive, by the way!
Twas much fun!! Have a fun run :D
Oh, tempting...!. How was your run today, by the way?. That sounds like craziness!
Totally worth it then!!. Hmm.. what time would said run be?
Like I said, it's tempting... but I'll decline this time, partly because I am unconditioned (3 miles be like :O), partly because I'm planning on swimming tomorrow and don't want to do two workouts in one day (:P) .   Do you really run everyday? Maybe another day I will be more up for it!!
Okay sweet! What time do your normally run on weekdays?
Neat-o! :D I'll let you know if I ever feel like running ^-^
DDR Part II?. Oh dude!!!! ^-^. The cuteness!!
Inspiration from the greats!
Yes!!! The ice cream is magic.

7:14 PM is a fantastic time! Where to meet?
That would be amazingness! . Also, I happen to have a car this week...!
The end of the school year approacheth! :D You can do it!
May I offer you a ride to Runk in Charlottesville's orangest car?
Ooh, I remember there is parking at the Student Activities Building!
Sweet :D I guess you could even bring the games if you don't mind them sitting in the car! How is 7:08? And you're at 1815?
Oh, should I pull into the parking lot,. ?*. *whoops, had my data turned off!
Thank you for all the fun times!
So true! Maybe one day, I will walk a marathon :P
Hehe :D So close...!. That reminds me of the forehead oreo Minute to Win it!

Oh yeah? Where do you recommend?. hehe, was going to say, looks like you were at the museum pretty recently based on that plane picture! (or was that the hangar?). Galaxy saving is much fun!. Awesomeness!! Which day is the best for you? Friday and Sunday are both good for me! Also, my place is open to use if needed, but my TV is on the small size.
Worklife :o. Saturday is good! I will be sure to make the best impression with your cat!!
Goodnight, Professor!. Is our usual after dinner a good time? How late would be acceptable to stay? Also, as long as you have parking, I can drive :D. That sounds totally cool!  Wait, dinner at your house or going to a place for dinner? Either would be neat!. Aw, sounds so nice! ^-^

Thank you :D Happy first day to you!!. Life hack of the day!
No way dude!! :D Looking forward to TAing for that!!
Whoa, thanks! Probably one of the largest audiences I have talked to. The TA life, huh?
Thanks for the complement! I'd love to hear you speak sometime :D. Even more reason to see you speak! :P
I bet you're actually an awesome speaker! And I am! I'm doing independent research.
Ahh, so cool and creepy all at the same time!!

Ohh, is there a way to find out whether Rice 340 or 536 (project room) in particular are free?
No worries then, thanks for the assistance!
Ohh, at first I was like.. "What does the crem command do?" But I think I understand it now!!. The best apt program there is!
The real question!. !!! I've been doing Cracking the Coding interview questions :D. *feeling accomplished*. Hehe :P I got someone to blackmail me as motivation.. P.S. Did I see you at the AFC this morning or nah?
Wow, so cool!!
I was! I always hang out by the mats.
Awesome, only 23 "hello"s until I reach level 2!. in conversation skills?. Aww, thanks ^-^. Goodnight for now!
Thanks for the invitation!!! I'll be in Blacksburg this weekend though.. But have so so much fun!
No problem! (: Is a mini drone in your future?. Hooray ^-^. It's going well!! I'll definitely have to brush up on my Django coding, though!  How was your TA session on Thursday?. Or wait.. was that Tuesday? :P
Oh yeah!! Is this the first Python 1110 class to come to 2110?. The first foray into new languages! :o Before that was left to C++ in 2150.
Haha :P Pointers and referencing are still a rough spot for me, for sure.. I'll just have to watch that claymation again :P
We filmed the first clips for that today!
Haha#!!!!!! :P I never knew the range of my talents...

Even better!!! (: Filled with marshmallows?
Ceiling, floor, wall? :O. Sounds like a good docker container name
You must find them and befriend them!

Or a really long marker?. !!!! YES!!!
Happy Friday to you too,  Professor!! :D !!!!!! Any weekend fun plans for you?. I'm going to Atlanta for a music festival!!. Hackathons have their own place on the fun spectrum (:
Oh, no problem!!! I wish I could've figured out what was up... I think your point of contact would totally understand!!. Aka no points off. I think if anyone could solve this... Prof. Pinckney could!
Okay, awesome!!!!. Oh yeah!! Where's your DevPost submission?
Yay!! :D
That looks really nice!! :D Good job ^-^. :D!! It'd be fun to use the app you made ^-^. And to do good?. Miracles happen!
Wu!. DDR is always a much anticipated activity ^-^. Okay, sweet!! And next weekend is most likely off limits too (fall break ventures!)... but the one after that, perhaps?. Yip! Fall Break!! :D  And that sounds good.. Doing something fun this weekend?. Eh?
!!! So just skip school in between?. And stay home for longer?. :P. hehe, just kidding
Technically speaking, that makes a lot of sense!!. My availability this weekend is still unknown. o.O. Whee ^-^ !
You too!!. I'm having dinner with WiCS and Tychonovich tonight :D. Tychonievich*. Whoops
Haha, I wonder what we will talk about :O. Well anyway, have a good rest of Wednesday :D !. Ahhh, the clones :P
I hope you have a great break too, Professor!. Hi James :D The Capital One interview was great. I went to a Power Day in Richmond that consisted of 3 sections, behavioral, case, and technical.  I felt like the technical part was not too challenging and it involved an OO design question and another question that used a stack.  For the behavioral interview, you should practice questions like "Tell me about a time when you solved a conflict." and review experiences on your resume.   For the case interview, you should watch the Captial One Case Interview video on YouTube.
Yes!! :D Which day is good for you?. Saturday would be good since I'm planning on going to the Observatory on Friday night!. Yes! 5:41pm is a wonderful time ^-^. Can we play that crashing game again too? :P
Always happy to help!! :D I'm sure your grader will be amused by your function names!. "all_hairs". Mochi!!!. Teehee. P.s. would you like a ride to theRunk today?
Back in action! :D. Awesome! Do you know where you'll be around 5:35pm today?
Okay!! I'll meet you by the bball hoop like last time!
:O Options? https://www.facebook.com/events/1785615774984394/
*checks menu at Runk*
Haha :P  Do you like ramen and dumplings? :D. Ah, let's do it ! :O !. I can sponsor you since you always got my back at Runk!
Aw, when will I ever get you back, then?
Haha, does that happen often?  Well I'll pick you up at 5:46pm instead!
!! Great :D I'll make sure the back seat is nice and comfy gor them
See you!. Heading over from Rice Hall now! I'll message when I arrive!
Here! 1-10 or 11-30M
Haha, no worries!. Bok choy Suggs!. By the way, is 5-6pm okay instead? Forgot I had something 4-5. 3-5*
Oh good! I'll see you 5-6pm then (: Goodnight and thanks for all the fun/knowledge.. Somewhere in Rice! I'll check if the Security Labs is open!
Hmm, not open, maybe Mech lounge?
Oh yay!! I'll come meet you! I have an expo marker
https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview. Just what we need!
7:30-8:30, but if you can come earlier, feel free.. Haha, and if you've got too much going on, I can always do that Hacker Rank page!
Hooray!. Woo! Heading over to Rice!
340 looks promising!. P.S. I am also free 12-3pm in Rice 436. Letting you know just in case noon works better for you than 1pm!. Otherwise, I'll see you at 1pm if you're still free! :D
Okay, enjoy class!
Oh, I am MIA, I'll head over now!. Feel free to ready the whiteboard!
Ah, thank you!! I have a long way to go as an interviewer so thanks for bearing with me! (:
For tomorrow, did you want to meet at 7:30pm in person? Or we can do a phone interview at 9:20pm.
Haha, one or the other, since 9:20pm assumes that I left Charlottesville around 9:30pm.. Although both would be awesome!!. :O. left around 6:30***. Okay, that sounds good!! We can setup an interviewing Google doc :P
Ah, so cool!! One day...
Sure will!. (:. Thanks!. Looks like 9:45pm is a better time! Is that okay for you?
Wu!. I made it home and am ready for interviewing when you are. Let me know when you're in a place where you can use speakerphone/headset.
Sure thing! Have a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview and access to the Google Doc?. Thank you :D
Okay! :D
Okay!. Oops, microphone issues? I"ll call you through my phone instead of laptop
I could hear you though!. Nothing?
Aw, Facebook doesn't like me
Okay.. phone call it is. :O. What is your phone number?
Haha :O. Was the conference useful?
Awesome! That works for me :D Pro-level in no time!
That works too! I can only do until 2:30 though, so we'll just have to really stick to the 30 mins per person thing :P. It all works for me, so just whenever you are available :D!. (before 2:30 :P). 1:11 is good :D
Ready ready!
Yeah!!
Awesome! I'm free 12-3:45pm and after 6pm!
The perfect interviewing time!. Ready soon!
Ready!. Can you hear me?. :P
Phone number?
Thank you!!
Oh hi!. Ooh, that might be neat.. do you happen to have parking possibly? :O
Thanks!. That is okay!  (Also, sorry I'm late, staying a bit longer at OH)
There is always the epic phone interview...!. Oh right!! :O. Haha, I am leaving tomorrow at 4pm though, so I probably wouldn't get to cooking it until the weekend anyway.. I can pick you up and we can use a whiteboard at Rice!. If you happen to have the time! If not, phone interview!
Ah, but walking so hard :P. That sounds good! I"m in 340. Thanks by the way! If it were light outside, I'd be less hesitant to walk over!
Yum! :D
Yay!! Somewhere in the sea of people :P
Can we do you behavioral and me technical? :P
Sweet! What time is good for you?
Yup yup!  That works for me!. Ready? :D
That'd be awesome! When are you free?. 10pm EST perhaps....?
Awesome! We shall talk then! Behavioral or Technical for you?
Okay!!. Talk to you then!
Whoa, I was just about to ask you too!. Do noodles mean ready?. :P
Let's do it!
Let's start 9:15am est so I can make sure I'm super on time! !. Ha, good to know!
Pants are important!. I am in an Uber for 3 more minutes D:
Eep ready! :D. Phone call?
They were tough, but the YouTube video helps a lot!. Ahh, the party at GHC was so good!
Haha, did you like it?. Hooray, I survived American Airlines!. Yes, practice tomorrow would be fantastic!. Mochi!! :D Are you at home?. You got it!! Just know how to find the slope of two lines and come up with business recommendations (like in the video)!
6:15-8pm? :D. That's funny, that's what I had been thinking too!
Wu!
Yes!
I'll be in Rice 340!. No worries if you can't make it though! :O
Okay :D I'll see you soon.
Thank you James!! I will try my best! :D. Interview practice today? :P
When are you free?
Okay! I can do until 7:45pm due to a thingy at 8pm.
James..! I remember you attended Professor Tychonievich's TA class. Did he ever give advice on what to do if members in a group are not contributing equally?
Haha :P. Wow, thanks for checking on this!!. It's a tough case because I'd be worried that the other group members might feel like they were "ratted out."  Not sure if it would be okay to hide the fact that their team member brought the concern to us, or if we just discovered it through Git commits.. Hopefully grade changes will be incentive for the other team members to contribute more.  It's possible that delegation by the concerned team member could go a long way.. Don't worry about crafting any response to this, I think I'm just articulating my thoughts here :P. But.....!! Something came up and I will need to meet at 7pm-7:50pm instead of 6:30pm.. You can be the interviewee the whole time, since yours is tomorrow :D
Awesome, see you then :D
Yes!
Ahh, the name XP. *
Oh Hi! Sorry I got this too late!. On the way already, or?
I hope your interview went well!
Did you have a fun time at capital one though? :D I'll ask you more in person...!. Hi chew!
Any more interviews coming up for you to practice for?
Hehe, it was pretty fun! I'll still be practicing just in case I am fortunate enough for any second rounds!. If you want to, too! Would it still be symbiotic?
I interviewed on Tuesday and they let me know on Monday!. Well, Friday if I hadn't missed their call!
:O!!! Ah, Capital One just confirmed a spot for me in San Francisco if I want!!
:D. Oh man, I am totally down! I am booked til the weekend before Thanksgiving though!. Thank you! ^-^ I hope you get your dreams too!. The remix!
Ooh, for you or I? Yeah, practice is good!. Whoa, you have another? :D Congrats!. Is anytime in the morning good for you?. I am free 9-11:30am!. Hmm.. Or sometime after 1pm might be better! Either way!. *after 1:30pm
Sounds good!!
See ya :D. If Rice 340 is full, I found a little nook on the 2nd floor where Tsully Buttchugs is!. P.s. My boyfriend is here because he's visiting, but he will be quiet like a kangaroo!. And he brought snacks
:D !!!??
Ahhhh! Congrats?!?!
That's so awesome! You've been a big help to me, for sure!. Will you be at your apartment around 5:30pm?

Ahh, did it happen to you? Or just that dog? :P. Wow, so cool!!! :P. P.s. how are you? :D. I'm pretty good too! Ahh, that'd be awesome!!. Are you free Friday by chance? I'm going to HackDuke Saturday/Sunday!. Okay cool! Ttfn :O. Hooray! What time?

Yay!. On the way from the Afc!. Here!. Thank you for the Bok Choy!!
Oh yeah, I'm super good at loading things :D. Ahh, that loaf leg thing your cat does is super cute!!
Hehe, nice dramatic twist there at the end. Still up for DDR? :D Today or tomorrow?

That's great!. Are you going to the Start Up Fair today? :D. Did you find a partner for Mobile?. Oh man, that would be awesome, but I am working with my friend Brian and I wouldn't want him to have to find another partner or anything!. Totoro! :D. Wow, what a coincidence!. cow-in-sea-dense
Woo, sea cow! :D
Fun fact: She does awesome astronomy voice overs
Haha, I've definitely thought that at some point too!
Oh by the way!! Did I tell you I am working with these? : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2STTNYNF4lk
Actually python :D. Oh hey, any ideas on what I should make it do?

Oh man!!. I think he might be too slow for that :P. That would be fun to watch though!. I will try it!. It could work if we have 1 per arrow :P. I bet there has been work on object recognition in ddr!
Haha, guess the artist (You've heard of them before).
Oh that would be awesome!. It's Picasso :O
Yes! Haha, I liked it a lot so I took a picture of it when I visited his museum.

Thank you! Merry Christmas to you too, Brian!
Hehe
Facebook messenger! What about for you?
I'm glad you understand the real dangers in life ;O
My number is 540-250-8732. Yup yup!! Mine is lli5ba
Thanks!
Oh wait, do we have a Pokemon name yet?. Can we be Pikachu?. :P Well, luck of the draw, I guess
Hehehe. I guess we could get started though, because we could just rename our repo? Or should we just wait til Friday?
Hmm, probably wait til we get the device then. I'll have time Friday and this weekend to work (:
Haha, that's a great one!! Thanks for picking it up! My github name is lli5ba
Got it, thanks! Haha, are you in Rice right now by chance?
That's fine :P. Still free at 5pm today?
Cool! Want to meet in Rice or the MEC lounge?
Rice it is!. Should I start checking for a room?. Or maybe Rice 340 or 436 is open!
340 looks open!. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5927109/sort-objects-in-arraylist-by-date. I just found out I am doing something at 5:33pm--Since that would only give us an hour, did you just want to meet Sat/Sunday? Which day works better for you?
Okay neat! Any time preference?
Okay! How is 1pm-3pm?
Cool! I'll meet you in Rice 340 (if it's open!). at 1pm
https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result.html. https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html. Leandra:  Add Item Activity- -The activity should send the info from the fields back as extra data fields in the return intent.  List Activity- -The items in the list should be in order from soonest due date to latest. -Tapping on any item should bring up an Edit Item activity (see that Activity for more info). -Tapping on the checkbox next to an item should flip it's done / not done status.  Brian: Item Info Activity- -The screen should look the same as the Add Item activity, but with the information pre-populated with the information from the item you tapped. -Any changes made here should be reflected back in the original item. -If the due date changes, you should re-sort the the list.. I pushed some stuff! Feel free to ask me any questions about code!
Yup! Just little things to work out like Date format on the main Activity (feel free to do this if you like) and we'll check with OH about the Status Bar being covered up since we spent awhile debugging that already.
Sounds good!
Sweet thanks! Also, I have a favicon we can use!
Haha
Okay cool!
Oh yeah! Forgot to change the status to done. I'll get that tomorrow
Got it! :D I think I can do that by including the boolean in the compareTo function.. Go team!
Yup yup :D
Cool, I just pushed! We just learned about Intents and Services in class.. Found a bug -- if an item is checked and you edit it, then the check status disappears. Could you fix this whenever you get a chance? I think we just need to save the boolean var along with the other variables.
Take your time (: We have until Feb 6th technically
Yup, I built the apk!
Yeah! I think the only open issues are the status bar thing and maybe saving data on rotation (I'll test whether the saveInstanceState thing I added works)
Or is it? dun dun dun. Haha, well we are basically done ^-^
Do you need the mobile devices tomorrow? If not, I will leave them at my housie.
After I push, I think so!!. We just have that pdf to write up!
Yup :D. Hi Brian! I may not be in class today due to homeworks, but I will be finishing up the Android miniapp pdf between 6:30pm and 7:30pm today :D
Definitely! If you have time, just put like, 3 sentences about things you learned in the Readme. I will do the same, and then whoever is last can turn it into a PDF.
You BTN3GJ?
No worries! I am writing my part now!. Do you think we should label each of our comments with our names? I think then they'd be okay with some overlap between us.. Actually, I think I wrote enough for the both of us so you are good! (the words just kept flowing) Maybe you can write the iOS one ;P. App has been fully tested and meets requirements (feel free to check this too). Pushed changes :D Good to go
Not a problem! It wasn't a surprise or anything (:. I mean, I was expecting to work on it, and it didn't take any longer than I expected!
lli5ba!
Nope, what about you? (Sorry, was in class). I'm free Thurs and Fri to do the miniapp!
Neat! When are you free Thursday?
:D
Yup!!. Let's do 7:45pm that way there is a buffer. In Rice 340, probably just til 9pm, but we'll see!
Yup! We're good. Brian!. Quick question: how do I reset the cabinets?. Aka, where is the magnetic wand kept. (for Rice 120)
Yay I got it!! Thank you Brian!!You do dynamic reordering/done I do edit item?. And we adjust if something is harderA victim of lob-sided bowls or Don Norman's critique? That must have been quite the incident :D !. This fall I am taking: -STS with Messeri -Independent Research with Unknown -Machine Learning -Grad Algorithms -Computer Security -One other Grad course (maybe Deep Learning for Graphics) -Either Web and Mobile or a Grad course. And how about yourself?. Oh wait.. I just listed 7 things, I should probably work on that... :P. The first 5 are for certain, so that leaves one or the other!
Hi Sam!! Aw man, I regrettably missed this message, but it was certainly on my mind! 'Til next week, then! :D. Have a good mindfulness class (:. P.s. Sorry for changing the subject! I think that is my approach to awkwardness.. We should totally talk about it more if you are up for it, though!  Do you have any classes before ISA?
Oh, don't worry at all Sam! I don't think it was inconsiderate since you didn't know, and I'd definitely love to keep hanging with you.   Hmm, where will you be around 11:30am-ish?
Oh cool!! :D Think you'll be there until 2pm?. That's awesome! I'm a fan of dual monitors too :D I use the ones in the Mech Lounge since I am technically still a Mech E.. Sweet! I'll come meet you at 11:50ish to hear about it. Okay, good no know :P I'm sure we'll find a place somewhere around Rice's nooks. More like noon...!
Haha :P. Hi Sam! Still up for observatorying?. It starts at 9pm! When is Crypto OH?
Oh good! There is some parking at the Observatory, so I can pick you up wherever you happen to be around 8:45pm
Awesome!  Looking forward to it :D
Are you in Security Lab?. I'm in Rice now too :P
Awesome!. Meet me at Rice 314!. In a couple minutes. Did I miss you somehow?
Oh that's okay, thanks a bunch, I guess I should probably go to you then :P I underestimated my readiness
Thank you so much too :D I had an awesome time at the observatory and working in the lab was great too!. Are you planning on being in the Security Lab anytime between now and 5:30pm?. :P
Ooh, good luck with the GRE studying! Do you have a test day yet? Also.. Japan Club? :O. That sounds awesome!! :D Enjoy the Ramen-ness!
The Facebook event description is super enticing!. My day is going well :D I worked on computer vision and next is machine learning! :P. How about you?
Ooh that would be cool! Where will you be around our usual class time/afterwards? I was planning on using the class time to work on Friday's STS assignment if you want to work together!. Awesome! Are you still planning on getting something from Starbucks? I think I remember your last punch was used last time?. I'll meet you at the Security lab!. At 5pm?
Sounds good!
rm -rf db/ && mkdir db && cp -a empty_db/. db/ && docker stop mysql && docker start mysql
Oh thanks :D Hopefully I will run into Jean while I am there! I'll be in class today, but a summary on Wednesday would be much appreciated !. Hooray!! :D I wonder what it will be like!
Whoa, I was just about to thank you for listening to it!. And also remind you to RSVP!
That sounds fantastic! :P I'll give it a try.. Haha: ":o Sorry I can't answer most questions yet, I can only ask them. I'm getting smarter though, hopefully soon!"
Wow! :O. I'm going to get to sleep, so goodnight for now! :D
You're a fantastic friend too!! :D Yup, at the Sts talk (though I'll be coming in 15 minutes late). See you!. Oh yay!! I'm so glad you finished!! :D We'll work really hard next semester to stay on top of the final thesis!. Oh that's fantastic!. My Saturday has been great, I'm spending time with my mom! What about you?
That sounds great! Yup, don't want to throw off your sleeping schedule! I'm glad you got to talk to your parents. Will you see them for Thanksgiving.. Whoops, forgot the question mark.. That must've been confusing!. Hi Sam! Were you able to add to my fork on Github or do I need to give you special permission?. Happy Thanksgiving, Sam! I hope you have a good time (:. Oh, thank you, Sam. :D I look forward to hearing about your break back in STS class!
Hehe, that's a ton!! It just makes docker-compose even more purposeful ^-^ !. Good luck on Algo! :D. Let's do it. two paragraphs of our Framework paper today :D!
Have a great time :D If you happen to pass by my house afterwards, feel free to stop in for our Christmas party :P. Hmm, I think I need to work on not procrastinating essay writing :P . How did/are your STS papers go(ing)?
Ahh, if it helps, I found a productivity technique that works well for me. I broke the essay up into really small parts, that way it was more approachable. Like this:. Boundary objects, brief description, define social worlds (50 words) More about boundary objects (50 words)  Introduce how boundary object theory can be applied - translation, coherence (50 words) Define different types of boundary objects and give examples (50 words) Give system of systems view of boundary objects, bridge building examples (50 words) Give turing test example? (50 words) Give zoology example (50 words) summary sentence (25 words)
That's for Framework Synthesis!. Then you break up Framework application too.. So 375 + 375 = 750 ^-^. So it's way easier to start when you think of it that way!. Either way, you got this :D. I believe in you!
Sounds good, Sam (: I'm going to Canada tomorrow :O. Thank you for company and dinner on Wednesday! That was a lot of fun! I hope you are having a nice weekend too
It's really good! I've been doing a lot of sports!. I'm thinking about working on STS tomorrow :P How are you and what are you up to?
Wow!! That is so fantastic ^-^ So happy for you!! Also, what a personalized email :D. By the way, which courses are you taking this semester along with Cloud, STS, and TLS?
Oh cool!! Is Black Fire the course you were talking about last semester about the history of UVa? That sounds really cool!. I'm glad you got in, too!
Thank you so much for your company and dinner! I really enjoyed it ^-^. That would not be forward unless you had intentions :P . Otherwise, it sounds like a compliment, so thank you!
I think so too. There are so many other vineyards around CVille too! Wow, I didn't even know he had a winery nearby.
That's a really good idea! I wonder if there was any debate among the committee when they decided on it, or if it is just something they use every year. I'm sure it had to have crossed their minds!. I don't know if calling him mentally ill would be offensive to actual mentally ill people, but he's definitely a narcissist. And it does seem like it is just one bad thing after another so far :( Missing Obama...I'm ready for a new president too! I wonder if there was ever such an opposed president in all of history. Have you done any research on how to actually remove Trump? :O. And thanks (: It's always good to know there is someone to listen. Oh yes, Nixon and Jackson are particularly infamous!. Mmmhm! I definitely want to keep in touch and hear how things are going during your epic Phd journey!. Thank you so much for awesome conversation and company!! (:. And dinner too!!. Hi! Sorry we did not end up meeting up for STS this weekend. Pearl Hacks was pretty much the entire weekend (in fact, we are still on the bus :P). What do you normally do Monday nights? Would you be up for scheduling in an STS session then?Great, thanks for sending it and letting me know! And no worries, it happens :DHi Jamie!  Sure, I live at 526 Valley Road, my phone number is (540)250-8732, and I will be needing a ride.  So far this year, Caitlin has been giving me rides.   Thanks for putting this together! :DOh yes! Did he send you my thoughts too? I can repost here as well so you are on the same page :D
Sure thing! And I haven't attempted to play yet, I just downloaded the zip file.
Nice, I will let you know if I run into any problems. (:. "Hi Matt!  I totally saw it, just haven't yet composed some decently worded thought about it. Thanks for reaching out through this medium, as it feels way easier to respond. tongue emoticon  I thought the idea sounded very awesome, and the fees would be no problem, but I did have some hesitations about the overall time commitment and coordination. I'd also be interested in seeing a link to the Scorpio game that was mentioned.  I feel like the overall mission statements resonated well with me.  Those are some current thoughts...!  Thanks grin emoticon Leandra Likely, I'd be more on the 5-10 hr/week scale (and that's on the optimistic side!). If I really like what I'm working on it'd probably be easy though! What were your thoughts on time?". Then to summarize -> Matt explained the time would be okay, and I was like, cool!
Most likely long-term, unless I get really interested in a certain game (as it can be pretty addicting sometimes)!  I don't intend to be a game designer as a full-time job, and school and a future job will be the main time-spenders, along with my active travelling and extra curricular and whatnot. 5-10 hrs/week is definitely on the optimistic side, as I noted.. I definitely want to be open about this since this is a serious endeavor, and I would not be offended at all if you are looking for people who would commit more time!
It would be very cool! Coding games has been one of my favorite developer activities since the CS Intro course :D . It just would be more on the casual side for me. If it helps, I support the idea of differentiation of pay based on time-spent (in the near/far future of indie game success) so that it would be more fair!. And definitely coding!. By design, do you mean art assets or level/story?. (but still coding either way, just curious) :P
(Well, I guess if I had a game idea, I would prefer to do designs for that particular game, actually!). Along with coding, of course.
P.S. Definitely feel free to share anything I've posted here with Matt!
Off to sleep for me for now :D . As I said to Matt, big kudos for planning all of this! I'm looking forward to see where this goes...!
Night!
Sure thing!  Just as a note, my boyfriend, Peter, who does graphic design, has been helping me with these logos. I'm not sure that this is okay per the company guidelines. Of course, he is sworn to secrecy and is not expecting any compensation, but I haven't made him sign anything official yet. Thoughts?
Okay, cool! Thanks for explaining that.
Yes definitely!. Could you point me to which ones in particular?
Okay! Is Michael alright with potential reformulating of his designs?
Great! I will forward the task to Peter
Good to know!
Hi! I will not be able to make it, unfortunately. Also, I like the idea of a convention and the marketing opportunities, but I feel like we are too early in development to be showing anything(?)
Thanks for the update. I bet there will be other opportunities in the future! Or if not, we will make them :P
I have it! Which channel should I send it though?
I think it can go through Facebook messenger or slack too if you aren't worried about security or anything!. But I will email too!Right right! Sending through email then (:Oh man, that's awesome!!! I hope you enjoyed the concert too!!! :D. Have a safe trip back to Duke?!
I hope you got to catch up on sleep since then :P
I don't know any off the top of my head. Maybe there is a Facebook group with all the incoming new grad full-timers?. I will be returning to Capital One! What about you?
Oh cool!! I will be in San Francisco! And you?
Neato ^-^ . By the way, do you happen to know any details on the start date for orientation?. Oh, what is your start date? :P. It'll probably be similar for SFOh neat! Thanks for the info. I should probably check with my recruiter on that :PThey can if they aren't full all the way
I'm checking mine in because I will have liquids/sharp things on them.. I'll be bringing my backpack as a carryon. With my laptop!
And put some change of clothes in your carry on, and keep anything essential in the carry on in case they lose your luggage
Time to pack :D!. I'll look it up
Oh I'm definitely sleeping. $ 84.23 for the shoes (I'll check if I can do Price rewind) What model of Teva are they?. And do you have the receipt in the bag for the otterbox?. Tanza?
It has really good reviews! It says there is a buckle, so it will be easy to take off for temples
Cool!. Do you happen to have the receipt? The other option is that it is in the car
Okay, thanks for looking!
Don't pack any though, Japanese law requires a special degradable paper
There might be perks to having a student ID in foreign countries.. Sometimes there are "student" discounts. I'm not sure if there are any in Japan
How much cash is it? My mom could deposit it and then transfer it to me, then you or something. That's fine if you don't have your ID
Okay. Wow, my professor wrote a post about people who won't accept things when someone offers you!. offers them something*
""I cannot accept -- that's yours. You earned it, I did not. I do not deserve it." This is a very common refrain. It's also largely irrelevant: we live in a world in which bad things manifestly happen to good people; we do not all get what we deserve in the material world". ""I will not accept; I would rather you have it." This one often comes up first or second -- regardless, it's quite common. It also, when you think it through, implies that the giver is making a mistake. ". To summarize some parts from the super long essay he has written. "This is where we reach the issue of pride. I posit that if you dig into the issue, the key motivation behind the refusal of gifts/charity is pride. This can manifest both directly and indirectly.   The indirect approach, which is less often considered, is implicit in the reasoning "I believe you are making a mistake in giving that to me." The recipient has to believe "I know more about my situation and about the giver's situation than the giver does, and thus I can tell that it is a mistake." ". "The most common instance of this is when another adult tries to make a gift and you believe the giver "cannot afford it". ". My input would be that often I notice people don't accept gifts because they believe the giver does not really want to give them something, but are just doing it out of courtesy. Is this the reason you're familiar with?
What is a reason that you have not accepted a gift in the past? If you have an example?. Trying to think of some input to add in the discussion.
That's an alternate interesting situation. Do you often accept gifts/favors when people offer you them?
Is it because his argument is just so convincing? :P. I have definitely done this in the past, like that time when your grandfather offered me money for helping in the lawn.
I've learned my lesson since then.. It makes sense to me that my reason for declining was pride.

I like the quote by Gerson!. On your phone: Install Here maps and download the maps for Japan. Also download Hyperdia time tables
Yes
You keep them with you on the go and leave your actual passport in the airbnb room.. You need them for id purposes. Also, when traveling, pack one in your check bag, and one in your carry on, just in case you lose your passport
Really you should also keep a scan of your passport on the cloud too. (I have one in an email attachment that I always use). If you keep a picture of your passport on your phone, and send it to yourself through email too, that should suffice as an ID as long as you have your phone on you at all times
Go into the map, Click the Menu, and press "Download maps"
Yeah, you're right.. Try Navitime Japan Travel. I'm also getting "Tokyo Offline Map Guide". Do you have an extra charging cable that looks like this.... http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bbdkgDUhL._SY300_.jpg. Oh, I found one!!
Want me to pack a swiss army knife for you?. We're signed up for one checked bag each, and you are also allowed one carry on, and one "personal item". I am bringing the camping bag, my backpack, and a string backpack (for when in the plane seat). They are like nesting dolls
I'm bringing my Amira backpack because it is a lot more comfortable.
It seems like there is lots of room in my bag-- same for you?. Well not a lot, a lot... but I think a comfy backpack will be very important!
I can hook you up with my razor (and new cartridge) as a last resort.. By the way, the sunscreen/bugspray combo is a bit heavy--would you mind carrying one or the other in your bag?. /aloe vera
Thanks!. How much space is on your laptop after all?. Also, no need to bring anti-bacterial ointment--I packed some!. I also packed a minimal amount of bandaids (about 10, and different varieties). Could you be ready by 6:20am?. Or 6:15pm. The flight got cancelled, so we need to leave from Greensboro instead. departure 10:35am. ???. !!!. Rawr!!!. About to come over there and try and wake you up in a bit.... sklfjlkdsfj. *facebooknoise*. Whoa, did it work?. jwlkjr1!!!. !!!. !!!. !!!. !!!. !!. !!!!!!!.

Oh good!!. You're awake. Can you be ready by 6:30?
Testing. Oh whoops, you can't text me because the pocket WiFi is here. Attack!. Get off at the next stop! (Nakano)
Hehe
Give advice that will help other travellers! Like it was super modern and clean and very close to the JR station, so convenient for making day trips to Nara, Osaka, etc. Also, close to 7-Eleven,  and also close to the bus stops which we used to see temples in Kyoto. Could also mention the awesome Conveyer belt sushi place off near Nijo station and Flet's 100 yen store.. And of course that it was very easy to find and give our time estimate on how long it took to walk from the station. Lots of guidance given from Yoshi
Hi Peter!. Thanks
Awake for talking when?. I'm not busy!
Oh! How was your day?
Neat! How was that?
It was really good! Spent time with my mom!. And finished a couple errands.
My mom says the mowing at our house was better than usual!. (Because of Katy?)
Oh what do you mean by more?
Oh neat!
And yup! I'm making little gift bags with the treats I brought back!
I'll see how many I can make and then decide who to give them all to. Definitely Twe, Leyla, Albany... and then more people!
Yes, they will! I'll need to label the individual ones though
Oh that would be fun!. I'm not sure which bags to use. Right now they are in plastic bags
I could label the unlabeled treats by taping them to hard paper and then writing on the hard paper
Hehe, I might get some little plain baggies for doller tree if I can't find any. Dollar!*
Oh yeah! I've those before. I might just include a crane instead
No :P I just need 10!. I'll start tonight!
Oh cool!! (:. What time to meet in the morning!. ?. You can come over!. And bring some of your Gameboy games. And so I can download all the pictures you took!
I'll just watch you play
Whoops, you just think it's silly because I forgot the exclamation point!. Will you come at 9am?
Any size! I think smaller us nice. Is*
Still awake?
What are you doing?
Folding cranes :P

I'm glad it worked out. Trying to read articles to understand "retro game collecting" better.. Still don't understand... http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-12-crippled-by-nostalgia-the-fraud-of-retro-gaming. http://www.nintendolife.com/forums/retro/things_i_dont_understand_about_game_collectors. https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2zguri/i_dont_understand_the_appeal_of_retro_video_games/. Need enlightenment... http://wfae.org/post/retro-video-games-link-past. http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/09/30/golden-oldies-retro-video-game-fans-flock-tokyo.html
That all sounds good, but I want to understand your passion for it, and why you ultimately chose it as a hobby over other ones!. No need to defend yourself, as I am not trying to pick on you by sending the articles. Just trying to show how few articles I was able to find on the subject. Maybe you can direct me to some better ones that you relate to?
I didn't know that!. Sounds like the abridged version!
Also super vague
I remember these times. I didn't realize it was so recent nor the beginning of a saga. I still am not much closer to understanding the importance of the hobby to you. Why would you choose collecting retro games over something else that you did with your friends before they left if you owe it all to those moments.. ?*
I mean why would you pick finding video games as a hobby, or way to spend time, instead of something else? What makes you continue to be passionate about it and want to grow and progress at it?
You mean video games are not really your passion then, since you won't be continuing? What made it your passion of 3+ years then?
Like, what do you like so much about it? I've heard the backstory, but backstories don't explain a continued love for something, much as the way two people met does not encompass their entire relationship
Hobbies are all rewarding as you progress in them, though. So that cannot explain it either.
You enjoy collecting things then?
Yes, that's fine.. Tell me earlier next time, if you can!. What time should I expect you?
Okay.. Is it alright if we talk about our relationship today. I feel like it's still not going well.. ?*. Also coming at 9:45 is okay! I've started something, so that time would be better than earlier. Let me know when you are leaving, also don't forget the kit kats and photos!
Wow, that's a very long time!. I hope your vacation is going very well!. If you happen to be at a flea market anyway... Could you look out for this game? Shepherd's Crossing on Nintendo DS. It is not for sale on the internet.. Or the PS2 version for less than $5. Wait, no... I hear it's too addictive!. :P. The hard drive file format (Mac) is not compatible with my computer, so I'll hold off on getting the pictures. If you're able to transfer a lot of the images to Google Drive, that would work well! Or we can do it another time. I'll leave the hard drive in my house. But yup, can definitely do without the video game!!
Oh, it's okay! (: I've decided it will be okay!
Haha :P
Aw ^-^
I love you too!!. How was your day?
Oh, don't worry about that!! I have other addicting games already :P. Good night to you!
Good :d
Oh I know!!. I completed 5 minutes!!. Your move!. Just kidding, it's self improvement, not a competition.. Unless competing motivates you more :P
:3
Do you have wifi?
I do!. Is it possible to chat and play? (fb call?). Or are you in a non-quiet place?
I knew it!. hehe :P. Bloons is okay?
Thank you so much for adding all the photos!
Whoa!! Like, the fox photos?
Hmm, would you mind sending another request?
Aww, I love you so much!
That's what I really wanted to say instead of "Well Done!"
Oh yay!!!. I'll be there in a minute!
I'm ready!
You are so cute and awesome to be with!
I miss seeing you all the time!
Monkey sub for the win!. :3. Good game!
One more ;)
So ready!
Yes :P. Thank you!!
Wow, nice aircraft lander!. So sleepy
Close
In love you-!!
Sleeping I must!. I think
Whoops, I fell asleep :P. Sweet dreams!!!
Wow, I was so asleep.. I missed all the puppy dog faces!. Thank you for spending time with me too! It was a lot of fun!. Going for 15 minutes of exercise today :P. 15 minutes of exercise down :3. !
Wow, thank you so much!!. What are you doing today?. New home for the summer :D
And I have the whole basement :P. Oh, you're fine!. I take it you had lots of fun?
It's a cool basement! And this way, I can do jumping!
Yeah! The common area part, but no one really uses it
Exactly!!
I'm sorry you did not have fun :(
Oh good!! I'll unpack a bit!. While you tell me more about how your vacation is going!
No way, really?. Compared to Japan?
I'm glad you liked Japan!!. Dark Alliance?. French Toast is really awesome too!
That sounds like awesomeness!!
Nice!!. We can play sometime if it is good!. Hehe, are they tiny deer?. Deer friends!
^-^ Count me in!
Room so big. ... So much space!
I wouldn't even have to sneak them!
Just for the day!
I am acquainted !. I fear I don't have fancy enough clothes for tomorrow!. We will see
:P. We can go thrifting!. Good clothes to be found!
Yay!!. They might close by the time you arrive though :P
Hehe, I have work
Thank you!. :3. I am so sleepy :3. What are you up to now?
Oh, what's for dinner?. And oh no!. Would you want to play bloons before I go to sleep?
Yum yum!!
Awesome!!
Be there soon! I'm finishing up talking to my mum!
Ready!
Yes please! ^~^. Thanks for waiting!. That Round 22, huh?. Good game!! (:. Sweet dreams to you, my love ^-^
I love you too :3
Yes, but I am falling asleep, so how about a rematch tomorrow night? :P
Sleep tight, Peter!
Whoa, so cool!. ^-^. Bye!
What are the plans for today?. Good morning!! (:
Oh yay!! It's you!. Wow, no plans?! :O. I am doing 30 minutes of exercise today!. ^-^. Do you think you will be applying for any jobs this summer?
That's awesome! What date do you think you will start applying?. Or just like How soon?
That's really fantastic!. I could help you add some places to the list. Just let me know which type of job you are seeking. (illustrator? game graphic designer? web design?
Don't think so much based on skills! It's what you are most passionate about and the rest will follow!. I didn't think you were so interested in web design though?
Is Turner Broadcasting a category other than illustration, game design or graphic design?
Oh okay!. ^-^. Woo, 30 minutes down~~!
Aww, really? (:
I'll color you lots of emotions ^-^. How about excited orange?. Or is it exciting orange?
Whoa :P. I hope your day is the nicest (:
I'll find something! :3 Thank you though!
Aww ^-^. We could do a weekend together sometime!. For now, I'll go get ready for my first day!
Maybe you could even plan it ;)
Cool!
I was thinking more along the lines of a fun weekend though!. Or like... romantic or something!
Anyway, have a great day!
Just ask me when you choose a weekend!. I'm not free this weekend because my mum is visiting!
I love you!!
screenshot ;P. But you can just have me instead!
:3
Yup!!
^-^. Want to play?. Oh!! What did you do today?
I want to cuddle with you :3
Okay!. Wait wait.. I asked you a thing. What did you do today?
Oh, I like your website!!. You are really great, Peter!!
*cuddles pillow*
*still cuddling pillow*
*cuddling Peter from far away*
Whoops, I totally fell asleep :P. I love you too!!. I'll go get ready for sleep :P
just until it's time to wake up!
You're super fantastic!!. What are you up to now?
Oh wow!!. I thought you just never sleep :P
What is the plan for tomorrow?. I love you!!
What's your opinion of that?
That's not an opinion :P That's a politicians answer.. 's*
Okay, what's your plan for tomorrow then? :D
I can't wait to see it ^-^ Let me know when it's live!
What sorts of things are open for consideration?. An animation?. What are you making?
Make an animation! :P
A story!. Bear N Bear?
Okay!. https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/drive/1AX5rtEJDPs. I'll let you get back to sleep!. Sweet dreams to you (:
Thank you!!! I hope it's not too difficult through Google Drive.. When are you going to the water park?
Definitely!
Friday!
Okay!. I'm doing my 30 minutes of exercise now ;3
By the way, how long do you sleep?
That sounds good! I've been sleeping too much :P
Whoa o.o !
It depends what my manager says today! The water park has a "Twilight pass" from 5pm to close, but the outdoor park closes by 7pm, so it would be great if I could be there by 5pm. I could definitely meet you guys at the water park at 6:30pm, since I would just have to leave work at 4pm.. I could get permission to leave at 3pm if I just go to work early though!
5:30pm would be a cool time!! That way you guys could be there longer for the outdoor part!. (if it's not raining)
Sweet!. I'll let you know when I know, then!
(when I'll be there!). That's awesome!. Tell him thank you ^-^
Actually, if you don't have to buy it ahead of time, don't. I'm always worried about car trouble!. And nah, just do you creative project! Save your enthusiasm for when we go together!
Okay, awesome!
I know he gets a military discount though, so we'll see.
No, that's fine! If you want to though, I'd be happy to try it on, but there's a good chance you might have to return it.. Up to you though!. I'll already be wearing something for the water park when I get there!. Should I wear a one piece or the brown and blue one?
I have the black one if that's fine!
Oh yeah, how did that go?
Thank you for that ^-^. Okay, 15 minutes of exercise is okay today ^-^
I'll do it!
If you can find one just like mine (low v-neck, thin fabric, buttons, that would be neat!. Really, don't worry though!. Women's sizes are unreliable :P. I'm going to go get ready and go to work early!. Have an awesome day!
I love you!!. May I stay with you Friday night?. / is there extra parking?
Is there enough room? Could I stay in your room?. I'm fine anywhere though! Just want to avoid driving back at night. And seeing you longer is a plus!
Okay, great!
Really? Is that okay?
I choose you!
Likely 6pm! But I'll try for earlier
How is your day going so far? (:
It's good! May I call you and learn more?
Oh good!! I'll call in about 5 minites
Yes!. Planning on calling still?
Okay!. 10 minutes  of exercise today!
I'll be there by 5:30pm!
Perhaps even 5:10pm!
I will!. Just leaving work early. Not hijacking a plane or anything
Well 5:30 is most likely!
Oh, that is too bad! I must've missed that when I checked the calendar.. Any other plans for today or should I just stick around here (. ?*
Yup yup!
Oh, which pool?
Okay, what's the plan, then? :3
What does that mean?. I need direction!. Go, or nah?. Was planning on leaving now
Sounds so negative though!
So you don't want me to go?
No
Send me your address. Just send a location pin
Be there at 6pm!
;). I love you very much!!. Sweet dreams!
You won't miss my Good morning!! (:
Status unknown!. How are yours?
Hooray!
It was really yummy! We just ate in the hotel, and now we're hanging out at the hotel. How was the trip back for you?
Oh!! How is she?
Wow, that's nice :D. I bet she was glad to see everyone!. Gang's all here...
Oh wow!! Did she eat?
That's good! What sort of food was it?
Oh yeah, she does like Chinese food :P
What's the plan for today?
Whoa, so you're at church right now?. How is it?
Is it good?. :3
That's interesting!. Does he say to get help?
Thank you for the update1. Did they talk about the shooting in Orlando?
Maybe someone will bring it up!
Aw. That's okay, there a lots of things in the world.
Hugs for Peter!. :3

Oh, you're right!. I'm technically in Vienna

Would you ever consider doing a horseback camping trip?
:D!. It would be so much fun.. I'm going to take some horseback riding lessons this summer and learn how to jump and whatnot. It think it will take at least a year though if I am doing it right!
It is. I'll see how it goes!
There is a riding club at UVA!
Yeah!. The pricing may not be worth it though! It's $1,600 a semester
No, that's just for the stable and horse fees.. It's $150 for the club!. I'll look at horse costs and see if it is a worthwhile price.. You get unlimited rides and 2 lessons a week. How is Holly's horse?
Aw, poor horse
I'm not sick!. I think :P. I was worried when your brother said he had strep throat. How are you?
Oh good!
Didja get the google drive spiffied up?
Thank you bunches! I will put my phone photos into an album for you too!. And gopro. Wup wup wup ^-^
Wow, thank you so so so so so so much that should be fine.. Thank you!
*hugs*
^-^ Sweet dreams, Peter!!
It's cute!. I love you too!!. Thank you ^-^
Good morning! :3
I love you too!! (:
Haha :P
Panda at the ready!
I'm glad you like it (:
Hello, Cutie! (:
How is your day going?
I can help you with the shelf!. I'm good with disassembling things :D. What a neat day!
I can give any opinions on the website :3. How is the job hunt?. I've been doing some job searching myself!
Need a second look?. Sometimes new graduates can be interns. But make sure you aren't "unpaid" :P
Well I bet there's a job for you somewhere out there ^-^ !!!
And if you aren't sure about Turner Broadcasting, then just go ahead and apply anyway!
Just in general, take a look on glassdoor.com-- they list benefits, employee reviews and what not!. They might even have some comprehensive guide to best _____ companies.. Their "best tech company" guide was pretty helpful for me!. I can't remember if glassdoor.com is free or not, but you can get a week long trial at least and use it while it lasts!
Good luck ^-^. If it would help you, I can skype with you as you look in case you want someone to listen
Okay!
Haha, don't worry about hurting my feelings :P
Alrighty!. What is your week looking like?
Whoa, is your house going through some work?. That's exciting!
Ah, I see!
Isn't it cool how much time there is everyday?. So much possibility :D
Dun dun dun!
It's so much time for activities (:
What would you do today if you had more time?
Do a little of both each day :3. That way neither is being too neglected!
I like East of Eden very much.. The book is really beautiful to ready but Steinbeck doesn't even have to use complex words to make it that way.
The craziest book I've ever read.. But I don't read enough anyway.. There are so many different types of characters in the story.
Not all dynamic.. Some static, some dynamic.. But there is a large range of characters.. Evil or good, or maybe just human.
I finished! It's good!. I hope you've had a great day too :D. I'm glad I make you happy ^-^ What is it that makes you happy?. Just a friend?
The book!
No, I was just rediscovering it :P
I'm not even sure what it means.. Sweet dreams to you :3. I love you ^-^
Do you know?
"just a friend"?
Oh, I meant, why do I make you happy? Is it just nice having a friend?. I wonder if I am any good at being a friend.
I want to be romantic with you.. Sweet dreams :3
You have my address? When checking for events, anything in a 1 hour radius (or more ) is fair game! There's more going on in Washington DC than Vienna, I suspecy!
Good morning!
There is one in Virginia too!. Maybe Maryland is closer though. Lots of stuff to do in DC too!
I haven't yet!
Good day today?
Yes, good day!! (:. Wait, is out with your dad good or bad? :P
Oh good!
Hehe, aw, well thanks!. I'm thrilled to receive it any time of the day!
What did you do today?. Like when you went out with your dad?
Oh neat! Sounds like you learned the mysteries of the recycle center and got to spend time with family and do fun tile moving!
Thanks!. Sleep time :3
Aww ^-^
Hum, why do I always want you when I'm not with you?
That sounds totally illocigal. :P. Yes, I always like to see you :3
I've said too much
Oh, don't be sad, and don't jump to conclusions.. Just expressing my strong physical attraction to you when you aren't here.
Maybe not.
I can't wait to do a trial run.
Wow, I sound so cryptic. Just don't feel comfortable saying everything through facebook!. How do I even know this is you?
Haha, so not what I meant :P
chatcrypt.com. Room: SuperSecret password: blobs
Gone forever?
I love you so so much!
Sweet dreams :3
Oh whoops, one too many foxes cuddling
:P hehe
^^. Sweet dreams, Peter!!
Practicing telling my fantasizes to an empty chat room :P
It's super embarrassing, not sure if I'm ready!. I love you <3. ^-^ Sweet dreams for real this time!
:$. Whoops, clicked that 4 too many times. Haha. OH no. :P. Sweet dreams, cutie!!
Good morning! (:
I hope you are having a super fantastic day!. When is Hershey Park week again?
Thanks! I will put that on my calendar this time!
On the weekend of 23-24th I could!
It's definitely July.
I heard from your dad!
Aw, thanks (:
What things did you do today? :D
Whoa, circuitboard parts or just plastic pieces?. Cody could have mine if he wants!. I have a bunch of extras too
Whoops, they were the same in my head for a second :P
Hopefully that is forgivable.
*gasp*. When will I see you again?
Anytime is fine, just let me know!
Do you ever watch those political videos on Facebook about gun rights and suh?. such*
The one that features my favorite president?. (Obama). https://www.facebook.com/newshour/videos/10154247237078675/. It's a good one!. Obama's cool !. Yup... anyway
Sure does!. I can't tell if this video is actually supposed to highlight "Trump's best moments". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RYVEIbwiOE. Only 4 minutes in!. Was trying to look at him from the "other perspective". Now I just need to tackle watching Hillary and Bernie.. Crazy how little I know about any of them!
Nah, I went until 10. Oh, a handy google feature let's you search "Donald Trump on the issues" and brings up their whole platform based on quotes by them!. Donald Trump's is really lacking in solid info though :P
hehe, the ambiguity. vs Sanders:. My view is simple: health care is a right, not a privilege. We spend far more than any other country on health care, but 29 million Americans remain uninsured and millions more are under-insured. That is unacceptable. The time has come for a Medicare-for-all universal health care system that provides every American with affordable, quality care.. Hillary is good too!. I've fought for quality, affordable health care my entire career. As president, I'll defend the Affordable Care Act, build on its successes, and go even further to reduce costs. My plan will crack down on drug companies charging excessive prices, slow the growth of out-of-pocket costs, and provide a new credit to those facing high health expenses.. Apologies if you are actually looking at the source right now
This google platform search is really amazing!. I think behind the scenes it's doing text mining to find and categorize relevant quotes, and it is super accurate!. ^-^. Thanks for helping me be more politically informed, Google.... Sorry, too many thoughts :P. I'm done!
Hmmm..
Too radical for these capitalists
Sounds bitter.... You don't know what they can or can't have.... Hard to tell your tone just through messenger though!. Maybe it was sarcasm?. Set me straight, doctor!
Does that mean they can have that?. ^-^
I'm headed to sleep now! Want to join me?
Oh good! (:
hehe :P. Won't be long til I see you again ^-^. (I keep telling myself)
Just a week or so?
Hoping, or knowing?. *Hope so, or know so
The world cannot know... *dramatic scene in movie?*. Sweet dreams to you :D
I'll do the same!. Good morning!. Did you still want to be workout buddies? If you did, I was hoping you could keep me accountable when I don't check in on a workout :P I can do the same for you if you like!. http://www.macworld.com/article/2154840/these-four-apps-turn-your-phone-into-your-workout-buddy.html There's always these.. :P. But I'd rather have you
Aw thanks!! Not yet :P
Did you exercise today?
Would you like accountability updates too?
Speaking of being held accountable.... :P. Interview studying is more important though!. Gotta get that cool tech job!. This job is really cool
No, but it's good right now!
The office snacks!. Dried mango tastes so good ^-^ I will save you a bag
It must be experienced :D
He has teeth on mine!
I am (:
Haha :P. I'm going to go drive home now! Workout.. eat dinner :3
Thank you (: Did you workout? :P
Good job!!
By the way, do you remember any details about the bike that was on our porch?. Or would you be able to find the same one online?
The former and my mum needs details to report it
Huffy!
Not mine
The one I pumped up
It was my mom's
Oh yeah, I think that's it!
That's a 24" though for Boys. It was definitely Next!
Oh, maybe it wasn't Next :P. http://www.walmart.com/ip/26-Hyper-Havoc-MTB-Men-s-Bike-Black/16531397?action=product_interest&action_type=title&placement_id=irs_top&strategy=PWVUB&visitor_id=76000011418&category=0:4171:133073:1085617&client_guid=79ece610-a492-4b2f-baa3-57aa3eda4ab0&config_id=2&parent_item_id=21616164&guid=683f6079-92db-4914-8428-e320a1c5abb3&bucket_id=irsbucketdefault&findingMethod=p13n&u1=ipiy1j4j1k00fe150009i&oid=437728.1&wmlspartner=je6NUbpObpQ&sourceid=06519536813732423529&affillinktype=10&veh=aff. How about Hyper?. All the fonts look the same :P
I thought it was grey when I told my mom :P
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdCZDGcE71g. Totally it!
:P. There's a cool app for habit tracking called 7 weeks!
You only need it for 7 weeks to form a habit
Just booked airbnb for October at the Grace Hopper Convention!. Now to book the flight :P
https://computer-engineer-barbie.herokuapp.com/. This is so awesome. This one is awesome.... https://computer-engineer-barbie.herokuapp.com/view/193. :P Whoops, too much usage of awesome
Hmm?. Ohh, the "flag"?. hehe
Hmm, why then?
Oh, they are all user created. Did you read them? Some of them particularly address this issue?. issue.*
Hum?. The home screen?
What what?. Repost?
Which link are you talking about?
That's the home page :P
C'mon, they are all user-submitted. I don't like all of them, but the idea is great and most of them are pretty good!
What about the home page? It changes as more submissions are recieved
Oh, you don't like the design? :P. It's pretty standard rapid-dev web app.
Which one?. Ah, jk that's not the point.. I was just trying to show how I thought the idea was cool and I liked a lot of the submissions!. https://caseyfiesler.com/2014/11/18/barbie-remixed-i-really-can-be-a-computer-engineer/. These ones are all polished, if you want to see a better example :D. Also, it probably doesn't come across as well if you're not familiar with the original barbie book.. I just was confused because I couldn't find any curse words on the page.
Oh :P My professors use that word though, and I wouldn't say it makes me uncomfortable.. I just don't use it myself.. Hardly noticed it
Oh, if you read through the submissions, I doubt young kids are looking at this. Except this one.. https://computer-engineer-barbie.herokuapp.com/view/89805. And they've heard worse anyway. Or they should have if they haven't been heavily shielded from society.
hehe, "terric". If you have a complaint, she has listed her contact info!
Ah, I think that was just a strong statement in outrage against the first book, which seemed to insist that she couldn't do coding on her own, aka being "dependent" on boys. The opposite is just "independent.". The remix link I sent you is more politically correct and highlights the importance of working as a team.
Didn't you think a few of them were funny? :P
https://computer-engineer-barbie.herokuapp.com/view/100. A fine example.... https://computer-engineer-barbie.herokuapp.com/view/158. hehe
Whoops, in all the excitement.. I didn't workout or eat dinner :P
Oh, definitely!
Nah, I have food, I am just doing so much computer chatting :P
No, I like you!
Okay, I'll do that now, and then sleeping :D
Om nom nom. Should I join my friend's indie game studio?
Didn't you read that barbie remix?. Games need all kinds of people!. But it wouldn't be a full time job by any means since there is no pay.. I would just do it for fun on the side.
Hmm, it sounds very cool! And I'm not overly concerned with giving up my "sole rights" to games since I'll know people on the team.. I definitely don't predict I will commit much though, so I might be a disadvantage to the team!. We also need a way better name than GameSmith Studios. The guy's dad is a laywer...! (just noticed that part of the email). lawyer*
"The aim of the company overall is to create interesting, novel games with the limited resources of a small studio -- we focus more on story and interesting mechanics, rather than pretty graphics. The markets we'll be targeting are both PC and mobile games. On mobile, however, I would like to steer towards keeping deep and interesting games alive on a platform plagued by shallow, Skinner Box-y gameplay. ". Not uh oh--should be Yay because the boy has good intentions?
What is there to sign away besides my rights to a game?. And potential liability.
But there is less than if I released a game under my name.. The company.. Just as Capital One holds right to work I do for them!. Same with any company, really.
Not necessarily.. Unless that is in the contract!. But since it is small, we are able to.. Capital One definitely couldn't credit every person who worked on their mobile app.
Oh true. I suppose games and movies both have more credits tied into them than banking websites.. Oh, I should sleep!!
Oh, that's a good question!
Om nom nom yes
Oh! Need to schedule your appointment...!
No, still awake :3. Can't catch me!
Aw :P. hehe. I love you so much, Peter!!!. Dying to see you!!. :3
Still having super attractive feelings toward you.
Oh is it?
It is when you're not here!
P.S, no overnight guests here, so if you do come it'd have to be a hotel most likely! We could travel to other places too!. Definitely doing a New York City trip!. Did you say you were interested in that?
No, probably 4th of July weekend!. (but I'd better book this weekend if so)
Haha, I was in DC for the Fourth of July!. Last year
Please check these out when you get the time! It's a lot to look through.. https://www.airbnb.com/s/New-York-City--NY--United-States?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F05%2F2016&guests=2&room_types%5B%5D=Private+room&price_max=138&zoom=11&search_by_map=true&sw_lat=40.68151957364476&sw_lng=-74.02562606233448&ne_lat=40.88456228290895&ne_lng=-73.71251571077198&ss_id=r9ku33vg&s_tag=SyxnUYBp. Sweet dreams :3
Thank you!
Good morning! Have a super fantastic day!! What did you do yesterday?
That sounds really cool! Are you interested in electronics projects?
Is lack of soldering iron holding you back?
When are you free for a
Your appointment..!
Solar charger!!
Yeah!!
I didn't make it :P
^-^
How is the job searching going? Latest candidates for you? Want me to hold you accountable on that too?
Do the job search! #1 priority?. What is your time goal for applying somewhere?
I might do some job searching today since I don't have any plans. I'll compile a list and start applying later this week.. Remember this?. At the beginning of last week?. :P hehe, sorry, this isn't helping, isit?. Probably pick where to apply before doing your website. Seems like the website could be a blocker. But whatever works for you sounds good :D. Hehe, then I'll pull up your quote from today and show it to you 2 weeks later
And you'll be like: "Yeah, I already have an interview!". Just thought it would help you to know the job description before you makeover your website!
Will you add your newer projects?. Like the packaging and everything else? :D
Yay!
Definitely
Hyper!. Or next
May I call you in a bit?
Cool!
I haven't, but it might be late for you!
Still awake?. Sweet dreams (:. Have a great day today!. Up so early for golf course with your dad?
How was your day today? (:
It was very good!! What did you do?
Oh nice! How was the festival?
Yum ^-^ Any notable foods?
Whoa, revolutionary!!?!. Salad segregation is no more.
Wow, that sounds really fantastic!
Yes, cat treats :D
Sweet potatoes are very good :D. ;D. ;P. :P
:D. This one has teeth!
Good question...!. I'm going to church tomorrow so I'd better get some sleep!
Really really!
Oh, you too! I nearly forgot!
I will now!. Any plans for Father's day?
Oh, where is he leaving to?
Oh wow! His class is on Sunday and Father's Day?  Bad scheduling :P. I'd better get to sleep now! Sweet dreams!
Oh, I see. I thought he might at least stay for the potluck!  (:. I love you too!!
An intern friend invited me!
Thank you! How is your day going?
Oh neat!! Did you end up going to the potluck then?. My day is going really well!
Are you somewhere where we could talk over the phone instead of typing?
Okay!. I'm going to call :D
http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/conversation/conversation-flow. Whoa, I noticed the author has a "Body Language" guide too, so I am reading that now.. Seems less believable though, based on my experience with body language. But the subject has been pretty heavily studied.
With your voice, you mean?. Okay, they might have something with the "discomfort" signals... What did you think of the conversational guide?. The Deli Metaphor really stuck with me even 1-2 years later, so I thought it might be some use to you!
I know just the metaphor to include in my next article then...!
Haha :P Then on page 4 you find out it is just a metaphor...
Wow, there is also a section about "Supporting" others! I definitely need help in that department!
It seemed pretty helpful to read! I was familiar with some of the topics from past research, but it was nice to get a refresher and to remember to practice applying the tips!. What's for dinner today?
Salmon for the win!
Rawr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. (Translation: I miss you!)
Aw, thank you!. (:
When is said salmon being made?
Oh, I got the pun :P. Just wondering if I should expect salmon!
^-^ That sounds wonderful!!. Wow, will I really see you soon?. Are you sure you'd want to miss your family reunion?
Is there anyone at your family reunion who you don't see often?
Oh, why is that?
Cute guy!
I'll make myself available if that's the case!
It's so good!!!!!!
From the Korean family I am staying with!
With your charm (:. And your jokes and cuddles!. It's sweet potato cake!
^-^ And I provide cuddles and fluffyness!
The family I am staying with is so so nice!
Didja read the conversation guide?
Oh! What are you guys doing?. Balder's Gate is my initial guess!
Just a guess!. Which movie?
Oh, I've never heard of that one!
There are a lot of Goosebumps, arent' there?. Did you plan to watch it, or was it just what was on?
Oooh, tradition?. What did you think of it?
Oh, is it the mac adaptor?. We use those at school often!
That's great!
Now you can do all sorts of bigger-screen activities!. Sweet dreams to you!
I'd love to watch you draw!!. :3. I keep thinking about you.
Aw (:. I wish you were here to warm up my bed :3
That will do!
I want more than that.. But that is a nice start ^-^
Sorry! Just having those feelings again. I feel like it happens way too often.
I would love to!
Define professional...
That sounds too professional.. :P. Professional sleeping?
And I would love you talk with you on a super secret message board :P
But probably maybe tomorrow night, if you still want to!. I am going to apply for a thingy, and then sleep :3
Ahh, I want you so badly right now... I'm sorry again. Something I should keep to myself?
Are you sure?
^-^ Okay, I'm glad it's alright with you!. That's a relief. Otherwise I would definitely have some explaining to do.
You're cute! (:
I think we will find lots of things to do, so we won't need the PS2!. Though playing Battlefront has been fun!!
I'll think about it!
Have I shown you these already?
Good question!. This is what young Leandra was up to in 7th or 8th grade
The first one is supposedly some sort of plasma
Hmm, sleep?
Circa 2011
Didn't you take this one? Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too! (:
Early is good!. I was just finishing my application
I can't remember,  did you want job application & workout reminders or just job?
I love you!!. How are you doing?
I'm good! I was gifted a sweet potato cake leftover from the reception last night, and I am on a two day workout streak! Right now I am catching up on work!
If it's anything like the one pictured last night, It will be really good! I'll save it for when you come over!
I'd rather share it. What are you up to today?
Oregan trail life!. Oregon*. You've gotta stick together...!
More Balder's gate?
Sounds like a fun day! What adventures await you next?
It's important if you did it!
What's happening first thing in the morning?
Oh! What do you need to get done though?
Anything could be a lot depending on how much effort you put into it!
I hope it goes well! ^-^ You should start with the easiest one first?. That way you have a shorter todo list quickly?
That's a good point!. In order of priority, then?
Want to super secret chat tonight?. :3
That's great! I'll send you the invite in around 15 minutes!
Oh that's fine! I'm just getting to sleep.. We can totally talk some other time.. Sweet dreams to you (:
I'll wait for a bit then :3
https://chatstep.com. SuperSecret. blobs
You are so incredible :3
I love you!!
Looking forward to seeing you (:
Also, it's not too late to still decide to go to your family reunion..! I don't want you to feel like you missed anything!
Okay!! (:. I'll keep my calendar open!. Sleep tight, you (:
*swoon*. :3. Cutie!!
Sweet dreams, Peter!! ^-^
You have a great day too!. Bye!
I love you!. The life of a cat! :P
Oh that's good!! ^-^
How are you doing?
I mean, what are you up to?
What's the big adventure for today?
Neat! I hope you have a fun time.
Those farming simulators, though.
So what's the punishment?
That's a punishment for me too, but I guess you choose your own punishment!. Don't worry, we can always meet up another weekend if you need to catch up on tasks!
I guess that sounds reasonable!. Do you think it would be motivating at all? Or just depressing?. Doesn't your sister need to look for jobs to?. You guys could bond together doing that!. Or workout together, or something!. jobs too*
Hey, there are definitely workout modifications she could do if she wanted!. She could be the next Transformation Tuesday :P
http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2013/11/05/transformation-tuesday-how-popster-sarah-gained-confidence/. Inspirations!. http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2014/03/19/amazing-transformation-inspirations/. Whoa, go blogilates!. Actually, go people who work that hard! O.O
It's pretty fun so far!
I like it when I exercise because it makes me feel successful! Like, even if I didn't do anything else that day, I finished a tough blogilates workout!
Aw, thank you (:. I'm proud of you too!
;3 I should keep some secrets.. I like talking with you too!. Is there anything you'd like to share?
Okay!! (:
!*
Thanks!. Sweet dreams, just in case I fall asleep :3
One good thing might be metro accessibility, and check the hotel website too, because they often charge for parking!. Check where it is on the map too! Close to my house is not required, but close to activities would be good!
Or near the metro is fine too!
Sleep tight, Peter!. I love you!!
Thank you for being super understanding and nice ^-^
I can explain more tomorrow!. Night night
Goodnight!
Oh, what's this?
That sounds good!. Don't forget, metro is sort of expensive.. Well, it'll just be about 4-5 from Vienna to DC. But it adds up!
Did you book it already?
It's actually a 29 minute walk to the metro, which seems pretty far!
What's the budget? Do you need any help looking?
With or without parking?. Let's go with "with"
The Tysons Corner Westin is $168.54 and then + $10/night for parking. I can split it with you too.
Yes, that's fine by me!
Probably make it now just in case the rate goes up!. http://www.westintysonscornerhotel.com/. Don't forget to use the SPG discount. I have a sign in if you don't want to sign up!
Do what?
for pass. username is my school id. Make sure to "Remove message" once you are done!. Messenger -> right click -> delete
Great!
Okay
No worries!
You choose the discount room and then a login screen comes up. When you click Reserve
Nah, I"m going to get to sleep early tonight!
Sure. Oh, what's that?
What is the Reagan Airport Art Show, I mean?
Sounds like you're looking forward to it! Is that this weekend?
Actually, you seem pretty neutral on the subject, but because you're telling me, that might mean you're excited? :P
Is there an option to deliver it in person?. It's pretty close to Tyson's Corner!
I meant that you could drop it off early?
You said it's due next week, right?. Those puppets might be heavy to ship, I bet!
Jewelry lab time?
I wouldn't say this is quite conversing.. More of telling.. Wear what will be comfortable for you(:. Those blue shorts are nice!
Tomorrow I'm going to work past hours since I'm pretty behind! Probably when I get home would be good for a call! Likely 8pm or so. The museums are casual!
Looking forward to hearing about yours too!. What did you do today?
Just don't get heat stroke, please.. We'll be walking a lot!
Friday is a good day to dress up if you want
We could do dinner at the mall, and then a movie
The national mall is quite spread out!. If you wanted to see the monuments!
I went to the zoo recently already, so perhaps something else!. I wouldn't mind going again though!
Cool! It's great that you get so much time to spend with your sisters.
Goodnight to you too!
5!
Good question.. There's bound to be a lot of traffic at the time, so I'm wondering if it would be better to go to the mall first (close to my workplace), and then my house, where I would drop off my car, and then to the hotel.. You're welcome to come a bit earlier to check into the hotel and get the car details settled out!
The shopping mall entrance is here: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/38.9188749,-77.2188126/@38.916884,-77.2234711,16z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0. Yup, I know!
No. I'll meet you with my car at Tysons mall, then we will both go to my house once traffic dies down, then we will take only your car to the hotel.
Good call. :P
Bye!
I love you too!. You won't be able to check in with out my credit card, so we can meet at the mall
Hmm can't think of anything at the moment
Those taste good!. I am pretty set in the snack department though!
You could bring them along!. Is there a microwave and fridge at the hotel?
Pictures?. How about the pictures?. ** I meant :P
Okay!. Thanks for checking.
That great!
Goodnight to you too!!. I hope you have a safe drive over!
By the way, meet me at my house at 5:20pm!. 8417 Amanda Place, Vienna, VA. We can eat here and then go to the hotel and movies!
No thanks :P
Don't worry, I have enough snacks!
I'm okay, thanks!
Just courie yourself over!. I'm going to sleep!
Sweet dreams to you too (:. I love you!
Psst.. would you be open to going to my office a bit on Saturday (maybe after museums close)? I got a but behind on my work somehow and have to prepare for a pesentation on Monday.. bit*. Would you mind picking up my boots at my house before you come over? ( just call my mom at 5405521357 )
Thank you!!
No, that's it for now!. My mom has them already, they are the brown zip up leather ones with the heel
I don't have one either!
I haven't done anything recently! Feel free to get it when you go over. You can have it!
Heading home from work eta 5:20!
Where to go for breakfast?
Something open now?
Also, tips on what to wear to the baseball game tonight?. There's always something open!. Fast food place?
Just something I have?
We will drive straight to the church and regroup!. I love you!!!! I had such a great time with you!
Yay, I'm so glad you've made it alright!!
Yeah!. On to notifications! (:
I'm glad too!! It really helped! (:
You're fine!! (:
Hasn't started yet!
Great!
Do it :3
Hi! I made it home safely!. I'm so proud of you (: I can't wait to see your website!
:D To display your technique!. Sweet dreams (:
Mask?. Google!. Night night!
Hi you!!
I'll call you? :D!
As was I about yours!. Thanks for filling me in!
Did you want to try again?
No, you're fine!
Yeah!. I'll send you a picture tomorrow at work
Good morning, Peter!
(:
Call the spine people and ask about a free spinal consultation!
Going to new York this weekend?
Plz check airbnb for me if you have time. Looking for place <$100 in Manhattan. 07/01-07-03
Make sure neighborhood name at bottom is safe and lots of 5 star ratings. Pleas pick the best one!. Preference to upper east side
Piano :O
No, you, If you want!. I'll be out exploring though, so the guitar and piano won't be much good!
Apply for a capital one credit card!
Get quicksilver!. Or journey,. ?*
Quicksilver is no annual fee
Not sure, I have limited knowledge of either. Journey is the starter college kid one.. (from what I've heard). Just google it!
"starter college kid" one
:P Is this why you like collecting video games?. At least it's not typewriters!
And the ancient pottery collection?. http://www.cardrates.com/reviews/no-credit/. I think you can totally try for Quicksilver. Ohh, that's QuicksilverOne. I see.... Journey might be your best bet then
Neat!
Time for new watercolors?
Oh!! That's good!. I'm reading about NYC. Neighborhoods. I'm thinking Harlem might be fun to stay in!
It's gone already, I think!
Driving seems more convenient than megabus (from what I've seen). Maybe we can find a place with parking.. Overnight parking is hopefully not to expensive!. too*
Wasn't even considering it!
Meh
That's too far North
I'm fine with New Jersey, since we'll be out the whole day anyway!
The one in Harlem is further from Midtown than the Union City listing
I'm still stuck finding a place!
I guess it's okay if it works out with parking!. Would you mind booking it?. Booking something... :P. Also, turn on "private room" in your filter settings
2 guests. You, right?
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12806563?checkin=07%2F01%2F2016&checkout=07%2F03%2F2016&guests=2&s=LQQ_ObTm. I thought this place looked good!
There's more places in Brooklyn to look at if it's not too far from Midtwon. Private room is fine!
Parallel parking is really hard for me. When is Hershey Park again?
And which weekend is the theme park?
Looks good! Just more expensive with parking too
Would you mind messaging about it?
I'd want to book it! But wondering if late check in is okay (11pm at latest, hopefully), and whether we could check out at the right time on Sunday, but leave our car parked there until evening (~8pm). Also want to make sure parking is okay. If not, is there paid parking nearby?
The wording isn't very clear. Didn't mean for you to use my unformatted questions!. Also, we aren't looking for a genuine NYC experience from there place, we just like that it is close to Midtown. and that there is parking!. their*. Instead of mentioning 11pm, say that we are driving up from DC at 4pm, but aren't sure how much traffic to expect.. We will give that an ETA once we are able to pull it up on our GPS. them. read the listing to make sure the questions aren't redundant. Probably don't have to ask about parking, since they say they have parking, just the late parking request.. The listing isn't super clear on parking (free parking with permit), so ask what the parking situation is like.. You can just send it :P I don't need to see it
Oh no, I have so many suggestions for improvement. Don't be so liberal with those tildes! It sounds too unsure. And the first paragraph sounds like a robot. Not very personable at all. What does the listing say about check in?
We can leave DC at 3:30pm.. No tilde. We are worried we might not make it by 9pm though, if traffic is bad. Please don't send me the message, just send it directly to the airbnb host!. Mention that we don't drink, don't smoke, and will be very respectful of the house. And say that we would let them know eta once we leave DC on Friday. Not just that we would have a clear idea
Thanks ;P
RAWR!
Just a daypack that can't be easily broken into. Maybe even less then that.... There's probably advice on what bag to bring to NYC
Backpacks are fine. Just put it in front through crowded areas. No locks needed, but don't just have your wallet hanging out
And take out anything you wouldn't want to lose. Like your exacto blades :P
SOON
Plotting deer
Photo?
Ah, I see.. Sweet dreams to you!
What did you do today?
Neat!. What do you do in all the other time?. Surf the Web?
!
Thank you (:
To book, I thought you put the info in the booking message. Rooms go quickly!
Okay!. Thanks. I love you!
Okay! Any reason given?. We can pay for garage parking, if that was the issue. Would you mind picking out a different place?
It can be anywhere, just make sure it's under $220, that it has at least 2 good reviews, is in a safe neighborhood (get the neighborhood name at the bottom and Google it), and is within 25 minutes ride to Midtown. A bit above budget is fine too
No, we'll do garage parking
Lincoln tunnel park and ride seems like a good option
Sounds good! Will you send the message they sent?
Sweet!. I'm not at work tomorrow so we can leave as soon as you get up here!
Could you ask whether the Lincoln parka dn ride is a good choice?. To leave the car there for the weekend
I might not, since my car is blatantly orange, but I will check it out!. Don't forget to say thank you!. Please plan to stay Sunday and Monday night also for 4th of July festivities!
No, just yourself!!
And whatever you need for the weekend!!
No, you can stay here!
Yes, it's fine!
Good clothes for hot weather!. My new inspiration: http://corot.top/category/code/. The preface: https://www.facebook.com/notes/kat-borlongan/letter-to-the-10-year-old-girl-who-applied-to-the-paris-summer-innovation-fellow/10153524268770740
It's cute!
Sweet dreams!. Meet at my house at 10:30am tomorrow!
Don't forget to eat something!. I'm sure I don't need anything!. Actually..!. Please bring me a pair of scissors.. Just plain school ones are fine!
Not heavy duty!. I plan to use them to cut my hair, so I was hoping you had some sacrificial school ones
Those are too sharp for my fingers ;(
School scissors!. Anything you have available
Since I'm leaving earlier than I thought, could we let them know that we will be checking in around 5:30pm?
We can go explore and check in at the time we said of course, if that works better for them.
I love you too!!. Also, raining tomorrow, so bring an umbrella perhaps?
One is fine!. I have my rain jacket!. Sleep, you!. :3. Good night!
Yes!
Bring a pillow!
No, see you tomorrow!
No problem! (: eta?
Hi, still on time?. Wondering if I should stop by the post office. Before or after you get here. I'll go after!
!!
No, my bad
find good parking
Getting gas. Jk. I'm at the top deck on the right. Closer to the back near a baby stroller. At the meeting spot (:
In front of the moon lander. On the balcony. Meet in lobby! By check in
Have a great drive home! Don't forget to check on oil/tires (: I love you!
Home? (". (:
Yesterday! From the Lincoln Memorial
I'm in Richmond!
How is your family?
Oh good! The trip was great, we just had dinner! We are thinking we'll make an atm drone
You have an AR code that it sends to your phone and the drone uses a camera to read it
Friday!
I love you so so much!. Good morning!
Hi!
We're still looking for a name!. DroneATM. :P. EverywhereATM. We didn't like that last one, but I think it sounds more friendly than "drone"
:P haha
Thank you (:. We are making an app to go with in.. it*. Maybe we need some killer design asthetics.. I'll send you a mockup when we have it.
We're making it in iOS, so the mockups might not be useful unless we can implement them. Maybe checkout xCode app design. We do need like an info slide to explain the idea!. Could be similar to the p2p atm we did. With the three circles
:P. Too confusing. But possible!. Doesn't really get the idea across. if you don't already know what it is
But what about the ATM part?. More like withdraw cash anywhere... No atm.. no problem :P Same marketing as the p2p atm. But with drones
The drone isn't an Atm. Just a cash dispenser
No, they work togethee. Together*. You request withdrawl on the phone and the drone brings you the money
Incorporate the capital one logo and a drone flying if you can. No deadline really!
I love you!. I can't wait to see you on the 23rd!
Still there?. Whatcha got?
Wow, that's so cool!
I like it!!
I like the color one!
It's great!. Please send the transparencies too
Wow, that is cool!. Nothing I can think about right now
Hmm, might come in handy!
Both?. Any luck on the display screen?. Perhaps an image of a drone in the back and then the things you made from pen apps. "no money? no atm? no problem? (pic of drone)
Big enough to fit on a 22" Monitor. Big enough to look good*. Or just your screen is fine
I'm not actually sure how big the monitor is :P
Oh, my sister said that she could!. Unless something changed
It's only 7 minutes out of the way!
I'm looking forward to seeing you!
How does the thingy look?. Could you send the white logo png too?
Oh Cool! Could you make it like the one from PennApps with a nice background and circles and text and a logo?. The atm looks a little intense. Compared to the other two icons. But that's fine!
That's pretty sweet! Is it possible to do the "colored in" white for the icons?. Also, how does it looks with not all caps?. And could you put a little tagline under the logo that says "DroneATM"?
Or like.. Drone Cash Delivery. Like from omni cash. Do you have a white logo with the shadow?. Thank you so much by the way!. DroneATM is fine as the tagline. Actually, don't worry about the shadow!. Nice!. Haha, I can't tell if I like the colored in or not. Maybe send one with the lowercase but solid shapes
Thank you!!. Good morning!
Crunch time !
We won best hardware hack! $. Thanks for your help!
Thank you!! (:
^-^. I will show you the working demo sometime... Definitely going to sleep now!
(: Goodnight!!. Call?
Oh good! Have fun!. I was just going to tell you about the new ride at Busch Gardens called Tempesto :P. See you tomorrow!
:3. I love you!
Woo, Busch Gardens today! !. Good morning!
Thank you for an awesome weekend!. And for helping my Mom!!!
Peter!
Need hugs!. :3. The hugs, Peter!. ^-^. Thank you again for a great weekend and all your help!
I love you too!
How are you doing back at home?
I'm doing well!! Just applied to a hackathon, cut some mangoes, ate a tomato, and am reading Pride and Prejudice!. You must've been tired from the short sleep last night!
5 feet?. 6 feet?. What kind of a sleep is that? :P
No, I mean't 5 ft 11 :P
meant*
No, just naming a height that your sleep was ("It was taller than I am"). I think I missed the joke!
I thought your sleep was pretty short!. 6ish hours?. A bit below average at least
Unknown!
Which day are we going to Hershey Park?. Also, are there enough accommodations for me?
Are you all staying overnight on Friday?. Saturday would work well, in that case!
Okay! May I come on Friday and stay until Sunday, then?
Okay (:. Sweet dreams to you, Peter!!
Good morning,  Peter!!
Huggable!
I haven't looked at them yet, but I'm looking forward to it!. Looks good!
Goodnight!. I love you!. Do you like The Avett Brothers?. Or does any other artist catch your eye?
http://www.sprintpavilion.com/events/all
Yup!. Well I"m not sure ;P
Thanks!
Good morning!. Call the back people today :P
Chiropractor seems good!
^-^. How was your day yesterday and today? Up to anything?
Neat! What did you do with them?. My days have been very good!
Pokemon Go?  I have been practicing breakdancing and guitar, reading Pride and Prejudice, practicing interview questions, and briefly learning Chinese and linear algebra!
Why is it silly?
Were there really that many?
That's interesting!! I wonder whether it will be a lasting effect.
It's actually a cleverly designed exercise campaign.. How many miles did you guys log? :P
Oh good!
Better than the pokewalker!
I am thinking if I spend an hour practicing breakdancing instead of working out each day (and then maybe do the workout one day a week), then I could progress more quickly!
Oh yes, stretches~!
*phew* Get tired so quickly...
Yeeee. :D
We can salsa too!
Both!
What new thing did you get done on your website?
June 13th: "Nearly forgot about the Wizard of Oz puppets, which need to be finished!". Is that still a thing?
Oh okay!  Just checking in on that.
When is the art show?
Oh, I didn't know!. I'm off to sleep!. Also, glad that your website is almost done!
It wasn't supposed to be judgmental by the way-- I had just thought you might have forgotten and wanted to remind you!. Maybe it's something that's bothering you if you took it that way?
What would you recommend I say instead to bring it up?
How many hours a day would you say you are actively working on getting a job?
No, don't make this a pity party. I am just curious.
I'd say any less than 3 and you should probably be working harder.. I don't want to make you feel bad, I just want you to help yourself more.. Like.... Just do it.. Just sit down, and don't do anything else until you've put in enough work per day.. Treat it like homework.
Would he prefer you not find a job?
Then tell him whats what.. If you're not finding a job, then you better be working for him, since he's buying you food.
(to echo your father's thoughts). I don't know the whole situation, but I'm absolutely sure your father wants you to find a job, and you should tell him that. It sounds like an excuse you're using to not keep working.
Maybe he doesn't see you working on it often, so he thinks you aren't doing anything important.. "important"
Really how much time would you estimate you've been spending each day?
That's good! Keep that up then!. As long as you are working actively on it, it will get done.. But make sure the time you are using is productive time.. Read up on how to find jobs in your field.. Just do it...!
Also... please send me money as soon as you can!
Last 4 digits of my account are 6339
That's fine.. Thanks!
Good night, Peter!
I love you!! :3
I don't actually need any, I was just feeling bad that you hadn't paid me back. But it's fine. I don't even know how much it is!. Just make sure what you do have is collecting interest somewhere
Did you want to just pay me back for the most recent NY/DC expenses and then call the rest a gift?. I can add it up for you!
How much would you want to pay for though?  Japan trip was pretty expensive. I can add that in if you want too (just the plane ticket+rail pass). I just like travelling a lot, and I'll probably have to pay for you most of the time if I want you to come along!. It doesn't make complete sense you should have to pay for something you didn't opt into
Sure thing!. + Japan airbnbs?. And what about spring break?  :P. I recall you gave me some sum for that..
Okay, Peter!. I want to spend time with you!. Skype session today?
Okay!! (: 5:30pm?
RaWR!
This code has me stumped :O
Thanks :3
No, thank you for the encouragement!
Thanks!. Sorry the call didn't work out :( !
I was really looking forward to it!
What were you expecting?
How are you? What are some highlights of your day?
I'm good!!
Guitar, then reading Pride and Prejudice! Next on the roster is Linear Algebra, Chinese, and Interview
Oh good!
I just thought we'd be chillin' on video chat the whole time while I was playing guitar and reading and practicing and whatnot
Did you still want to do that?
Oh I'd want to!!. Oh, are you offline?
Video call!!!
What do you think of this? http://www.musicmidtown.com/. Also, enter the giveaway on the homepage!. It ends tomorrow night
Oh good!. Pass it on to your friends too, if you like!
Video call time!
Good morning Peter!
:D
You cutie!
Thank you! We're volunteering with middle schoolers! You have a great day too (:
I hope it goes well!!!
Nice! Hot day today there?. It's 97 here!
Oh good!!
Hi you!
Let's. Ideo chat!
Do you think Peter can help drive me to Salem for my surgery on August 4th, plus wait for me and then drive me back? Aunty Shelia has been hired as a Special Ed teacher in Franklin County and will have started work by then... :( Hopefully, she can still help me out on the 27th.. if not, perhaps Peter can also help with that? What do you think? Should I ask Peter?. From my mom!
(:
(Hug). Good morning to you too!
You too!!
I got tagged by the secret Google coding challenge! ( search "Google" foobar
Yup!
It's an alternative to the phone screening, I think. But you still do the in person interview
Oh no, what's wrong?. Internal feeling or external?
Any way to explain what you're feeling? I'm doing well! Just metroing back from the National mall!
It was really great! My friend did some photography and we walked and talked.. How was your day?
Neat! Are you having a good time? What are you painting?
Oh yeah, your vision! I'm looking forward to seeing that!!. Oh wow!!
His face looks very expressive!. Faces are hard!
Back home!
No, it sounds sweet!. I'm going to go brush my teeth and then maybe you can elaborate on that weird feeling!
But you must understand your feelings!!. Unless it is depression?. I hear that is difficult to understand
Oh, tell me about it!
Twin connection?
Do you have any ideas at all?
It's not a worry, but it's strange that you are having feelings you can't control.
Feelings that you can't grasp, I mean.
Hopefully you'd have some idea about why you feel a certain way!. Otherwise, how would you be able to control that feeling?. You can control how you feel.. I can feel sad right now if I wanted to.. Or any number of emotions!
https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ambigamy/201006/total-control-vs-no-control-theory-emotions-can-you-control-your-emotions-or ( from 2010 though). Life is an act -- you choose how you want to act.. We're not just primitive "animals". We have control over our actions and responses
You can calm down if you're angry, and you can cheer up if you're sad.. Just takes some effort on our parts. But anyway, my original thought was just that it's strange that you didn't know why you felt a certain way.
If I'm sad, there is always some reason. Even if I'm not sure what it is yet.. What were you doing?. at the time?
Hmm, was the cause of sadness from leaving Gap? Did anything get brought up while you were with Gap that would cause you to be sad? Shouldn't you be happy after spending time with a friend?
That sounds like reason to feel sad.
It seems so elementary to be trying to understand the source of feelings on this level. What do you think?
Oh, which artsy photo?
Did my friend, Frank upload some?
Wow, he is fast!
No, it's a common thought. I was speaking with my friend Eric and he mentioned one of his relationships did not work out because the girl had too many friends who were guys. He commented that he knew he was being immature in retrospect.. I totally understand how it can be an issue though.. But they are just friends. I mean, if I were bisexual, then you'd have to worry about any friends in general!
Do you think the fact that they are guys is the main factor?
It's not silly, it's sounds like a normal sort of thought process.. But in relationships, people do tend to have other friends and do fun activities with those friends, so it seems like one of the things you have to cope with!. Also, for the "falling for them" part, I suppose that's also a possibility, but I'm not exactly looking for a boyfriend so it doesn't quite apply.
You'd just have to trust that our relationship is strong enough, and if it's meant to be us then it will be.. I'd better get off to sleep now!
Just curious, did you mean to bring this up from the start of introducing your sadness, or did you really not know where it came from?
That's strange! From a depression prone person, it seems like that could be a warning sign.. Keep an eye on those sad feelings and let someone know if it worsens!
Goodnight!
30th weekend!. Sweet dreams (:
Good morning!. Up early? What's up for you today?
Miss out on what?
Oh, are you exercising with me today? (:. But what have you been up to, I meant?
Ah, okay!
Sweet! I'm planning on reading a bit, and then starting in 10-15
One more chapter, you think?
The book is so engaging.... Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.. !. I'm ready to commence exercise though!. I'm glad to not already know the ending of this story.
It will continue after exercise and shower and breakfast!. A friend is coming over at 1:30pm to play guitar and after that is DDR and Battlefront fun!. Somehow I can't seem to make any acquaintances with girls, so they are both guys again.
They are equally fun, I would say!
Will you be joining me, or shall I wish you goodbye?
Okay, that's very nice of you! We will also be celebrating my brother's birthday, so it can serve as a double.
I'm not sure that I will be visiting Pennslyvania though!
Well it totally depends on if you've applied to some places or not!. I want to be pretty strict on that in hopes that it helps to motivate you!
Well I'll stick to it!. In my head it makes sense-- it's not too hard to apply to some serious places and you've been speaking on it for a while now.
No, still caught up in my book :P. But I did the warm up!
No, I can't remember!
I'm not certain!
How would I hint at it? A direct question would do!
Ah, that's just a question! No longer a hint
Ah, I've missed it then!
I certainly could! I've decided I'll just ask him outright though.
He says ice cream cake!
We'll just get one when we're there!
That sounds nice!. Any thoughts on an Indie Game Studio name!. ?*
Thanks! Keep them coming if you have any other ideas!
I made it back!. I'll go wash up and then video chat?
Oh, I was asleep though!
No ideas yet on my side :P. And there are some art designers on the team, so they might like to make a logo!
Thanks!
That's too bad that you feel that way!. Do you happen to own any shin guards?. Or adult sized knee/elbow pads?. Or a certified skateboard helmet, by chance? :P
Only if it's a certified helmet. Triple 8 is the one I was looking at on Amazon I might just buy a new one!
I definitely would! You'd need a decent skateboard/protective gear too though.. https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/for/5684815578.html. This one is my back-up choice if you are interested
I mean, that is the back-up :P. So the one I am looking at is a different one!. https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/spo/5686302897.html
That question is confusing :P
No, but they're not always on the market. Especially in Blacksburg
Thanks!. A few ideas about thwat?. what*
What about the skateboard?
What are your ideas?
I mean, what are your ideas about acquiring a skateboard?. Also, what are those ideas?. (Not just what kind of idea)
It's way easier/less expensive just to buy one.
And I care more about rideability than aesthetic, so I don't see any benefit in making one over buying one.. I wouldn't want you to make something I'm not going to use!
You're welcome to make yourself one, but there's no way you can do that for less than $30. I wouldn't use it because it almost certainly wouldn't ride as well as a manufactured one.. Plus, it'd be way more expensive. You'd still have to buy the hardware, which run about $50 for the decent kind I'd want!. runs*. I'd say save your self the trouble and find a craft project you'd rather be spending time on :P. I know you have many
Not for a good 2 years with the amount of riding I want to do.
Feel free to make one for yourself though!. By the way, what do you define as "easy to make"? :P
I guess I meant... How many hours does something "easy to make" take to make?. Time is a good measure.. Or money spent.
That's amazing. And it rides well?. :P
And does tricks well?. Or is this just a cruiser?
Well I am skeptical that you can get the concavity right. But if you can spend less than $30 on a complete (with hardware) handmade skateboard, and it takes you one day, then you are a miracle worker!. Because this one on craigslist costs only $30.
It's good for a beginner!. Girl skateboard decks are well rated, and royal trucks are decent. Definitely better than a target/walmart skateboard.
No, if this is just for me, you shouldn't.. Just focus on what you need to do. I'm getting a board sooner than you could make one.
Don't get sidetracked with making cakes and making skateboards.. Just do your stuff.
Aw, thanks ^-^
Too much color editing :P. ?*
Oh thanks!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCL2260ISTs
Haha :P
Well thanks for watching!
Rawr, Goat!
Derp
The one with you and the rabbit is nice.. If you know of any I have that you want me to send, let me know!
Hehe, nice picture.
And me too!
Is it because I'm so sneaky? :3
I like you too!
It's not on the way though!
Remind me again when you gave it to me!
Remind me what we did that day before you left?. I think I definitely left the hard drive at my house so you'd be able to pick it up. By the way, the only way I am not going to Pennsylvania is if you don't apply anywhere :P. So that should be an easy fix
Hmm, what did we eat for breakfast?
Oh yeah, I remember!. Very cool!
Leave Facebook?. I don't understand what's wrong. Could you explain it?
Goodnight!
What were you hoping for?
Not when you've been so purposely sparse without explanation. Feels like a cold shoulder
I understand that much. Doesn't it seem immature to you to do things like that?. I mean, what's the goal?. Hopefully you reached it!. Sorry, I'd better get to sleep. Good night, I'll get back to you when I wake up!
Please warn me next time if you want to do that kind of experimenting!
It skews them more to do it in this fashion, because it's hard to miss you when I know you are purposely not chatting with me and reasoning in this way.. It reminds me of someone who runs away from home just to prove they are missed. And sure, they might be missed, but you sure are upset at them for messing with you like that, and if they're not a kid then you really think their judgement amiss.. Let me know by tomorrow if I should come to Hershey Park!
No, I really really want to come, but I won't  unless you have applied to jobs.
It's not a reward, it's to get you to do it asap. Which, based on your actions, you do need.. Because you should have applied by now. It's okay to still be decided what you want to do, but I can't see that you've made a big effort to research companies/careers.. And I know it's not my decision to make, but I feel like it'd be really beneficial if you get started on it sooner than later. Still be deciding*. And you don't have to go straight to the "workforce," but you should have some idea of where you want to go (aka, career, goals, and plan of action for getting there).. And then actually act on it.. What are your thoughts?
Any impediments? Do you feel like you have a good idea of how to do what you want to? It seems like you've been missing your self-set deadlines. But if it were a school project, I bet you could've finished on time, so I know you had no reason to miss the deadlines
Why isn't finding a job your #1 priority?
What does that mean?
Yes, I think you should talk with your dad and tell him finding a job is your highest priority.. But you'd have to actually be working at it and making progress!. The worst he could do is kick you out. But that seems unlikely. When you said "you can't help it", that's totally untrue. You have complete control over you schedule. Comments?
Goodnight! Any highlights from today,. ?*
Neat!
Oh good!
That's great. Goodnight!
Yes, but I'd rather stay healthy and sleep.. So sweet dreams!
Yes in general! :3
Wow!! I will look at it shortly!
Is there a way to make the About Me section feel more personable?. Maybe look at some example "about me"s on other sites. It also has a typo
Oftentimes the about me section is explaining your "personal brand". You should use adjectives to describe yourself and talk about what skills you have and why those skills are beneficial. Like the way you mention being detail oriented --- you should followup saying why that is beneficial. https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/best-practices-for-effective-design-of-about-us-pages/. The internet can help!
Do you need help with that? If you give me that job posting, I'll tell you exactly what I would do in your position
Another resource : http://www.howdesign.com/articles/building-personal-brand-graphic-designer/. Is that under "Employer information?"
I'm googling around to see how other people have handled it. My first instinct was to either put N/A, or some other experience that isn't quite a job, but still shows experience.. Do they allow you to list your resume later on?
Under Most Recent Title, maybe put "Student"?
The first box N/A
Unless you want to count Camp Invention as an employer (which is applicable, since we were paid)
But definitely put some more expression/personality into any of your writings! Especially the About Me section and any essay questions or cover letters. Just try and make it as enjoyable and fun to read as possible, while still highlighting your best qualities and skills
Look at the articles I sent. The first one is examples, which you can draw from, and the second is a how-to guide. Feel free to google for your own resources too.. I'm not sure how often you google for things when you're unsure of something, but I think it's okay to make it a habit because there is definitely a lot to learn!. Just remember, not everything on the internet is true.... Like the examples may not necessarily be good examples--use your judgement
Oh I never assume!
That's awesome!. Is there anywhere you can incorporate a nice photo of yourself too?. So they know that your nose isn't bright pink?
How about in the Contact me section?. Could even be another drawing of you waving, or something. As long as it looks like you :D. Your social medias have your picture, so they could always get there with another click.. Add some skills to your linkedIn (it's easy), so that recruiters can find you. Also link to your website on your linkedin!
Yay, go Peter!. Now people can endorse you and you can endorse them back :P
The day's not over!. So you're good!. Cool face!
They certainly aren't lacking in customers!
Oh good!. I just remembered that I may not have a ride to get to Hershey Park!. The power steering belt on my car broke on the way home from work
It's not hard to replace, if there wasn't any other damage, but the part might take a while to come in!. I think there is likely a bus I can take!
Me either, but it's the best back-up option I can think of!. When are you guys leaving on Friday?
Do you think you might be able to pick up another thing for me at my mom's house?
It's the elbow and knee pads you gave me!. I left the wrist protectors in Cville, so I might have to buy a new set...
Okay, thanks!
No, that's it.. It think that seems really unreasonable though. There are plenty more car part providers here than near Blacksburg, I'm sure.. Also, Cville is an hour out of the way with a quick map search-- if you go that much out of the way, I'd rather you pick me up instead :P
No, It's pretty crazy to go an hour out of the way on a 5 hour drive.. 20% increase in time!. I'll just hope the car gets fixed quickly -- or there is always the Greyhouse. Greyhound*. Good night!
Good morning!
Hmm, what's that mean?
I definitely haven't forgotten you
How so?
Okay!
My day has been good!! I've been networking more at work. I'm going to have to work extra hard to get my project finished before the end of the internship!! I went to a driving range on Tuesday and hit balls for 4 hours, resulting in sore hands :P. I got a skateboard and am learning to ride it. Got a cool app for learning Mandarin!. How about you?
Oh, how is the illustration going?
I would like to go!
Yes, I'm sure I'd like to go :D. Yes, I think a bus might be a bit expensive ($65 round trip) given the car repair costs. They are moving along with the repair pretty speedily , so I might be able to drive
They say they are done!
It was!
I trust they have done a good job! But I will test it out a bit this evening and driving to work tomorrow morning. I'll ask about whether they have any concerns
Nice! Well go for it if you want! But keep up the job search :P. Just on the price estimate front.. grip tape is $7, bearings and hardware are $15, low end trucks (royal) are $15-20, wheels are $10 (spitfire ones are $25). And bushings? Not sure if those come with trucks
If you want to. I don't believe you could make a nicely concave on that flips well. Or at least not on the first try. It's way less expensive for companies to just manufacture those things. One*. If you just want to paint it, then get a nice blank deck.. But the paint eventually gets all scratched up...!
I'm going out to skateboard a bit, but after that!
No, not yet. But I'll have the elbow pads soon :D
Okay! Could you bring a helmet?. A bike one is fine... for now
Oh, have you gone to any of those? :D
No, I mean this summer.. Or what did you mean by sending it?
It's different for each movie theater
There is a link to check locations
You can always watch the movie another time!. What is the address to go to tomorrow?
It was tons of fun!
Nope, I'm all set!. Thank you for picking those up for me!
Oh, okay.
Is there a swimming pool?
Thanks!. It looks like there are many water rides, so I will.
Also, there is a pool
At "Bluegreen Vacation Suites". I read indoor. Jk
Does everyone know I am coming for the weekend?
Okay, good!
Yes!
What are you worried about?
I love you!
No, but I think there are definitely some issues to work out.
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!!
Good morning!
I love you too!
I have tortilla chips for your family!
Aw, jk there's not that many..
9pm!
No need to! I'm bringing tacos. Might be able to get there at 8pm if traffic doesn't get worse. I'm leaving at 5
I can save you one!
Would you like me to?
But does that mean that you didn't think I considered that before offering you one?. :P Just musings..
Read the above again, was it clear enough?
I meant that I wouldn't offer you something if I didn't want to give it to you. If a poor person wanted to give you $5 for helping them with something, would you accept it?
Okay, well doesn't not accepting mean that you don't trust their judgement in giving it to you? That you don't believe they are wise enough to make their own decisions?
Does that then mean that you are too proud to accept a gift?. Because you want to preserve your charity?
The topic just came up in class one day and I wanted to see what your thoughts were on the subject
How so?
Here is the post, if you're interested.
Ah, sorry, hard to copy and paste all. Well just let me know if you are interested. Driving over now!. Eta 8pm, where to park?
Still arrive at 8pm
Just let me know the name
Arrived!
No problem. Am I still to meet you there or should I wait in the Clubhouse?
I could wait here! Reading pride and prejudice :P
It's air conditioned inside, I bet!
I think I'm fine near the registration area?
I'll wait in the car! It's not hot
Okay !
Oh no, hope you didn't answer
Okay, accidental call
I'll just be chilling in the car! Just reading, as I said.
One day sounds fine to me, though Sunday would also work. Just stay the whole day! :D
I made it back!!
Why so quiet?. Goodnight!
Okay, I didn't know. Sweet dreams to you!. Thank you for the water!
Yeah, I just thought we would talk a bit beforehand :o Goodnight!
You too!
Yup! It was very suspenseful!. I switch to music a quarter of the way through. Sleeping now though (: Goodnight
Good morning! !#
Check out the url!!!
It is deployed in dev! (So someone else could reach it online
It's internal
No, I just have to think in my head :P
Any ideas for a cool name for my admin dashboard instead of "admin dashboard"?
How about something unrelated to the creator?. :P
Hehe. Can we brand that?. Looks like it's already a company
It's an admin dashboard used to help in development where you can monitor logs and application health and whatnot
See, I thought you said "Eros"
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_(concept). Was thinking of the types of love
Yup, it's like lust
Aw, thank you! :P
I liked Polaris a lot!
Perhaps.... Polaris still wins!. Can it be a polar bear logo?
It can be the movie poster one!

Oh yeah, I meant the round one ! The other one is easier to clean
Most likely!. It's the best name so far. Another regular hairbrush would be nice too, but I like mine a lot and how it is missing a handle :P
Woo! Font options?
Something lowercase?. Like the inform logo
Brb
I'm just here (:
That sounds great!!. I have not seen them yet, but am looking forward to it!
That looks very cute!
Thank you for being my rubber duck!!
Are you free the weekend of 17th-18th?
Midtown Music Festival
Do you think we'd be able to drive back Sunday night?. I have class 10am Monday
Okay! We can sleep in Sunday too, that way we're no so tired (it starts at noon each of the days). I found an Airbnb that is just $35 a night!
Nope, I just have to book, and then I'm good!
I love you too!!!. Which is your Airbnb account?
Cool! I added you!
You just login though the email, and it will correct it. (It will send you an email)
Sweet dreams!
Good morning!. Could you send the text and polar bear separately?. (the solid upright bear). Just kidding, I just cropped them
Yeah!
It's a bit big though
I'm not looking for one, but maybe I'd use a new one if I got one very similar!. I remember mine was really inexpensive though (2.99)?
I got it from walmart, but I like the size and how easy it is to clean. It is also very durable!
I don't have a ruler on me
The brush handle was hollow and used to hold hairties. Have fun at Hershey Park!!!
Wow, are those commissary tickets?
Oh, how much?
Oh good, how early can you go the day before?
Enjoy your day!!!. (:. I miss you
How nice :D. Did he teach you to swim? :P
That sounds like fun! We need to practice cornhole sometime!
Oh, which movie is that?
That's interesting. I was curious why they didn't teach medicine and I found that it was because of suspected witchcraft. Surprising!. I have been working on my presentation slides and my project. I'm about to head home to eat dinner and work some more on the project!. I was also resolving a UPS package issue
Oh definitely, I'm running into a lot of issues and am not quite sure what to do next!
Haha, maybe I'll do that!
I'll try my best!
Thank you (: I love you too!! Enjoy Hershey Park!
Aw :( You can be the single rider who fits everywhere !!
At least a lot of the rides fit 4 people!. Are you the fifth?
Maybe you can be a group of 2 and 3!
I love you!!! Sweet dreams!
I hope you're having a fun day!
I am looking forward you to hosting you at work the last week!. Still need to check with Daniel~. Is it still so hot?
I love you too!
Goodnight!
I love you too!
You sure do!
Good morning!!
I love you!!!!!
Online?
Amazing!
The kit Kat struggles?
I'm not sure that Amazon would be tax free also.
I can't think of anything I want that's not online!
No, but the saving of online deals is normally more than the tax cost. Maybe going to a clothing store would be best!
Shopping in Virginia?. Haha, where is "here"?. Also, you said the tax free benefits only start tomorrow
Ah okay! Well, enjoy your last day in Hershey!
No thanks!. Did you go to Hershey's Chocolate World and factory tour?
It looks pretty cool!!
Really really! It'd be neat to see how it's made :D
Nah, I wouldn't go back for it. But if I were already there, I would consider going!
Why's that?
You don't have any plans for the rest of the day, do you?
You get free chocolate at the end...!. Also, today is National Milk Chocolate day!
You get to sample exclusive Kisses flavors!
Haha :P. Well you might be able to convince people to check it out after dinner if you want. They are open til 11
Haha :P That's a new one
Aw, I'm sorry! If you want to go, you should be allowed ti. to*. This is so cool! https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar
Lot's of lessons about their processes.. Looks like fun to learn :D
No problem!. Better than Crazy Ex-Girlfriend perhaps :P. Well, not better--just different.
Aw, that's too bad
Ah, okay!. Any family games?
Awesome!
I love you too! Did you find your way to Friendly's again?. My day was great!. I've been a bit sleepy the past two days, but I got more done today, which was great!
I have not been conversing with a duck!. I don't have a favorite soup; I like to mix it up! But anything that seems healthy is good in my book!
Veggies are preferred over rice and pasta in soup.. I haven't had cannoli yet, but I have had 3 this summer!
Oh good!
Oh, thank you :D
I'm so glad ^-^
Thanks for continuing to be a great person to have in my life!
Yay!!!. Was it okay?
Oh good :Dd
Goodnight!!
Thank you!
Thanks :D
Deleting old files on my computer to make room for Windows 10! Did you update your OS recently, too?
Maybe tomorrow.. Sweet dreams (:
Heh heh
Milkduds!. I love you!!
That's Duck Donuts!
It's in CVille, we also went to the original in Duck, NC
Ahhhhhhh, horse!!!!!
That sounds so cool!!!
I'm glad you're safe! I love you!. My mom cancelled her second surgery,  so she no longer needs a ride!
Okay, I will!! Thank you! (:. Good luck applying for more jobs :3 Don't forget to do it as soon as you can because it often takes 3 weeks or more to hear back!
I love you!!!
Yay it's you!!. I'm at the beach!!
The water is so cool and nice ^-^
The sour cream leaked and is really thick now :P but the cheesecake is fine !. I should've kept a better eye on the container
I like your company. What are you up to? :3
Okay! (: How is the progress on that?
Great!!  Is she in some of the videos?
Aw :3. I'm glad they are doing well together!
Whoa, when would th at be?
Just make sure it is not Aug 6-12 when I plan to capture you
Exactly! You should get a date out of him :P
That's good!. I hope you have an awesome day, Peter!. Talk to you later
Thank you!
I will!
;)
Like you ?
Oh yay!!
Next stop, Niagara Falls!
Let's go swimsuit shopping!
Yay! :D I want something that won't fall off easily
Yes :P
Okay! We'll go to the swimsuit stores!
Or the beach!
I will be! I think I think meant, "at the beach"
Have any boogie boards?
Hmmm. They might be pretty inexpensive!
Okay!! (: I feel like my future house would be full of fun activities like skates and swim gear and instruments and boogie boards
No, nothing like that
Nah, just go to the local park. I wouldn't want a swimming pool either. Too much upkeep
What would your house look like?
That's interesting!
Yes, most likely!
Goodnight!
Okay! Have fun!
Enjoy the beach#. !*
It will be better that way!
Well that way you spend lots of time with Gap!
I love you too!. My family is okay.
Haha, whoops sounds so blunt.. They are okay. I really need to help out my Mom and her house when I go back though,  I hear it's gotten really bad
No, you just work on employment :D. Did you still want to come visit me next week?
Me too!! (:
Whoa, you're there the whole week?
Oh, okay!!
Has this trip been planned for sometime?
Wow, airbnb?. Beachfront? :O
Neato!. Get Boogie boards!!
Yay!! Get some good ones!
No, she won't be having it for another year or so!. Hello!. Rawr!. *attack*
*revives *. Wish you were here!. How are you?
Yay you!!!!. I'm glad you're having fun!. :3 Please send cuddles next week
Direct sounds best (:. I am good!!! Missing you though
Jump on the beds for me!!
I'll just jump on you!. :3
^-^ I'll go easy on you... the first time. Sweet dreams you cutie! !
Awww!!! :3
Thank you!!
:D !!
That's great! What did you do there?
That sounds like so much fun!
Misako's?
Ah, I Didn't know! Maybe tomorrow :P
Whoops
Yum!! That sounds delicious.
I miss you too, Peter!
Good morning!
:3. You too, Peter!!!. More beach?
Oh good!! Too bad it was storming!
Sounds like a ton of delicious food!
I mean your whole trip :D
I have been good! Staying late at work again and still trying to finish :P
Maybe... I'm not sure I can have you by my desk or anything
Okay (:
That would be ideal.. Just kidding :P
I am (:
Don't you worry about that!!
Goodnight!
Thank you!!
I'm getting enough rest! :3 I might need help practicing my presentation later, but I think I'm mostly alright! Is today the day you are riding back to Blacksburg? Have a safe trip if so! !
Oh, thank you :3
Is that a hint!. ?*
Wow, so much food!!. Get the strawberry cheesecake :D
Om nom nom!
It was good!
How about a light cannoli cake?
Ah, cake isn't so important!. But thank you!
Are you on the way home now?
Safe travels!
Thank you! ! I'm glad you got back safely
How is your day proceeding?
It's good!
Hi! I'd like to call you too!. I'm in a call right now for the game studio!
Sweet, thanks!
Also goodnight for later!!
No!. I thought you had left already.. I'm just getting ready for bed!
Okay!. What to call in the meantime?
want*
Have a good trip!
I'm not attached to the one I lost!. Thanks for thinking of me though!. Yes, I'll be coming to stepping out both days!
What did you say in Italian? I can't make sense of it
Where is it from?. It'd be nice to know what you intended
Poetry is tough to translate; I don't know enough Italian  :P
No, did you go today?. Hmm, why was it in Italian? And why the poor translation?
It seems a very bad translation, though I don't know Italian.. seems like*. I am in Blacksburg
You'll see me tomorrow, I bet!
Why did you stop following me?. Go past the stairs
No, there's a chair near an outlet by the bathroom
Meet me there, I'm getting food
(:. I love you!!
Get some beef jerky!. (Above coffee maker)
initech: tpsreport. Also, feel free to grab any food from the kitchen!
Leaving soon!
You should go to the auditorium :P
Just finished presentations!. I'll be down for the lunch. You should catch the last talk if you can
Yes!. It's going well, but I'm a bit sleepy!
Maybe maybe!
2nd. Fish tacos!. Closes at 2pm
Where are you?
Okay. I have the key I'll be at the church parking lot
Where'd you go?
Okay!
It's okay, we didn't watch any movies!
Oh yeah maybe!
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!. I got new skateboard bearings, so I will be testing those out tomorrow morning!
I have a helmet, but no pads!
Is my head my bucket?. Sweet dreams!
Brain bucket?
Good night!
? What did you mean to send?
Oh, whoops!
Skateboarding ! Maybe pick up a sub from firehouse subs
Those involve purchases :0
I'm just cleaning out my room so far!
Okay!
That sounds good! I can give you a ride! I may need to shower later though
Well we could do something tomorrow maybe!
Thank you!. I hope you have a fantastic day too!. Is your wii still all packed up and working for Just Dance?
I'm going skateboarding soon !
I'm not sure where... know of any parking lots?
We can drop some clothes off at goodwill?
Just the wii and some controllers and whichever just dance you have!
Just Xbox controllers if you have some to borrow!
Also two wii controllers!. Aww, I miss getting ready with you
I won't even put it on then!! :3
Good suggestion!. Or harding ball court. May I pick you up?
Tank top is great!. Be there at 1:45 then!
Are you really up for help me organize my room? :P
Pink!
?!,#!!!??#
Oh no worries then!. Status report?. On the way to get you!
Here
The sub is no more
Om nom nom
Heading home now!
I made it home!. I love you too!
Did you spend some time with Cody?
Can we plan on a time?
Like... 8:30am?. Oh wow! What are you up to?
Okay, have a fun time with all of that!
Let me know if you want to meet later!
Otherwise I can pick you up at 8:30!
Did you want to work out with me too?
Okay great!. Text me when you are ready!
Wanted to make sure you were awake!
Ready?
Okay!. I'll be coming for you...

Ah, leaving now so so so sorry. Here !. I love you!!. Thank you so so much for making my bed!. Sweet dreams!
Good morning!
What time for pickup again?
5:30 is a little close. Oh, just kidding, that should be fine. See you at 5:30!! I will be so ready
You are incredible!! :3. Just have to be there by 10, so it should be fine
5:30 is good as long as we are on time!
Sounds good!
Goodnight! :*
Awake!. Could use like 10 extra minutes. What's your status?
Noooo
Just a tiny bit late (see earlier message)
I'll let you in to bring some stuff dowb
I love you!!!. Coming to McDs?
Please take care of it for me! (: Have a safe drive back!. And fun thrift storing
Yay, that's good! We have 3 more hours!
Not sure yet !. I love you!!!
Hi Peter!. I made it to the house!. Sleeping in the guest room !
Hi Peter!. How was the trip back?
Thank you so so much for getting me to Richmond!
It is called Quality Tire Services 3 on Google maps. On Lucas in Christiansburg. Also, for payment... It will cost $88*4, do you have enough in your account to pay with your card?. I gave you $290 if I recall, so I owe you $352-290. Oh, by the way!! Togepi sold!
Would you be up for shipping it out?
You can keep all the profits!
I'm getting 4, per recommendation of my Mom. Make sure to keep the front left one. And the spare
It is near my nightstand on my dresser!
Did you have fun with Cody? :D. Manual installation isn't necessary!. I was considering wheel alignment, but only if it's included or not so expensive
Just a kiss from you :3
As soon as you can! :*
I love you so so much!!
?!?! :O
(: I will gladly help you demolish that!
Whoops, chest typing. I was leaning over something. .
Haha!. Thank you again for helping me! !
EBay username is pinkfloyd9422. Password is 9mv,afU2. Sleep tight, Peter!
^-^ !! Night night!
Good morning!
Wow, thank you for doing the rest already!!
Bye Peter!. I love you!
Thank you so so much!. I have many smaller in my room if you're ever over there!. Going surfing now (:
I love you!. Oh good!!. I have a scale under my keyboard if you need that!
Ttfn :3
So much fun!
Hi! I'm sorry I've missed your call!!. We went swimming after surfing!. The waves were very good for beginners.
Afterwards, we had dinner at home and then talked with Alec's family
Yeah! They are pretty cool people
How was your day? Thank you again for helping with the errands!. I'm sorry you'll have to go back
Why didn't they leave the front left on instead of the spare?
Wait, how was your day?. Also, why are you worried about me?
Oh, how was it? Which type of gun?
That's super interesting!. Any recoil?
Okay, good!. :3. So why are you worried about me?
The beach?. No need to worry, Peter!. I swam so much today!!!. Like a mile!
In the ocean. I did, but they have some Speedo ones, so I used those
I definitely felt like a better swimmer!  :3. And 2024 Olympics I will be ostrich racing, but not swimming
Oh definitely!  Did you do yours already?. I love you, Peter!!
Nice!! Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too, Peter (:
Get a free trial!
Wow, thank you!
Oh I missed it!
To charlottesville?. How would you get back?
Oh good!! Is that what was making the bump noises going down the road?. So they did replace the rod?
What is a wheel bearing?
Oh, I'm glad it was fixed, thank you!. How long does the tire rod have?
Okay! I really appreciate you getting this done for me! I'm sorry for interfering with your time with Cody!!
Oh good!!. Do I still have cool white rims?
:D Thank you bunches!!
That's alright!
Wow, glad that was found! No, I don't mind paying for it!. Apologies for not taking better care.
No, it won't be necessary!. :3
You are all good!
You're all caught up and more!!!!
:3 Just to have all your dreams come true!! :D. Well... I am looking for my notes from a previous class.. They could either be in the accordion folder on my bedroom floor or... hmm. But if you have other things, it's not the end of the world if I don't have it!. How was the back appointment?. I love you!! :3 My turn for text bombardment
It's not urgent!
What is up for today?. Yard sailing?
Haha, I meant yard sales
I'll try to take some pictures of that too!. Today we are scuba diving and jet skiing!
I bet you'd like surfing too!
I'll have some stories to tell!
I fly on Monday at 5:25am!. How was the back appointment and your say with Cody? Also, that sounds delicious!
Ah, okay!. Good morning! :3
I hope you do too!!. Today we are doing jet skiing and wake boarding and fishing!
I love you too!
Thank you so much for doing that!!
I'll wake up alright!. Thank you!
I sure did not forget about you!! Can't wait to share some stories with you (:
Good morning!
I'm in Georgia waiting to get over to CVille
Just laying on some seats catching some zs!
Ah, no worries!
I'm awake now!. How are you?
I'm doing well! School is really sneaking up on me... starts tomorrow!!
What are you up to?
Oh neat!  What did you do with Cody yesterday?
What sorts of things did you do with him before then?
Wow,  published yet?
I'll look out for it!
?
Don't worry :D
Something you've always wanted to do?
Whatever you like!. Looks like we're taking off soon, so I'll  turn off my phone!  Ttfn!
I love you too, Peter!!! Best of luck with all those cover letters!
Taking some pictures would be awesome!!
Just the first day's lecture! I'll check to make sure it's not here first!
Are you free to video chat in a bit?
Okay!! (:. I'll aim for 16:46 then!. Running a bit late over here. How about you?
Shower is good!
Wow, have you showered already?
I'm ready now!
I thought you would have started with video!
I did, but the conversation just felt forced somehow
I did want to!. Maybe another time
Goodnight!
I will remember!!
Good morning!
Thank you!
^-^. Walking to class, free for call?
No, but I'm wishing I did! Haha, that would be talented phone calling also
Thanks ;)
Yes! Hill and all!
I went out and did some practice!. When you lose an axel nut!
That's fantastic!
Nah, soda tabs are a great temporary option if anything were to happen!
They are so sturdy!! The hole is slightly smaller than the axel, so when you screw it in it stays!
I hope you had a nice day too !
You call the shots!
I'm not tired of you!
I'm fine to talk, just didn't know you wanted to talk more!. Did I miss something?
Whale...
No worries!
What do you mean?
Oh, I'd like to talk! Intermittently with a back and forth is fine, since I'm also working on homeworks!
Thanks!
Later today?
Oh good!
No, just do you!. Thank you though!!
That's thoughtful, but I can manage alright!
Thank you!! Sweet dreams (:
I love you too!!
Nah, It's not a big priority!. You?
Nice!
Cool! Well I'll put it on my list!. Looking forward to playing with yours! Goodnight!
Good morning!
Are you by chance using my eBay account still? I keep getting emails about auctions for broken xboxes and wiis
Maybe it's just a fluke then!
Did you mean tie rods?. I'm about to call Jackie
okay, thanks!. Inner or outer tie rods?
Any other details?
Okay, thanks!. Would you possibly be willing to maybe do more car things next week?. Was trying to get the car this weekend, but I think I should get that fixed and then come and pick it up next weekend.. I will pay you!. Also, please send the receipts for the tires as soon as you can. If you want to get paid back ;P
Do you still remember the total?
So I owe you 161?
Is Venmo okay?
Or I can do Capital One P2P!
Then I"ll just pay you... 161-12 = 149
Anything else you'd like to clear before I send it?
Like other stuff you owe me?. Don't worry, it's not a trick question. You can pay me back at your convenience
I have enough, so I'll pay you the 149 then
Sent!
It would be on Wed or Thursday next week
Jackie's, if you would!
Night!
Good morning!!!. How was your yesterday?
Nice, what did you do?. My day was great!
Oh, are you interested in learning how to skateboard? :D Trick videos?. I went to the gym, 3 classes, did homework/errands, met up with my small group and went to rotunda sing!
I hope yours is too!. I'm currently watching a time management lecture by Randy Pausch!. (YouTube ). I recommend it!
Yes, boyfriend!. Your wristband just came in the mail!. You can register it at musicmidtown.com/wristband. Your ID is 045696222c4981
That's just for the bonus perks!
Perfect!
Oh, where did it end up?
What are you doing today?
Oh, I mean, what was your day like?
What else did you do?. That's not a whole day :P. Anything fun?
Or important?
That sounds like fun! Looking forward to seeing Bear and Bear on the big screen. Definitely watch that Time Management thing.. Hoping you don't actually mean that you're not doing anything that's important to you though!
As long as you're doing the things that are important to you!. Sleep well!
Thank you !
Oh cool! How is it?. Good morning!
Any camera on it?
Nice what is the battery life?. Is it really the one selling for $175 on amazon?
Which lab did you do?
Bitnami?. I was thinking about that one too! Was it useful?
Think you could use it for hosting an app?
Oh sweet!
How did they know you finished?
Oh I see!! Do you take them all at the end?
But you waited til the end and were okay?
:P I'll do it
Which Resource Group did you use?
Just in configuring the Parse VM. I can't lookup Superhuman resource group
bitnami Step 1
5
I can't find it
Oh, so I want to "create new"?. I've been doing existing
Okay, thanks.
Cool! Just submitted!
Thank you!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktlTxC4QG8g. Watch in 2x speed!
I have a lot of random readings/videos for my Algorithms class
What are you doing today?
Ladder climbing?
It's my roommate's birthday tomorrow! I got her a creme brulee!. I'm going to stick a candle in it :P
Creme brulee is really really delicious!. My daily bread has some!. Or is it "Our Daily Bread?"
Goodnight!
Quoting a song?
How was your meeting with a classmate?
What was it like?
Al's Metro Deli? Is that a Radford place? You said "old classmate," so I figured it was someone from highschool!. How was the art?. Or some other work?
Ah, but you graduated so recently!
Somewhere in Blacksburg?
Oh cool! I had no idea there was a graphic design place in Christiansburg.
Did you get to hear about her job life?
Sounds menial!. Wait, wrong word.. Just looked it up, and it means "not requiring knowledge". What I meant, was like.. .tedious. And not super fulfilling. I would say!
By work life though, I meant more like.. what her hours were like, how her co-workers are, and so on.
Eep, that's not good. Well it's just another waypoint to a better job.. Has she been searching, or is she contracted for some time?
Always a pleasure!. Goodnight to you too!
That doesn't sound strange at all!. You said earlier you were missing me.
Just trying hard to tolerate your potential lack of ambitions!. On whether it should continue to concern me, or if it is an indication of your future or something something something.. There are other things too.
Well I know I should be supportive, and that you'll find something sometime in the future.. I know you've got a good work ethic for sure!. It's just tough, and probably even tougher for you.
You're not holding me back from anything.. I'm doing everything I want to be doing.. If you're holding back anyone, it's yourself. Keeping your creativity from the world.... It's criminal
I am. There are rough spots.. There always will be.
But if you're telling me now that you never want to have a job and you're just going to live with your parents for forever, that is definitely not a relationship I want to be in.
But you're just out of college and you're looking for a job, and that's enough.. Anyway, I"m getting to sleep!. Goodnight!
As long as you're doing something, it's fine.. If you're not doing anything, then there's a problem.. Sleep tight!
Good morning!
I hope you did too!!
Great! Pig roast?. How was the flying?
That's great! It sounds like fun!
Goodnight!
I don't think we talk much as it is, so that's probably not the reason for text walls!. Also, good morning!
That's not a good this! I'm sorry that you feel that way.. I mean, that I'm not trying as hard as you?. Or er... What do you recommend I do?
I have all the time!
I mean that I have lots of time for you!
Enjoy!
Thanks!
Sure thing!. How is church today?
Oh goodness, that's definitely not a good memory in the past of American History. I've been at the gym, then doing homework, looking at J term study abroad programs to apply to and now at Fig Skat meeting
No plans for that day yet!
That's pretty cool!! Thanks for thinking of it, but it is pretty far for just a comedy show!. Maybe if it coincided with visiting Leyla
Potentially!. Nice idea!. And The Killers in 2 weeks!!!
Haha, from my Facebook account?. Well, maybe I'll see :P
Tempting...
No worries!
How was your day?
That's great! What did you do?
Sounds like quite a tiring whole day search!!. Oh wait, you mean that's what you did with her. I meant, what did you do today?
Neat!
Haha, my abbreviation!. Well it was something like... Gym, algo readings/videos, J-term Study abroad browsing, Figure Skating meeting, lunch, laundry, homework, grocery shopping, making green smoothies & oatmeal for the week, cooking dinner, more algo videos, eating, and now updating my resume for the Grace Hopper resume database!. And of course skateboarding around between it all!
More like A, B, C, D...!
I'm not so good, but it's great practice!
Are you having fun every day?. You should be having fun at least!
Your days sounds pretty mundane, but you've got no work and no rules to keep you from doing whatever you want to!
So why aren't you doing more crazy things that you won't be able to do once you're stuck in a job?
Whatever you want!. I'd probably be road tripping.. Or learning Folding Chair on piano :P
Or reading all the classics ever.. Don't save anything for me.. Why wouldn't you do the things you want now?. If you save it all for me, then what if I'm gone and you wasted all that time not doing stuff that you could have been doing?. Maybe it's all the TED talks speaking, but I think you need to live a little.
I think you need more of your own experiences!. There will be enough to share with me. I want to learn things from you.. Otherwise you'd never have any stories if you never did anything without me!. Plus if this doesn't work out, then you wouldn't have anything left!. What sorts of poetry have you been reading?
By Goethe?. Interesting, I came across that work earlier today also! What a coincidence.
Thanks! I can't remember exactly what the reference to Goethe was.. Did you like them?
Thanks.
You're not boring.
You're not boring, it just doesn't seem to me like you're pursuing any goals in life, and that you are still developing your sense of self and the things that make you keep going.. I couldn't even describe to someone what sorts of things you want to do in the future. Could you?. I don't feel like I know you very well at all, and maybe that's my fault for not getting to know you.
That's so self-deprecating. Or sarcastic, depending on the tone?. Hopefully sarcastic.
What keeps you getting up in the morning? What's on your mind as you start the day?. What are you working toward?
And what are you doing to get where you want to be?
What did you do this past month relating to that?
And what's the timeline on that task look like?. How long would you be studying animation principles for before you move on to the next task in the list?
And how long before you make anything?. Or get started in the industry?
Ah, I'm sorry for interrogating you, but I seriously think there is something you're missing and that you need to modify your game plan if you want to get where you want to go.. Just assure me that you're not trying, because if you are currently trying hard to make it in animation, well.... Are you totally upset at me right now?. Or how are you feeling?
Pressure can be sometimes good or sometimes bad. Bad pressure would be if you feel like you need to do something to make someone else happy. Good pressure would be if you realize that you don't need to make anyone happy but yourself and are convinced to start thinking about your goals in life and how you can get there.
What's a lot?
Of what?. Words?
What pressure is there? There's no deadline.
What was the deadline?
Is that a way of abruptly ending conversation?
Do you feel like your life is fine the way it is? Or do you feel like you need to change something?. I'm very much trying to life coach you right now, and if you don't need it, then it's very unnecessary.
What's the difference?. :P
Then watch some more TED talks.. Maybe you need to be knocked down before you can get back up.
Your answer to the previous questions?
Do you feel like you need any intervention, or are you okay?
Don't worry about my expectations... I just didn't think you were doing yourself any favors.. But if you feel like you're fine, then you're fine.. It just doesn't sound like you're having much fun day to day.. Are you?
Well what's stopping you? :3
You're your own greatest help too!. Woo, resume completed! Ish...
I'm in the database now!. Okay, time for sleep!. Sweet dreams, Peter!. I love you!
Thank you!!. Good morning!
Thanks!
I'm supposed to call him tomorrow!
Most likely! Do you think you will have a conflict?
Okay, awesome!. By the way, when was your back appointment rescheduled to?
Great!
I hope you did too! I did computer vision homework, went to classes, registered as a TA, did readings, went to more classes, then hosted office hours, modified a course  a bit, and now I'm back home eating miso soup and working on homeworks!. What about you?
Neat! For the whole day?
Yum!. Mmm!! Save some chocolate pudding for me.. :P. Just kidding
I miss you.
Are you still wanting to apply for jobs?
If you start applying now, you'd probably still have a very long time before you'd actually begin work.
You're very fortunate to not have to work.. I guess it's not for everyone!
Working
Actions speak louder than words?
Ah, I'm sorry. I just can't get over that you aren't applying anywhere.. If you don't want a job, it's fine. If you're taking a gap year and know it for certain, that's fine too.. I just don't understand this flux state of not knowing what your plan is.. Like, wanting a job and not doing anything about it.. That's too much.. It's really hard for me to justify for you.. For a while I was just thinking you were slow getting starting, but now school's starting, and before you know it it's going to be Christmas, and that's sort of a long time to not have any plans at all.. .................................. Ah, let me start again... What are you having difficulty with in applying? Do you need any help?. Would you rather take a less traditional approach to jobs and start with freelancing (personally harder in my opinion, because you have to go a seek out customers, but maybe it'd suit you better) ?
Well maybe you shouldn't rely on me, but by all means get help if you need it!
That's awesome!
Sounds like a plan!
Sweet dreams, Peter!
Oh, that would be much improvement over last night dream of monsters!
Don't you worry!
Thank you (: Sleep tight!
Good morning!
I  hope you do too!! And a good appointment!
When is it?
Oh, not for awhile then!
Haha, good one!!. How did it go?
Wow! I'm glad your spine is okay! Was there any sciliosis?. And yes, he said to call him back Thursday, so the car would get fixed on Friday
Friday!. Are you free?
Thanks for the answer!
Thanks for that! I'll keep looking for a ride $. !*
Haven't started, but I was setting up my UVA job profile!

Shared with you!. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FjUYK8jV9Bxtk_zFkAoyaR5hQB24V-jOafHia4Fkry8/edit
Ooh, tricky. Still working on this one :P
This one is a good option!. https://www.amazon.com/Classic-Slackline-50ft-Storage-Booklet/dp/B015EQ46EU/ref=sr_1_2?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1472612968&sr=1-2&keywords=slackline
It's the one I used with Alec, so I know it works, at least!
if (slowPointer == fastPointer) { 			return true; //there was a cycle because the two pointers met! }
Noo, they're just pointers :P
Nah
Well, they can if you want!. Sweet dreams for now (:
Yay!
That's a relief!  Goodnight!
Good morning!
Sweet! Good job!
Thanks!
Yay!! I finally did it!. I didn't look at the answer like I normally do, but I just checked it with my answer, and mine was mostly correct!. (Just had to add an absolute value). if (Math.abs(calcHeight(current.left) - calcHeight(current.right)) > 1) {
I might do another one just for fun!
Haha :P
Oh no, don't take it personally!
Ah no, I thought it was a real claim and I didn't know what to say!
:O. Heading to sleep now!. Sleep tight!
Good morning!. My drone came today!
How was yesterday's workout?
Just keep going ^-^. Answer
That might be useful! I'll be arriving at noon tomorrow though, so I could help drive!. noonish. noon:thirty. I'm calling Jackie at 3:30pm today, so I'll let you know what he says
On your resume, you should spell out what "Addy" award stands for
"American Advertising Awards" It think it could be helpful if you list different projects as expere. projects as experience in a format like...  "Frosty Parrot                                      date        < description > Radford Theatre Department              date         < description >. But I'm not sure if it will help or not. I guess you could keep apply with your current resume, but if you don't get good results, then try switching it up. keep applying. How many applications do you have out so far?
Okay good! Keep it up!. :3
I'm bringing it over at 1:30pm tomorrow
No, I've got it!. Unless you want to go to Jackie's
Did you want to go to the skatepark with me?
Only if you want to!
I was thinking tomorrow before/after Jackie's!
Whichever one works better
Nope!
Ohh, I forgot about that!
Nah, I'm okay without pudding!
Well if you've already made it, I would definitely love to have some!
Probably the same :P
I'm looking forward to that dark chocolate you got me!. Would you possibly be able to give me a ride to my house tomorrow?
From your house hopefully!
Okay, I hope so!!. :3
noon:thirty!
Grrr, I miss you
This kid is so cool:
It's just an expression :P
How was your day?
My day was okay too.
That's great! Which puppets did you do?
Popsicle Sticks that are painted to look like tin?. Also, I've finished my coding problem of the day.
Are you planning to use it in a stop motion?
Why not just photoshop the legs in then?
It is fishy.. And okay.. I'm off to sleep now!. Sweet dreams to you!
It's finished, but I knew how to do it before I started coding.. I'll see you tomorrow!
I'll be there more at noon!
Hi! I made it back. I need your help though!. Plz help. I'm at my house, but I need a spare key to get in. Do you still have one?
Yay, thanks! With the key?
Nothing I can think of!
Good morning!!!!!
Yeah!. I slept well! How did you sleep?
I'm hanging with my Mom right now, so more like 12:20?
12:20 is good!
It works!
Here?
:o
Oh no!!
That sounds good!
To hopefully change your viewpoint! https://www.thetrace.org/2015/09/gun-laws-work-criminals-effectiveness-research/
That's only one source though, so you'd probably need to see 5-10 more before forming a stance. On both sides, of course.
No thank you! I'm not a big fan of going to the theatre!
Thanks for asking though!
Not sure what tone that's in, but it sounds pretty harsh.. No hard feelings, right?
Well thanks for trying, then!. I'm sorry to have hurt you.
I agree
That's the wrong conclusion to make.
No, devaluing yourself isn't the conclusion. You're definitely worth the effort.
I'm just not sure what activities to do. I'm also pretty terrible for wanting to punch you.
No. But I've definitely punched you in one of my dreams before. Sorry :o
Really? :D!. That sounds like fun
Just sparring is fine!
Tomorrow?
That would be nice! But the mosquitoes will be out to play soon.
Yum, that sounds great!
Yum!. 7 o'clock is fine!
See you then!
I'm sorry to make you feel terrible!. I hope you slept well.,
No, It's my bad, I shouldn't have continued.. Also, good morning!
Thanks! I definitely want to see you!
I'm ready anytime!
Dropping things off at Goodwill doesn't take so long!
I want to spend more time with you
Yes, that would be super awesome!
The sooner the better!. Right now, even
Oh hi. What is this feature?
Neat!
Rawr
Okay!
Good morning!. Is this bright and early? :P
Prismacolor markers?. Spare drone parts?
Just for coloring a thank you card!
Colored pencils are fine! I don't want to spend that long on it!
Just pencils are fine! I have paper!
No. Made it to class!
I love you too!!!
It's 6330. 6339. **
Oh thanks!!. Sleep tight!. Please give me a free pass on coding problems today! I'll do 10! tomorrow. Night night
Good morning!! I love you!
^-^. Thank you for transferring me the money, by the way!!! Super helpful
I hope you do too!!
I did!. It's in Charlottesville, though!
Upright Citizens Brigade?
Totally!
Does that mean you're interested in seeing some comedy?
Neat! Do you need me to book you a place to stay?

Neat!. Shall I go ahead and book for you then?. The other option is the living room couch!. Another option might be to ask the girl living in the study room (she is studying abroad), if I can sublet for the weekend.. What do you think?
All to myself? :3
Eeep, decisions
Me too, but money!. That quad copter will help!
$$. :P
Booked!
Poe?
Oh cool!. Wow, so I'll see you on Friday?
???
Yay!. You better come :3

Might think of something later!. Night ^-^
That's the tiniest skateboard ever!. Looking forward to watch that TED talk too!!!. Good morning (:
Where did it come from?
Wow!!!
What else do you have in your garage?
Wow wow!
We're planning to use unity!
Is that with no restrictions on game selling?. Band of Horses is fantastic!!. If you could keep a list of the musical choices we made, that would be great!
You're good! (:
My day was great!. I made new friends!. How was your day?. http://www.thepennyhoarder.com/best-internet-freebies/. I found the almond butter!
I can give this one to you!
Wow, thank you!. Also thank you for being willing to take my car tomorrow to be fixed!. RAWR. Is there a referral link you can send me for Thrive. ?*
Oh, I gotcha :P. Was it that hard to cancel?
Wows
boolean[] strChars = new boolean[256];. Done!. That's neat! Are you looking at doing some game design?. How much time did it take you to cancel Thrive?
Quantifiable?. 30 minutes?
Soo... an hour?. :P
Ah okay!. No custom email?. Just check a box?
Neat
That sounds good! You should do it!
Action is key!. What did you do today?
'O'
I'm going to get on to sleep now!!
I've been doing an awesome job at waking up at 6am!. Ooh, what's on your agenda?
I will think about it!
Just essentials is good!
Yup yup!. Sleep tight (:
Good morning!

Wow, I can't wait to try them out!
Whoa, options!
Thanks (:
Is it still in progress?
Oh good!!
I love you too!!

Just be sure you are able to jump around in a moonbounce!
You'll be okay (:. Sleep tight!

Eta?. I can get it next week; it's not essential!
Sweet! I'll try and shower before then, but feel free to stop for gas in Charlottesville on the way in, if you need some!. Yes, definitely stop for gas :P

You should find parking!
As close as you can

Oh good!. Who knows how long for...
Dun dun dun
Done with today's coding problem! (:. Time for sleep... I'll miss you!!
Sweet dreams, Peter!
I love you too, Peter!!. Rawr!!!!!!!!!!
Yay, you!
Noo, you're still cool!. Does anyone in your family have a Citi card?
Do you think you can register your wristband with my Citicard?. http://www.musicmidtown.com/activities/. You get special perks at the festival
Yes!. You can edit it online. I think you have the wristbands and codes. Yours is the one that hasn't been shortened. (I accidentially tightened mine a little)
I don't mind if you use mine, but I guess it couldn't hurt!
Okay, neat!. Also, do you have access to that fanny pack?. For the weekend?
Awesomeness!!. !! :3
Haha, I get it...
Other ideas for a computer vision project?. Here's some examples.... https://tylko.com/journal/ar/. http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4670/2010fa/projects/final/#ideas. I'm still wanting to do a mobile app type thing!
I've seen that one before! Not sure how helpful it would be though. Definitely doesn't cover most ideas :P so many possiblilities. Thanks for helping
We decided on an attendance checker or calorie counter/recipe generator. (similar to what you suggested)
Yup!. I'm teaming with my co-TA
Oh, it might be about the Nissan!
Hey, I miss you!
:3. ^-^. Well I am so looking forward to Friday then!!
:3
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too, Peter!! (:. ^~^. Sleep tight!
Haha, that sure is weird
You're  cute!
I hope you have a great day too!. I won the Starbucks gift card! Thanks for your help (:
Ahh, so cute!
Yum
My day is going well, though very busy!! How is your day going?
Nah, no free pass on the coding! I wanna be the very best :D. Ooh, does that mean you want to be an animator instead of a video game maker? :DD!!!
2d?
Yay!!!
It's never too late to learn if you are passionate about it!
Thank you!
You can definitely use mine!
What time would you like to leave tomorrow?
I was thinking 7am, but that still wouldn't get us there until 3pm, but we could do one or two activities that we really want to do!
Maybe.... By the way, could you look into the cost / time of taking MARTA park and ride vs parking at a private garage near Piedmont park and walking?
So just $2 a day for MARTA? That sounds great! It's within walking distance of the park?. Or just $2 total?. We can do that then :D
Sounds good
Okay, cool!
Great!
Did you want to make the call?
I mean, Did you want to go ahead and decide for us?. /plan it out!. Sounds like you know what's up
Yup yup!. Also, what is the fare for 2 people both ways?. We should definitely use a close private garage on Sunday, because it will take longer to take the bus back.
+ bus cards? Or are those not necessary
Might just be easier to park in a private garage both days
I will!!
I bet your sister is excited for Beauty and the Beast!
Hermione!
You have wrist bands right?
Just checking!
Thanks!
Made it home! Might have to leave slightly later in the morning!
I'm okay with packing! I had just planned to prepare some ahead of time food for the road trip, and have an assignment to finish tonight!
My mom made lots of food for us!
No, just get to sleep please!!!!. I'll pick you up at 9am! Good night!
The wristbands!
Oh yes!
No.. Go to sleep!. :P
Ready for the road? (:
I think we've got it all!
Got it!. Could you bring us 4 bottled waters for the 2 concert days?
Oh good!!. Did you eat breakfast?
Enough?
I'll bring yogurt!
Bring sunglasses!. And nah!
Yes! I have enough data for this trip
I am trying to download some audio book files
Yup you could!
I got it!
Finally on the way! Sorry for the delay. Do you have a long USB charging cord?
Made it to CVille!. Thank you again for driving!!. I heard about 4 songs on the radio that we heard at Music Midtown! Super cool!
Ahh, meatloaf!!. Oh, don't worry!! I'll catchup eventually!!
Fantastic! $. ! $*. !!*
Yip!
The umbrella is great!!!. Looking forward to sleeping :P
I love you too! !!!
Mine is still on :P. Cool, I just slipped it off!. I could totally get out of handcuffs in the future
Hmm
Aw man, I didn't know you were looking for help!. I thought we were just chatting
Cutting it seems reasonable!
Break the plastic then.. ?*
:O. I gotta go home and sleep. You can have mine if you want!
Just cut yours :P
Good night!
?. Sweet dreams!
Thank you! <3. No ideas yet! What about you?
Good morning ! Yup!! What about you?
That's great!! What's up for you today?
I am studying for a quiz, going to class, updating my resume, going to the career fair, more class, dinner with my sister and then homework and applying to jobs!!. Figure skating was very fun this morning!
Thank you!! we're going to poke!
Kelsie*. Haha, that would be cool
What should my resume tagline be?
Leandra Irvine - "Adventurer & _____"
That's not me :P
Not good for resume :P. Solution Builder or Tech Builder?
So spiffy!. Off to the fair!
!! You approve?
I'm glad you like it!
You mean grape? :J
So good!
Just the salmon!. Yum!!
True true. :P
She's good! I'm staying at her hotel overnight!
I'm applying to jobs still, and then will come homework!
:P More like first!. Urgent and Important. But nice reference
Ah, perhaps
That's great!
Sweet!. I just applied to Facebook!. And Microsoft!. Next is Google
Then.. Airbnb
:O
Aw man! At least they got back to you!. Otherwise you would just be wondering.
Applied to Google!. Slow progress
http://www.katielovesairbnb.com/. http://www.nina4airbnb.com/. Some tough competition there!
Dun dun dun
Hey
nina4airbnb is much cooler!. Viral producing content
And the blueprints to wreak your own havoc!. Virality sounds like fun. That's my second quadrant activity. :P
oooo. Neat!. Sweet dreams for now, Peter!
Conversation is nice!. Goodnight :3
It's a good one!
Maybe both.. But...!. What are you doing this weekend?
No plans either!
I was wondering if you would want to go trail riding this weekend perhaps!. There is the groupon my mom got....
I'll think about it more tomorrow :P
....!. Perhaps
Is it okay if I use you as a rubber duck?. I'm just brainstorming here...
I'm writing a short paper about how "configuring the user" can be harmful. Oh yay!
Here's what it means to configure the user:. Basically, the people who make technology have an imagined user in mind, so they design activities that cater to certain users and define the users actions.. I want to focus on configuring the user in video games.
My first argument is that configuring the user as a male has been harmful to women, because it has lead to a consequential creation of the sterotypical male computer geek, and therefore a decreasing interest for females in computer science. led*. My second argument might be the portrayal of violence in video games.... JK, that's not really an example of targeting a user.... Well... Maybe they are trying to target males, therefore, portraying violence
But then this is harmful because it perpetuates the trait of agressiveness and violence in males?
And leads males to believe that they should act a certain way?
A that it is improper to be less aggressive/dominant?. and*. Unfair to women or men?
What is the harmful effect on women?
I mean.. concretely. Why does it make them sad?
Isn't all violence bad though? When would limiting violence in women be a problem?
Maybe not violence, but aggression? It might perpetuate submissiveness of women. I'll figure something out! I better get writing.. due at 5pm!
Thank you!. I think two supporting claims is good enough to prove my point!. :P. 1. Designing games for males =fewer female players = fewer women in Tech 2. Designing games for males = violence & more male characters = harmful gender stereotypes
Thank you so much!!! ^-^. What's another way of wording that "Video games have been long known to be male-dominated". Or something like that... Video games are male-dominated.... But better sounding. And maybe switching the order up
Thanks!!
I'll just use the first statement I made as a stand in!. for now
http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed. This article had a really clear history of it
Not according to the article I sent. There was never a notion of an "ideal user". The marketing even showed female players. It just attracted more males because the people who designed the games were males.. (So they unconciously put more male-liked things in the games)
1980s*
Meh, details
Woo, halfway done!. Some target females, some males, some families
No need to pursue the truth! There seemed to be enough evidence of gender neutral games at the onset of the industry.
Did you read the article? It was quite convincing. Especially the quotes
Ouch
Finished. !. It's pretty generic!. No need to read it, but it's there!
That's cool!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjsAk2y9ZQ. Super Mario Bros the movie
No :P
Still going strong!
:O
Right right!
Good night!
Hello!
I'm doing well!! How are you?

I love you!!
Hello!! Are you awake?. Want to go to the VT Tailgate with me?. Rawr!
Yay!!!!. You awakeee!
Would you like to go with me to the tailgate?. No problem, I'm sorry to disrupt you!
Now! :P
Come with me... :3. I think there is parking, but if not, we could walk from your house!
Hmm..... I could skateboard to your house. Haha :P. I'm guessing your car is blocked in?
Yay, let's go!. Should I try and drive over to park first, or you you think it's definitely no parking?
I will skateboard over $. !*. Want to go to Cafe Me Kong with my mom and her friend afterwards at noon?
Aw man, you're right
How easy is parking for you?
Yay!. So, should I head over now?. !!!
Oh yay!
Thank you so much for tucking me in!
You're great  ^-^
What are you up to now?
Hehe, playing minecraft, by chance? How long is the chili and cornbread event?
When does church conclude?
Neat!. Are you all ready, already?
No, I just wanted to hang with you!. Let me know when you are ready!
Yup!
Rawr!!!!. Can I come over yet?
Yay!. Be there soon!. Where to park?
Okay!
Here!. Hello!. I'll let you know when I am on the way!. I'm going to skip picking up the food since I'm running late and have enough food until fall break. Are you able to store it? Thank you so much for all the cuddles and larabars!
Thanks!
How would you feel about helping to make a splash screen shatterproof games?. It's basically a little animation
Oh thanks!
Something cute!. :P Well maybe something involving a blacksmith theme, since previous name iterations were based on that
Sounds good!
I haven't check with them yet!. checked *
What are the options? I like the feel of ninja kiwis splash screen
Vector, then!. How was your day today?
My day was great!!. Preview of the art?
Let's see em :D. Wow, I didn't know Kb had a YouTube channel!  Looks like it's just a spoof of Cody's though. What else did you do today?
Oh cool!. Didja catch my other question?
Sweet! Local jobs?
Cool cool!. I'm headed to sleep, so sweet dreams to you!
I love you too!. Thank you for this umbrella!
! I'll save any future coupons!
What are you doing today?
Oh cool. May I have the pleasure of another preview?
Those are all the details I have! The rest is in your hands, if you so desire.. What other stuff have you been working on?
Just living?
Good times?
No. I was just trying to gauge your happiness levels, I guess :P. My inference is a low one, but I should've asked outright.
I'm really good!
I went to the gym, had Bodo's with ACM, had classes, hosted Office hours, more classes, went to Starbucks with a friend, and am now eating dinner and applying to jobs. And next Algo homework!
Reinforcement Learning is cool!
haha!
I hope you had a nice day too!
You're fine!. What do you mean?
That's okay!
How was your day?
Mine was really great!
What did you do today?
Can I eat your cookies?. And truffles?. Hehe. And everything?
Sweet dreams to you too!!!
Hello!. Yum, Indian food soon!
My mom sent your mom a message that she is running late: 12:15
Your mom running late too?
Good plan!. On the way??
If we go, sure!
We might just be walking around!
Yup yup!
Thank you!
I love you too!. Meet me at my house!
Play! Bring pads!
Have fun with your sister!
Oh no D:
:'. Rawr!!!!!!!. Always welcome to come over here til 10:30ish. But you should try to eat dinner first!
Yum!!!. Thanks!
Is it sweet italian? That kind is good top!
Too*
Dude. http://www.misosweetcville.com/. Oh yeah, I remember!
Let's go next time!
It is!. Sweet dreams!
Anytime!. I plan on mostly doing homework and maybe ebay listings tomorrow
If we do, it would be at 7:30am to workout. Did you want to do that?. Might be a bit chilly!
Sounds good!
Thanks! See you then!
Bring a tennis racket if you can find one
Okay, thanks!!. Wearing pants/ hacket?. Jacket*
Cool!
Your laptop and wacom, that way you can do graphic design work!
Or whatever you want to work on !. Cornbread! !. I'm going to hop in the shower!
Think you'd be willing to post ebay listings for me?
Ready anytime!
Deadlines all day!
Nah, you can come over any time!. But let me know if you are...
Sure thing! I am very good at finishing work and can do it no matter the distraction!
You could get a lot of work done too!. If I stay on track, I scheduled a break from 6:30-8:30!
Eat dinner and play fishbowl!
It's a charades type game.. Coming over or not?. Just let me know a time. I was expecting 1pm?
You don't have to come over until 6:30pm if you would rather stick around at home.. Do you have something you can work on?
You won't be alone!. I've got a spot for you next to me.
You didn't do anything wrong, I just felt like you felt weird.. I'm going to go horseback riding tomorrow!
I might just go alone.
What makes you think I don't want to spend time with you?. Thank you for letting me lay on you!
Please come ride horse with me :( . I can get you cheesecake if you come!. Or Pho.... And you don't have to participate in the riding if you don't want to, but I would love company on the car ride at least
!!!!!!. https://www.buzzfeed.com/about/jobs?gh_jid=220561. Can you be ready to leave by 11:20am?
Come hang out with me!. :D
Yup!. Well after you shower, probably. Or something. Maybe I should go get ready too..
Okay!. I should've kept the cornbread here :'
Soo... coming over or pick you up at 11:20?
Okay!. Pick you up now or later?
I do want to see you sooner!
Okay! I'll be there in 2 minutes!
Slowpoke!. Give me a time
No, just let me know when you'll be ready!
Time?
Okay!. Ps, I'm in the front
I'll wait out here with the car!
Nah, unless you think you need more than 10 more minutes
Long pants for horseback riding and tennis shoes (not converse). (Or something comfortable with a heel). Rawr!
Anytime!
Yeah!
Do you have a ride?
I can come pick you up!. Should I go get ready first though?
Should I do exercises before you come over or would you like to join?
Do you want to?
That doesn't matter
Didn't we still do track practice even after days that made us sore?
I'll exercise before you come over then!
I can pick you up around noon after getting ready and we can just do laptop work!
It's okay, it'll be faster and then I'll be more presentable also!
I'm going to go drop my car off to be inspected!. I could pick you up before I do that?. But I wouldn't be able to give you a ride home until after I pick it up.. Is noon still good for you?
Yup yup!
Eep crossing main street now
Well you're welcome back anytime!
Sure!
I'm glad you're safe!
4 frozen meals. How many yogurts are there?. You can bring all of them!
Good night!
Showering now! I'll let you know when I am ready!
Thank you!! I'm packing up now!
Sure! I'll come get you in a bit. Is it cold?
Arrived in CVille!  Thank you so much for everything!
Thanks!! It's going to be fun!!
When was the last time you played ddr?
Have you tested out the Mario dance mat? We could play next time!
It is!
We got it to work, remember?
:D!!. I hope you had a great day too!. I am going to sleep now because sleep is good (:
You sleep well too!!
I think you'd make an awesome workout partner! !. Haha, so distracted :P. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU. And the companion guide:. http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html
Thank you! Those are both great!. We should watch Just my Luck!!. Or did I show you that one already?. :P. It's sort of a similar concept
That Ringling College is doing something right!. Anyway you can get access to their course materials?. There must be some of it online somewhere..
Looks like all undergrads in Animation end up producing one of these cool videos!. Just 2 people too.. that's pretty cool.
You could start one :D!. Just grab a friend who is also an aspiring animator
Or I think I've seen some solo projects too!. LIke that cute doggie eating food. *making food. Oh, that was CalArts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXFldV3ImU0. So good, let's watch it on loop!
We should watch Only Yesterday!. 100% on Rotten Tomatoes!
Sent you an animation opportunity circulating at UVA FMS! If you are interested, e-mail the person saying that it was forwarded to you by your friend at UVA. Definitely send them your portfolio website too!. Oh man, that video is so sad
The one in the email I sent you!
Think you're interested?
No, they just went to FMS to find students. They don't discriminate against talent.. Worst they can do is say no. Say your UVa friend fowarded it to you.. And send them your portfolio!. If you are interested :D. Hmm.. have you illustrated a variety of races before?. Or do you only draw white people?
You should add some more diverse races to your portfolio before you send it tonight!. I think it would really jive with this particular client
But they might not check it yet.... :P
Ah, you're fine :P. It might be good advice for the future though. ^-^ I'm glad you contacted them!!

ooohh, interesting!. :D!. ^-^ *grabs popcorn*
What did he ask?
Oooh, stop motion. :P. Haha, impractical. Maybe CGI, but how? O.O
Do you think you could? :O. I know you like a challenge (;
Eep yes
Your portfolio!
I love you!! Sweet dreams!
Yay (:
Always be clear! :D
Any way you could emulate the style?
Sounds like you'll get some good experience communicating with a client at the very least!. Not sure how much experience he has with animation terms
You may have to take the lead on suggestions! Good thing you asked for more details, maybe you could do some style mockups and let him choose
Ah well don't take my advice too much to heart, soujds likr you have it figured out!. Goodnight!
I love you!
You're fine. He's probably at work
That's alright!!. I hope you're having a great day!
I went to the gym, met with project teams, did homework, played guitar, made enough green smoothies to last forever, am going to meet someone who needs TA help, took a nap, and am going to McCormick Observatory with a friend!. What about you?
That's great!
That makes me feel bad.. :(
It's okay. I'm sorry to make you upset.
I hope you do too!
Goodnight!
We went mainly to listen to our professor's talk!
Thank you! It was fun!
Don't worry, Peter!
I'm not feeling hurt!
Only sometimes
You too!!. Oh hi!!
Yay, you!!. I miss you!. :3
Off to open fields !. Thank you for spending time with me last weekend!
Just was doing homework at rice hall with Sam
It was good! I am nearly finished with all my algorithms problems!. Definitely underestimated how long those would take.. How are you?
Neat! Hopefully it goes well!. Sweet dreams!
Good (:
How is mine craft going? Anything exciting happen in it?
Yay! Now the chickens will be safe.. And cows :3
Everything!
<3
No, I was imagining you hearting Cody's impression
What else do you know?
Probably a lot of things!
Like how relativity works?. Ahh, I'm falling asleep, I'd better go. Goodnight.
Hi! Happy Saturdat!!. Saturday*
How are you today? (:
I'm really good!!
Working on the attendance checker app, studying for machine learning and eating at the 5 Star dining hall (Runk) & DDR!. And a fun game where you crash into other cars to get points :P
Thank you !! What is in store for you today?
Whoa :O. That's crazy talk.
Still applying to places?. Have you already hit up Google, Microsoft, Facebook? :P
Do it!!. They all have designer/ux roles for university grads I bet. Same with any other Web facing company
Sometimes it's fun just to apply places. (Only if you'd want the job) But I feel like you can't go wrong with those ones especially as resume builders. All they require is resume/transcript so it's super easy
Yup yup!
Apply everywhere! The world is your oyster!. They have a spot for personal website
Awesome! Do you know where you'll be around 5:35pm today?
Oh whoops, I meant to send that to James cause I am giving him a ride to Runk
I'll be in town next weekend! (:
For seeing you!
What are you up to today?. Your first assignment! http://www.animationmentor.com/animation-program/body-mechanics/#body-mechanics. Come with me :D! https://www.facebook.com/hokiebugfest. I will conquer my fear of spiders
Does your church have any fun fall festivities coming up?. Hayride? :O
:3 I like spending time with you!!
Maybe we can work on Halloween costumes this weekend!
Hmm.... It would be fun to be a ninja
Aw, why?. Like Sheik. Then you could be link. Link*
What do you want to dress as?
Not necessarily, but being a ninja is fun! ! Which Studio Ghibli costumes?
Ninja :O!
Time to break out your tights...
Hmm, Robin, Peter Pan, and Link all look quite similar
What do you want to be?
:D. So that's the plan?. We can pick up fabrics and such this weekend and break out the sewing machine!
Oh yeah!
Lots of fabrics. Can't wait!
Now I just gotta work on my ninja skills!
:D We can play zelda games!
Can you play as Sheik in any of the Wii games?. Maybe Smash Bros. We can fight!
O.O!. We must play. Does Gap still have it?
Ooh, with who?
So fun!!. How long for and which island? I'm planning a trip there soon!. Maybe you can get their itinerary for activity ideas. Or any recommendations
There are some fun places to explore in Hawaii!. Oh cool!
Can you play as Sheik?
They should make a game like that!
Is Sheik just Zelda dressed up?
Ohh!
That would be nice! I just want it to look nice!
Okay!. Are you free to talk right now?
Oh good!
You know what's crazy?
Professor Muir won't be teaching anymore because he commented on social media that Black Lives Matter is a racist organization, and the University wasn't pleased.. But it's crazy because BlackLivesMatter is actually racist by definition.
Here's their platform if you are interested in deciding for yourself: https://policy.m4bl.org/platform/. But I think its so silly that people can't have strong opinions and keep their job.. Does being in a high position mean that you should hide your political beliefs?. Like, if you were the CEO of some big company?
Do you think Black Lives Matter is okay?
No. I bet if he voiced his opinion differently, it would have gone over alright.. I'm sure he was just intoxicated or something and didn't even intend to post something like that since I know he is a pretty smart guy.. "smart" as in business smart
Maybe someone was trying to frame him :O
Right?! It's a possibility.... If you leave it sitting open on your computer... things could happen.
I guess the lesson is that social media can definitely ruin your life. Gotta be careful about what you say!. I've seen much worse on Facebook, but I guess those people don't have reputations to protect.
Haha :P Smart!
http://theeternalouroboros.tumblr.com/page/10. This person has a pretty good guide towards the bottom. As a rough guideline-- it's awesome looking, but always room for improvement!. This has some cool details: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/74/61/29/74612911f6218f358d97a8c389368924.jpg
It'd be neat to have the back like that too
I'd want it to look more less costume-y and more like something I could wear for being a ninja!. So I'm going to avoid using paper much!. at all*
Will the paint come out nicely?
Come out looking nice?
Did you see the costume guide?. Super detailed
http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/7/7b/Sheik_(Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl).png/revision/latest?cb=20090611205752. I think it was based off this picture
Nah, just "gauzy stretchy fabric". I think there is some at Joannes. Joanns*
I'd probably go black on the cotton cord. Black leggings and the shirt should be easy. Black leather and grey leather are okay to find too. How is link looking?
http://jillid.deviantart.com/art/Sheik-Legend-of-Zelda-310690881. Maybe the turban could be sewn into a "hat" to make it really easy to put on
Coolest Link I have seen so far! http://amouranth.tumblr.com/post/34331972339/thanks-so-much-for-the-awesome-feedback-everyone
http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hypebeast-wordpress/image/2016/02/legend-of-zelda-turns-30-0.jpg. Also, blue Link?
I mean the newest Zelda game!
Whoa :O. I better get to sleep!
You sleep well too!!. Rawr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yay, so excited to make costumes!. Not sure how to do that edging on the arm armour. And the quilt patterns on the leg armor will be tough
Okay! (:. Would you mind helping me do the painting on the fabric? I bet you could get the edges looking really clean
Good idea!
Haha, did you do it already?
Great!
You could probably get away with something like this: https://www.etsy.com/listing/285367641/gold-on-mocha-metallic-lycra-spandex-58?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_d-craft_supplies_and_tools-fabric&utm_custom1=6e7765d7-ceb1-4f50-b044-657bd0482154&gclid=CIim9aSUzs8CFQNZhgodPAMEBg
I saw Kelsie!!!! :O
I hope you have a nice day today too!!. What are you doing today?
Oh cool!!. Also.. please take my money!! ;P. "	  Your Person2Person payment to pmattox2@radford.edu for $30.00 has expired because the recipient didn't respond in time. We've canceled the payment and returned the money to your account."
http://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/1488-Animating-Advanced-Body-Mechanics-in-Maya. Try the "free trial" for this site if that module looks good!!
It's for food from Kroger and the pharmacy item
Rawr!
Take this: http://www.5lovelanguages.com/
Yup yup!. Curious what you will get :P
Just email. Who knows what they will do with it. You can put a fake if you want
Just heard housemates talking about it!. Sure! What's yours?
Your Scores  12	Quality Time 9	Acts of Service 5	Words of Affirmation 4	Receiving Gifts 0	Physical Touch   In retrospect though, I'd probably shun all the gift giving questions and allocate those to physical touch instead.
You have lots more physical touch than I do though.
Oh interesting!. Thanks for taking that
Nah!
So unconventional! :O What will happen next?
Maybe a little. *hug*
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!!. Getting to sleep early tonight? :O
Oh yes ^-^. Have some Sheik training to do!
Eh?. Oh yeah :P
You can be Link without an ocarina!
Where would you have room to carry it?
Haha :P Good one. Sweet dreams to you!! :3. I love you!
!! Good morning!. Aw, I miss you :(
:3
Oh cool!. Yup, UVa does have lots of things!. Will you accompany me to the Avett Brothers concert on October 30th?
:D! Yay
No, just regular clothes!. I cooked a yummy butternut squash, shrimp, and broccoli dish yesterday! :D
How are you?
I'm good!!. The day is like a basket of daises ^-^. And also cold.. And skatingboarding in boots is weird
skateboarding*
Will you go outside?
Time for sweaters!
Did you hear how the Energizer Bunny got arrested?
He was charged with battery
:P
There's more where that came from...
Even without any cheesecake involved?
No, it just seems like a good thing to have while listening to bad puns
Hi Handsome! What are you up to?
I'm learning how to make an algorithm to distinguish faces!
What is the tutorial about?
Oh cool!
Awesome! Do you think we have what it takes to make it?
Hooray!!. Hooray!! I have an interview with my favorite company :3
Oh, thank you :*3
Oh good!!. Sweet dreams!. I love you, Peter!!
Good morning!!
!!! :D. Seeing you soon ^-^
Could you acquire some stiff paper to use for making patterns for the clothes. ?*. Like draw it out and cut it out to see if it fits our body. and then trace that on the fabric
Instead of paper?
It's better if I make the patterns in person and then we get the fabric accordingly! (:. I need to make lots of armour pieces and the corset!
Then the white fabric that we will paint!. But I should be there for the measurement
Before you start painting. Same for scarf, plus, not much to make there
I'm curious whether we can find that "cabaret mesh"
Anything like this available? http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/272255839434?lpid=82&chn=ps&ul_noapp=true
All the hugs!
Oh it's so prompted :O. ^-^
Really meant to!. Sweet dreams to you :3. Looking forward to seeing you!
No suede!. Just thin leather leather. It can even be fake, but I'll see how much I need!. Rawr!!!. What did you do yesterday?
I'm don't need big sheets of leather, just small pieces. And I want the thin stuff :P. Smooth. It will be okay. If you ever have any time management issues, I recommend doing time-tracking -- like writing down what you did during each portion of the day.  It's been super helpful for me because I am always pretty embarrassed when I have to fill in "browsing Facebook" or something as one of the time slots.. Happens a few times yesterday :O. Happened*
Oh goodness. I am thinking way smaller scope and more efficiency focused. I only have one whole day to devote to the actual costume making (and might put off a lot of it to the 29th, if it's looking like it will take more than 5 hours).. I was just going to get something that resembles leather and is thin enough to run through my sewing machine.. The punches might be helpful for running the cotton cord through though!. Or I might just need a big needle for that.
That sounds good!. Is that what we used for your vest?. That worked well for sewing!
ooh
Nope, I'm going to wait til Friday!. Thanks though!. You can go for your stuff though!
Oh, that's fun! Let's go tomorrow night!. Or maybe Friday is better!. Friday!
Good night!
Thank you so much for the gloves! I use them everyday!
Thank you! (: I love you so so much and can't wait to make those costumes!
Oh good!
Yup, I know what type of fabric to use!
Sweet dreams!
Is it bad that whenever you are up this late, I just assume you are playing Minecraft? :P
Is thinking that someone is playing Minecraft equivalent to thinking poorly of that person?. I just remember you stay up pretty late when you play with your friends
Oh no, please don't be so sure!
That's a rough job!
There are many different kinds of grading! I meant the multiple choice/ (one answer) grading is rough because it's super tedious and feels like it should be automated
Ah, that's extra tediousness!. Did you still want to get lunch tomorrow?
Okay! Where and what time?
Chipotle sounds good!
I'm busy from 10-12, so 12:30 would be good for me!
Meeting at the restaurant is fine!
Okay, see you!
Also goodnight !
No, I was going to skateboard over!. Thanks though!
I'll be safe! Chipotle is super close to my house!. I won't even have to enter downtown besides the parking lot!
Okay, I"ll meet you there! 12:30, right?
Awesome, see you then :D
Lots of parking, but it costs the regular fee!. Let me know when you're close, then!
Oh good!
I love you!!!. Sweet dreams!
Hello!!
I slept well!. How about you?
Yup, that might be good! I have other work, but I won't finish in time to have time left to work on the costume
How is 5pm?
Oh, which stores?
I'm not interested in going there!
I was thinking TJ Maxx/Ross and Joanns, maybe goodwill
?. No, you're fine!. I'm of course free whenever, but just doing homework!
Oops! It's here if you need it!
Do you have fabric paints?
Okay! Bring whichever colors you have and we can test them beforewe shot. shop*. Do you have any work you need to finish too?. I like doing my homework with you
Cute porcupine!
5pm is still good!. Don't forget the fabric paints
Ahh, I slept wayyyy too long! Thank you for calling, maybe that is what woke me up :O
:'(
Too cozy!
Gotta get all ready!
Ah, what's my alibi?. I'm going to stick around here and  finish working out/getting ready.
No, you're so famtastic!!
We're working on our costumes today, right?. I do want to see you too, I just feel like I don't have any good reason to go to your house. Did you want to come over though?
Ah, that's great! We can work at your house then! Maybe after Pandapas pond around 5:30ish. But before then, you can come over!
I'm not busy right now
You can come too, if you want!
I think you are! But it won't be til 4pm anyway!. We can play in the playground again!. Oh course I've got homework, but there's time for fun!
Ah, but I really want to see you!!. I thought you did too?
Busy, but enough time for breaks!
Well I like being around you while doing work!
You could do some work too!. Learning maya?. Or learning something. Coding :P
So you don't want to hang out today? :(
My mom's making scrambled eggs--it would be rude to leave at not eat them.
Yay, are you coming over then?
Okay!!!. Please do!. :3. I'm sorry I didn't wake up early enough :(
To come over and cuddles
I didn't feel comfortable leaving once it got too late.. I don't have any good reason to
I wasn't planning to do that until later!
I didn't want to, then
I promise not to be mean if you're taking a long time on a tutorial if you come over and want to do that!
Oh no, what's wrong?. Can I cheer you up with a call? (:. Or make you some yummy food?. Or fold the tinest crane for you?. (With my back? :O)
Bring your papers to grade!
Do you need a ride?
On the way?
Yay!
Ready soon!
Aw, thank you!. Oh hi!  I'm awake!
I made it to CVille safely, by the way!
I didn't, so I'm glad you took the picture!. Thank you so much for everything!
Thanks :D Flight leaves tomorrow, so that's pretty soon!
I hope yours is going well too!
I love you too!!
Sweet dreams (:
Aw (:. So early tomorrow, but I will go!. Some things are more important than sleep!
5:30am xO
I'll be fine!
Thanks though!. :. (:*. Sleep tight!
Figure skating was so much fun this morning!. Ah, Barack Obama gets even cooler!. http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2016/politics/candidates-general-election-matchmaker/. Curious about what answers you would choose!. Some cool skateboards for sale in Blacksburg! https://blacksburg.craigslist.org/search/sss?sort=rel&query=skateboard. Well, there are some better ones in blacksburg!
That's okay!. Oh, I mean your actual responses :P (if you still have them)
That's okay then!
On the way to Housyon!
Thank you!!. Hehe, this plane is full of women in computer science!. So cool!
I love you!  (:
Fantastic
I have advice from Pixar for you!
Can you take a call soon?
http://www.parkablogs.com/content/blogs-of-pixar-artists-and-animators. http://www.pixar.com/careers/Career-FAQs. http://louromano.blogspot.com/
Neat! Sweet dreams!
:P
I love you too!!
It was so much fun!!!
It's a bunch of women dancing with foam light up sticks :P
So fun!
Yes, that was the last party!. Last event*
Oh cool!
I'm on a plane about to take off, but thanks a bunch for the heads up!. Enjoy it :D
Great!. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15066811?checkin=10%2F28%2F2016&checkout=10%2F31%2F2016&guests=2&s=HEHwVLUX
Or there is the couch in my house :P. Did you want to book the airbnb for us?
Beds are more comfy!. Awesome! I can split it with you.
There are other options too, if you want!
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/487795?checkin=10%2F28%2F2016&checkout=10%2F31%2F2016&guests=2&s=EUkDdd2M. Lots of things!
Hmm, definitely the cottage! But it is more expensive
By 33% is a lot!
I like the cottage more!
Til Monday if you don't want to drive through the night!. But you can always stay on my couch the last night if that makes more sense to you!. Maybe it does since I might be doing some group work on Sunday. And you probably won't need to shower on Monday morning
Okay!
What are you working on right now?
That's you?. :O
:(
I thought we just established you are a potato?. potato cat*
Ah, I just meant: What are you doing?. Just another way of saying it
Neat!
Scary
You just book and leave the typical introduction message
add my name, at that I study computer science at UVA. Also add your background (recent graduate at Radford). include that we don't drink/smoke
Sounds fine!. Maybe mention check in/check out time
Probably will check in as early as 3pm, if allowed, and 12 Sunday or earlier!. I planned on hanging in the cottage--not being out most of the time. Maybe do some cooking!. But we won't be there the whole time of course!
Okay!
Is it discover?
Sure!
Not sure, but that works!
Awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing you!
How has your week been?
It was great!
Oh good!
Have fun!
Nope!
^~^
:3 What would you like to do and eat this weekend?
We can always go hiking and to Carter's mountain!. Yes, ramen, too! :D. + donut!. ^-^. See you on Friday!. Eep.. writing a paper! We have to create an argument and then support it with evidence.. I might just mention some of my thoughts here!. Soo.. I want to focus on social media and the election, but I'm not yet sure what my thesis will be.. And possibly algorithms in social media. Maybe social media is an unintended political tool... Some interesting things are that false news propagated through Facebooks trending topics. Maybe something like 'The politics of social media'. It's a unique platform from previous forms of press/media because of the personalization which allows for more targeted content and voter feedback/influence from other voters whereas in previous elections, professional news sources were the main media coverages.. The reading we did explored the idea of technologies being driven by social politics (to further some agenda for changing social order). I could modify that idea and argue that technologies, like social media, can be shaped into political devices. The initial invention of social media, like Facebook, was not likely not intended to be used to help advertisers and politicians broadcast their agendas, but the developers behind Facebook have maintained it so it can be used in this way.. Or maybe the technology itself is not political, since it is not trying to change social order in a set way, but is more like a platform.. Or maybe it is political in that it allows others to change social order through it.. Yeah... that could be something!. Eep, I'll get to sleep and work on it tomorrow. Oh wait, Facebook is totally political in nature because it tries to adapt the concept of friendship to a certain model, thus changing social order.. But its uniquely political in that the content it accepts can forward its own social goals as well.. Yup... i"ll work on it tomorrow!. Sleep tight!. Interviewing with Google from ~1pm-3:15pm!
Thanks!
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!. Could you pick up my costume from my house?
Some more frozen meals!. Ah, it's going to be great to see you!. Sleep tight!
Thank you ^-^. Sweet dreams, handsome!!. (:
I did my first waltz jump today and it was so awesome!. Rawr!
:D Yay, fear of jumping on ice skates slightly gone
Spring semester!
We could go shopping when we're together!
5%, eh?. Are those yogurts still on megasale?
You should call to let her know you are coming and then you have permission to go in my room and find it!
The dress is in my sisters room in the plastic bin near the closet
The headband is on the mirror right when you enter. The messenger bag is somewhere :O
And the broom might be in the HVAC closet. And my mom's red Tom's you will have to ask for
Thank you!!
I love you too!. When is check in on Friday?
Any time at all?. When is the earliest you mentioned?
Okay!
Okay, cool!
I'm 90% sure its there. It might be in my sister's room near her desk or hmm.... Oh yeah, I htink I have it here!. Thanks!
:O
Yum!!. Whoops, I missed your question, but we can always get some things in Cville!. 2 more days! $. !*
Good night!
You too!
Nope!
Up to you!. I'm free to meet you all day! I am working on a project from 11:30am to 1pm, but you are more than welcome to sit in!. How was the miso soup?. Oh, just realized I might want my snorkeling gear here! But I could ask my mom to bring it when she visits next weekend, maybe!
It's on the top shelf of my closet!. :O And maybe it's time to break out the footed tights too.. :P Hehe, no worries, I'll ask my mum to find those for me.
Good question D: ! The black pants are in a paper Kroger bag in my room, and tights might be where you found the Kiki dress, but no worries if you can't get to them!
Oh thank you!! You found it all!. The tights are already opened right?
Yes!
Nope!  Just let me know when to expect you!
And bring warm clothes of course!
9pm
:O!!! Ah, Capital One just confirmed a spot for me in San Francisco if I want!!
Yes!!
Definitely!
Nope!
Yup!
Okay!
If you arrive between 11:30pm-1pm, I won't be there to get you a parking permit though. (Since I have a meeting)
So arrive either before 11:30 or after 1pm. Okay!
Oh you're fine, I just haven't seen these messages yet. Meeting is at Rice, party is tomorrow, 11am is better than 10am, and no dress code for tomorrow!
My potential future office space: https://www.google.com/search?q=capital+one+san+francisco+office !. You can if you want, but I plan to change into mine at the airbnb most likely!. (Make sure you click images)
So cool!. Unless those are just the "cool" offices :P
Anyway, it's super cool! :O. ^-^. Going to CA!. Good night!. I love you!
At Rice! I am also doing interview practice at 1:32pm, so we can get lunch , park your car, and walk back to campus!
Oh good!. At Valley, then!
Yay!. Have a safe drive! Thank you so much for visiting!
Yay, I'm glad you're safe!
:3. When will I see you next?
I'll be in Blacksburg for Thanksgiving weekend and I am free for a trip from Dec 6th-11th
Sweet dreams to you too!
I love you too!!
Have a fantastic day!
Oh good!. Aw, you didn't ask me?
Okay! I'll let you know!
I love you too!. May I commission a graphic from you?. I need it by tomorrow at 1pm.
Okay!. I need a graphic demonstrating social media as a boundary object for my STS presentation.. It will take up one powerpoint slide.
It will display two laptops (or, better, a laptop and a mobile phone) back to back in the center (as the boundary object). It should convey (maybe through a bubble stemming from the devices), that Facebook and/or Twitter/other social media is being used.. On one side of the laptop, I want to represent the citizens who are discontent with their government. Maybe they look like a crowd of protesters (Pictures of Arab spring revolution?) with signs.. The other side should represent the government (probably on the right side). So this would be a group of statesmen/government officials. And one person from each group interacts with the device while the crowd is huddled around them or behind them on their respective side.. Can you picture it?
There would be three text labels at the top (possible to crop out if I decide not to use them or change them).  "Citizens" "Social Media" and "Government"
I like yours too!
The government is viewing, not posting
Not a chat
There's no need to display the output. Just a facebook icon or twitter icon is fine. But I like that take on it. It would be more a group
The first one is better!
I was imagining the same format, but with a table inbetween and two people sitting
Social media is the boundary object. The devices should be back to back. Like this but from the side. They aren't communicating with one another necessaribly. And the onlookers shouldn't look as distracted. I like the protester at the back though
https://www.google.com/search?q=boundary+objects&espv=2&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS653CL653&biw=1366&bih=638&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUmPCZmInQAhUY0IMKHYL4BycQ_AUIBigB
Could you make the chairs a lot close together?. Yup yup!. And there should be lots of bubbles with different social media logos
Just in the center where we are representing social media visually. It's one big metaphor. Thank you so much
Yeah! And the bubbles can be shorter (just big enough to fit logo). Actually, maybe your way is better
Try with squares and see how that looks too. Any style is fine as long as it displays social media as the boundary object that both citizens and governments interact with. Weibo in China is one I am looking at (for another logo). I described the protestors/gov' earlier.. Also, if you just do gender/race neutral figures that is fine.. On one side of the laptop, I want to represent the citizens who are discontent with their government. Maybe they look like a crowd of protesters (Pictures of Arab spring revolution?) with signs.
No labels needed, I'll just add text later. But I was just imagining xkcd style labels. (Super plain). At the top
Government people will most likely be wearing suits. Maybe look up examples of different  government officials (like China and Egypt). Race/gender neutral is safest
They are just in suits mostly. (http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/mbdresplarge/mritems/images/2014/6/17/20146175250342734_20.jpg). Maybe some hat/badges on one. Not xckd for the whole thing, just the label font?. But however you do it is fine!!
Thank you!. Sounds good!
Thank you!. Is $15 okay?
Okay!. Thanks!
Does not matter which way it goes!. I just wanted to show both types of devices
Thank you!!
Either would be good!!. http://giphy.com/gifs/10-principles-of-motion-design-3oriOiLUqWXA9Rc7eM
?. Static image is fine!
Oh hmm!. Might be distracting if it loops, but just one cycle could work
Sweet dreams!
Good morning!
Awesome!. Make sure the contrast between left and right side is clear
Yes, that the two groups are separate
Oh good. Thank you again!
email? Thanks!. Nice, that's pretty good, but needs some crowd on either side behind each of the chairs. And less symmetry between the standers by the chair. (but I know you said it's temporary!)
No, just different poses. Both don't even have to be holding the chair
Thanks. I was going to put it on a white background. could you change the sign color?
Thank you!. Looks great!
:O
It's true!. Thanks again for doing the graphic on such short notice. I think it went over well!
Could you send the script in a pdf through email?. It's hard to open!
Yeah! Pdfs are the future
A flashback within a flashback!! How daring!. I like it
I can voice older Lily
The script is fine. Might do some improv takes if I deem it necessary to suit my speaking style (to an extent)
Size 7.5. I think 38 cm, but I can't remember
24.5cm
Yes. I think I like the look of the z amuri better (It's like my Tevas) :P
I'll take a look tomorrow!
Goodnight!
Okay!. Is it okay if they are low quality?
Okay! I'll send you test runs first
Ah, true. The voices should be recorded in conversation style
:D Hooray, the Cubs won :P. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vUEKQQm-rY
But the back to future coincidence (almost) is too cool
I hope you had a nice day too!
Yes, I'm feeling better! Goodnight!
I miss you too! I keep busy though so it doesn't set in as much!
What is the deadline?
I can do it tomorrow, but not anything high quality
Really now?. That's easy then. Also, there's a lot you can do before getting the voices. Like storyboarding!. How's it looking os far?
Nice! Can't wait to see it
Have fun1. !*
It's a joy
Goodnight!. How are you feeling?
I'm good!!. Would you prefer separate audio file for each line, or is one big file okay?. I can do separate if you would just end up cutting them all down anyway. What's the best format for your usage?
Do a mock up in your animation software and see if mp3 works. Mp3 is much easier for me!
Okay!
No problem! What should I title them?. The first few words of the line I'm saying seemed good to me. Or just numerically
Numerically then!
No problem!. Don't thank me yet :P
Goodnight!
^-^
:3
^~^
Happy Saturday!
I'm hanging with my Mom right now!
Oh neat!
Goodnight!
Thank you! ^-^
Thanks for the reminder!. I'm looking forward to brighter mornings!
Thank you! You too!. How are you doing today?
Oh, what are you sketching? I'm doing well!
Neat!
I'm doing well! Spending some time with my mom and then working on homework, a midterm and projects!
Yes, we ate at Monsoon Siam,  which had good Thai food!
Aww, cute! Thank you!
Everything is good, thanks!
Yup!
I love you too!
Goodnight!
Thank you!
Me too. Good night!
I love you too, Peter!. Spikey!
How were the polls?
Have a good time!
Me too! (Cryptic picture ). I did multiple takes of each thing and even got a real sneeze recorded in case you need it!. Hope it's not too complicated
No, I was just sneezing and thought it might be useful for something
No payment necessary!
No payment needed!. The hugs would be because you want to hopefully (:
:D
That's funny, I just got off mine
Goodnight!
Thanks! I hope you did too!
You too!
Thanks for letting me know, Peter! Yup, we did have a breakdancing show, but I didn't dance in this one. I did not master the Ollie yet, and the paper was good!
Sure thing!
Nope!
I definitely have time!
I think I was mainly waiting for you to initiate some conversation.. So thanks for doing that. I feel like we don't really talk much, and I am more likely to have more in-depth conversations with other people.. I also struggle to come up with things to ask you about. I was asking for a while, but it just seemed like the same few things and it's hard to figure out what to ask.. Also thought you would like me to stop bothering you about whether you are doing this or that with your free time.. I think it's just a general being "used-to" not talking much, and none of those reasons really substantiate it on their own.. We never really have talked much anyway...
Maybe we don't need conversation?. I can go to other people for that!
Good company!. To be fair, I think you were doing a pretty good job there (ish), but then you followed up with a worried comment. I think that is usually how it goes in the past too.
I think it's just a bunch of habits that need breaking.. With other people, it's so easy, but I feel like it should be easier with you because I know you better. And now there's probably too much to expect/worry about. There's just no winning...
?
You don't have to know what I want to talk about, because I don't know what I want to talk about either. You just ask things and say things.. (how confusing was that :P?)
What If is the best ^-^. Eep. IF I. Mixed it up with the xkcd book I"m reading
Book book with comics among the dense words. dense paragraphs*. But it's entertaining
It's a bunch of Q&A. My favorite one so far is probably.... Can you make a machine gun jet pack?. (Spoiler:. Permission to spoiler?)
You can!
It's going well!. Right now I'm in a "collection" phase, where I record random melodies or lyrics that come to mind.
I'm afraid some of them I might be getting for somewhere. Maybe there is a program that detects song similarity. getting them from somewhere*
Oh yeah, I've seen that.
What have you been doing the past week?
Which illustrations?. Also that sounds like fun! Fakie 180 or something else?
I've been doing lots of classes and paper writing and family weekend and the usual other things!
Oh, you mean a kickturn!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmdaovBNms
Oh good!. Maybe?
That would be great!
Good night!
I'm hope it is put to good use!
Certainly!
What are you doing right now?
Neat!
Interesting conclusion!. https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=us+election+results
That's okay.. It's easy to find similarities if you try
Hopefully they change when I wake up!. Interesting that we can get live results!
Down to the number of people :O
Haha, DC votes 93% Hillary. Looks like Trump wouldn't be welcome if he moves in
Well sweet dreams!
Oh no Trump won? ?!! And both the house and Senate are republican? ?
That's okay! Maybe it will bring everyone closer together.... Misery loves company?
P.s., what do you think about global warming?
Do you think we should try and fix it?
I think it is one of the most impending problems affecting humankind and we should definitely be making big changes to help. ( not producing as much food, especially beef, could help a lot! )
I was surprised that 30% of Americans don't think climate change exists!. (In a subsample poll)
Oh, I haven't seen it! Link? Solar energy has hidden costs like manufacturing that often reduce its overall imapact. And usage would not be widespread unless subsidized by the government
Also, you need a lot a lot of solar panels to sustain any lifestyle. in the US. Like A LOT A LOT
Not consumer friendly as in less expensive though. He's just targeting less than 10% of Americans I would say. But you do have to start somewhere...
I think lifestyle changes would be the most effective. Reducing power/water usage overall.... And easy to implement right away.. But those movements have been around since Who Knows When
Any luck finding an animation community on Facebook?
https://www.facebook.com/groups/22713306769/?ref=br_rs
https://www.facebook.com/groups/NYCMotionGraphics/?ref=br_rs. It's just a community?. Are you referencing the work posted by members of the community?. https://www.facebook.com/groups/309128139288328/?ref=br_rs. The last one might be more your style then. There are so many out there
It's good to have connections with people who share your interests
Or if you can't find one you like, you can always start one. !
Are there really no communities for apsiring animatiors/stop motion artists?
Reddit?. http://www.animatedbuzz.com/ ?
I bet this one would be pretty good :O https://www.facebook.com/groups/groupsatfullsail/
What are you doing today?
By resting you mean... sleeping?. Or... reading?
Get better!. Have you been eating healthily and exercising regularly?
That's awesome!. Future workout buddy for December break?
So excited to move to the Bay area!
http://www.apexmovementnorcal.com/the-gym. 40 minutes from SF!
Pretty fun!
I think it's stay pretty fun!. As long as I don't injure myself or anything
We're having a vigil tonight at UVA!
To "Eliminate the Hate". Well, that's the organization that runs it at least. https://www.facebook.com/events/344647432559310/
I'll let you know how it goes!
Sure thing!
I didn't make the vigil due to a project meeting, but the video shows a great turnout. We had a really nice dicussion in my class about the result of the election.. Everyone is hurting for sure though.
Nope, other project!
Computer vision.. Have you had any discussions with anyone yet about the election?
I'm here if you need anyone!
I think it's really appalling that Trump could be elected. His viewpoint is very unreasonable, and for people to condone it is not okay. Hate speech should not become the norm, but we will have to try very hard to stop it since America's figurehead gives haters a voice. On the other hand, democrats in the house and Senate need to take the high road and not just be the party of No's. And Americans need to have discussions instead of being unwilling to see the other's side of view. Hate often  comes from misunderstanding, so we need to inform everyone and promote productive discussion instead of hate speech.. Now is more the time than ever to be an activist. Women amd minorities who voted for Trump are not making the best choice for themselves, as Trump's viewpoints take us back into pre feminist days. Likely it's  because they've come to believe that what's best for the 1% is best for them (Marxist theory). It's hard to believe everyone who voted for Trump is not also racist and a hater, but it's hopefully not true. I plan to read some Trump supporters opinions on the Web to get a better idea.. What are your thoughts?
There's a lot of rural vs urban involved. Also, the scary part is the people who will think that hate crimes are okay because our next president does too.. We've seen a lot at UVA already this semester. Let's talk more later.. Goodnight!. Feel free to type anything else still. :(
There is tons of positivity on Facebook and the internet! The main sentiment (by Obama too) is that we are a team.. Sleep tight
Maybe you're friends with the wrong people ;). On my feed the positivity outweighs any other force. But sad positivity for sure
And a lot of fear and uncertainty. Uva is a good community for being reasonable
But really, they should not have voted third party if they didn't want Trump :P
Definitely not the same. We elected someone with no experience,  no platform. It's totally unheard of. Hillary has had experience and isn't a walking antagonist
Not the same kind of fear. They don't have to worry about being deported or going to jail or not being allowed to love who you want with Hillary
But it's as if "hate" won. And it's really painful for a lot of people, including kids
Why?
If Hillary won, Hate speech would be condemned, but with Trump, all the opinions we have been working to change are resurfaced and suddenly okay. But we can't allow them to be the norm. It's 2016, and I can't believe it's still a question as to whether each of us should have the same rights. We have a choice of whether we will be divisive or not, and I think Hillary supporters are the ones leading the movement to bridge the gap between political differences and stop the hate. I'm super shocked that you think it would've been the same either way. Like it doesn't matter that Trump is president.. I think it's terrible.
No, we should control it. It's not okay, but we won't punish it--we will prompt those who harbor hate speak to have productive dialogues. Instead of "Muslims go home", it should be "I'm afraid of losing my job". Hate is not a result. It's an opponent we are all fighting against together. Hate speech is not free speech
What is a good solution to reach those people then?. We never figured it out in class. Just better education,  we thought. If you can't have respectful disagreements and conversations, then you are way undeveloped as a person
So what's the solution?. :( I need to sleep!. Goodnight!

There are still a bunch of empty spots on this bus, so if you have any friends that wanna come to YHack and enjoy a weekend of hacking, swag, and food, they can feel free to come on the bus! However, they must go to yhack.org and create an account. After they do so, please tell them to email us and we'll take care of the rest. Hope to see you soon!  Best, Chris"
Do both to be safe, but address it to Chris.
I was hoping to meet some students that I might be able to team up with for the project!
Hopefully not everyone is going with a friend already. You can be on my team for sure, but I think you could come up with a project you'd rather do, certainly
You could find students and form a team too!. Might be a project that is heavily reliant on good graphics
No, just wanted you to have the opportunity to come to YHacks!. It's a really great opportunity to compete, meet cool students, and just enjoy learning something new. I think it's really short-sighted of you to say you don't bring as much to the table as a coder does. You should be proud of your strengths and understand that a great team is one made up of people with diverse skills
You can if you want to, but I think it'd be really limiting your potential. The project doesn't involve any graphics work besides a logo. UX is always relevent, if you're interested in learning Android layout skills
Oh you'll be seeing a lot of me, I'm sure!
It's up to you too!
But I'm really encouraging myself to reach out of our comfort zone and try and make an effort to collaborate with people I don't know. eep, grammar. Join the yhacks group
Okay
Yup, thanks!
No
No problem!. Back up your laptop
Are you going?
Yay!. Will you bring me an extra eyemask?. I'll forward you the info for what to bring!
I'll trade you earplugs for eyemask? :P
I forwarded you the information!. It would be best if you figured out the bus contact, that way you can call them if you can't find it
I don't have that one. You'd have to ask Chris. Did you get my other email?
I did
No problem!
Nope, nothing else!. Thanks!
I have one here I can bring!
Just for yourself
I just thought it'd be easier for you!. I have challah and larabars to share
Eep, just sprained my ankle :(. Need at least 4 weeks of recovery... When will that be?
Ah, just landed on it completely sideways. I'm okay!! I didn't even cry!!. Just cringed on the floor for a minute. :P. I know it's a partial tear and not complete because it hurts
Maybe grade 2?. Oh, yes please!. Nope, no wimpering either!. Haha, that's probably the most pain for me
Coupd you research whether a brace would help?
Breakdancing practice!  :P. I'm fine, might be a little hard driving home, but I'm okay :P Doing ab exercises instead
Maybe this will make me come up with creative new bboy moves that only use one foot!
Thanks
What is compression?
https://youtu.be/obVg7wYOybg. New inspiration
It's more than grade one for sure.. Not sure if it's 2 or 3
Maybe more is better?. And okay, thanks!
It feels heavy
Not really painful though?. And it kind of drops out when I turn it too far
Haha, have any crutches?
Not haha to the severity. Just imagining me using crutches. Hahaha!! "And intense."
Okay, I bet Yale will have medical people somewhere. Student health doesn't open until 8am
I can still move it around so probably not grade 3
Oh thank you!! I will replay you!
Ibuprofen too (100-200mg) !. Probably just need one crutch?
Yay, thank you!. Did you try it out?
Okay!. No snacks needed
Okay!
Generic. Just 1 is good!. Thank you!
I'm not sure :O. I don't know how to wrap my ankle
It's not the boot is it? :O. I don't want the boot
Well...
Whichever is least expensive. I like the read tablets. Red*. Yay, thank you#. If it matters, it's my left foot
:(. I'll be okay! Going to sleep now with it elevated. Goodnight! !
:P. Sleep tight!
See you tomorrow!
I love you too!!
Battery?
Under the seats?. Sometimes there is one up near the driver on the wall next to them
Nooooooooooo
Are you sure no wifi?
Oh good! They might not have turned it on!
Is it unlimited, or just for him? :O
Thanks for asking
Okay!!
Yes! Outlets, yay!
Ye a h!
Both
Good! I'm going to sleep more because dark
Are you on time?. Ahh, walking has never been so hard
Yay!. Hope I'm not doing too much damage!
eta?
Eta?. Plz look it up
Thank youzsssdddf!!!
Ah, which address?. I'm not with group yet
You're good!. Close?
Just showered! In case you were wondering where I was!
http://www.geeks.gallery/face-detection-in-android/
May I call you while I walk home!. ?*. Almost home. :o. So close. Made it in the house safely!!. Goodnight! !. For the toll money, let me know how much is left after tolls!. I am supposed to send any excess back to YHack!
Okay good!!. I'm glad you made it home and I hope you're sleeping well too!
I hope you do too! It was so nice getting to see you!
Thank you for being my pillow :3
And for the umbrella!
Thank you!! Seeing someone about my ankle shortly!
I thought about that :P I think my insurance would cover it. How much were the things I asked you to buy?. I will pay you back!
Also, how much did I hand you for tolls yesterday?. Was it $100 or $80m
?* forgot to keep $20 for myself
Okay great, thanks!
Nope, that's it!
Yup!. Good results for ankle!
Definitely will!!
Just had it :P
That it's not severe and I can start rehab exercises!  I was given a stretch band!
I can start sports again once I can jump on each foot and run and sprint figure eights with no pain!. I didn't check if the brace is okay!. But I think so
After trying some of the exercises, I think I will recover quickly!
Hey, Toronto?
Yay*
Voice recognition was off :P. Hey=yay
Ohh
That sounds awesome. :O
:O!!
It's working!! :O. I like talking to you, I've just been nonstop in class or meetings or OH since 3:30pm. Still in meeting
Face collector :P
That's my file system
Yeah! It's actually cropping the faces now :D
My day w as great! I went to the gym, student health, did homework,  and had a bunch of classes and meetings. This week is really intense because lots of projects are due soon. What did you do today?
It was supposed to be yesterday, and now I think it is just a running basis
No problem!
Anytime!. Maybe in the next week is ideal. If you can make some gif (like an intro animation), then bonus points
Are you sure I cannot pay you back for the brace and ibuprofen and eye mask and tape?
Okay! Thank you again!!
I'm glad I didn't need it!!. But I didn't know at the time. So thank you!!
Sweet dreams to you! Sleep tight!. ^-^
:3. Until your next visit then!!. I love you!!
HackDuke is this weekend :D!. I bet there is room on the VT bus :P. Well I will see you over thanksgiving break!. Oh no, we missed the supermoon!. Hey, don't give up on the job search!. Maybe you can see if Modea will let you job shadow and do some work for free so you can get a bit of experience!!. Not ideal, but definitely better for your resume then not doing anything productive!. And maybe they can give you connections to other places
I can even compose the email for you if you want ;P
Just find the right person to send it to!
It shouldn't be hard to get a work for free position :P You don't even need experience for that?. It looks like they want 2-4 years experience,  CSS, HTML experience in their new hires, based on their listings, so getting a full time job looks tough unless you have your foot in the door
Just an email address is fine. One that they will read
Who is he?
You're looking for HR or hiring contact.
Do you remember who you job shadowed at Modea?
But do you have their name?
Please do!
Oh nos. Always get that business card!
Do you know what Ozmo is?
https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?type=all&keywords=human%20resources%20modea&orig=FCTD&rsid=3398076441479226375231&pageKey=nprofile_view_nonself&trkInfo=tarId%3A1479226374724&trk=global_header&search=Search&openFacets=N,G,CC&f_CC=206185
Dear Modea,  Are you looking for an awesome graphic designer who you don't even have to pay? Well you're in luck! My name is Peter Mattox. I grew up in Blacksburg and I'm a recent graduate of Radford University. I've been applying for design firms non-stop, but am having trouble getting my foot in the door anywhere. Here's where you come in. I would love to get some experience volunteering at Modea until I am able to find a full time job, and hopefully you would love to have a hardworking extra designer around the office.  I live about 2 blocks from Modea and I even job shadowed one of your designers one day when I was in high school. I really admire your company! This would be an amazing opportunity for me, so I hope you will consider it!  Please let me know what you think either way. The worst thing would be to not hear back at all. I have attached my resume for refrence, and my online portfolio is ________________.  Thank you! Peter Mattox. Just needs an email address. Or just go there in person and ask
Try freelancing. https://www.toptal.com/?x=q. https://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/c/design-creative/sc/graphic-design/
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-freelance-graphic-design-sites. https://99designs.com/designers. Director of operations? He's probably way too busy.. I imagine an HR rep would be more appropriate
He's part of everything. https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsoccolich
Yes, that would be a more appropriate person to ask, but emails are non-existent. And linkedin messages aren't reliable. Are you an aiga member?. You can use their job board site if so. http://designjobs.aiga.org/
Glad you found it!
Up to you!
Probably not since you just want experience
You're not applying really... just asking?
Haha, they probably think you are a client. ?*
Well looks like you should just give up...
I was kidding :P
Sweet dreams!
Good morning!. So.. HackDuke this weekend? :P
Nah, there's space on the VT bus for sure! (Maybe). I have the bus leads contact info. Are you still able to register online?
You could totally still go if room on bus
They are chill!
What did you do yesterday?
What did you draw?
Neat! May I see?. Oh nice!. Going to work more on those today?
Have fun!
Yay!! It has resurfaced!. Yesterday I went to the gym and made lots of green smoothies and did classes and projects!
Yes!
Didn't you show that to me first? :P
Looks great!
What do you mean?
Oh, okay
Cornbread!
Sweet potatoes with nuts in them :D. Is that a thing?. What about you?
Oh, it's cute! Thanks!. Goodnight!. No to marshmallows :P
Do you like the Lil marshmallows?
Cute things aren't always yummy!
The power of neural nets..!. https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/
Hello back!
That's cute! It's going well! Just met with VTOL team and going to class now!. How about you?
Oh, how's the drawing look now?
Is that the back?
Nice!
The gif would be like an animated logo screen at the start of the games
I think so! Like maybe just the sun shining. Or the little guy with the cannon on the top of the tower firing. Or anything else cool. Like the Pixar lamp :P
Yeah, try out lots of things!
Hear back about any jobs?
What efforts have you made lately?
Neat
Exploring the cultural neighborhoods and the island sounds fun
If you want to!
Driving most likely!
It looks good!. I think it looked better as a sketch though. Maybe the tower with a sun behind it would be a good logo?
Oh, okay!. Also for Canada, I probably would not go if you weren't planning! I haven't made any plans yet
I don't have any comparisons!
Example?
No, I was going to go with you if I did go!
That looks cute!
That looks good too.. The "cleaner" one is fine, I don't like the color scheme for the red/yellow/grey one, but I can forward it to the team anyway!. And the one in just black looks a little Rockbandy
Well thanks for making all those! They look great!
Goodnight!! Sleep well!
Thanks ^-^. Good morning!! I hope you have the best day!!
Oh I'm going!. Leaving at 3am :P
Thanks
Saturday*. :O
Any plans for this weekend?
Oh, well what are you doing then?
Wizard of Oz?
How's your demo reel going?. It looks like the application opened already for Pixar!
What have you done so far?
Nice! That sounds great. Wish you were here!. There is a drawing contest you would be awesome at and puppies coming at 3pm. ;(
I'm making a chrome extension for Facebook carpool groups!. :(
Because you're not here
That's okay
Nah, that's okay! Thanks though
Thanks. How was your yesterday and today?
Just okay? :O
What have you been up to?
I like them ^^
Like a cute little polar bear?
You're the empty pot :(
Just gotta keep chatting with me I guess :P
I'm a little stumped on UX. But maybe I'll just adapt it to what's easiest to code :P
Nah, I didn't attempt to form one
Haha, if you want!
Maybe a cool Facebook-style logo. for carpool finder. But not too much Facebook so that it is trademark conflict
I haven't decided what to call it, but I think carpool finder is good. Yeah, that sounds great!. It will be a chrome extension icon, specifically
The actual icon size should be 96x96 (for square icons); an additional 16 pixels per side should be transparent padding, adding up to 128x128 total image size. For details, see Icon size. The image must be in PNG format. The image should work well on both light and dark backgrounds.. And also needs a 48x48 and 16x16 size
Oh I think I like the blue car one, and also the black.. The background color it will be on is the chrome grey color on the url toolbar. I think. Thank you so much!. I'm trying Soylent for the first time.. It is so filling :O
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mLYCnqCrrrVh4DRknfnvk1_1cKON8sxpI5Xk5MB7wPk/edit
Scroll down to soylent challenge!. Do you have a soylent bottle to draw on? :P. black is great!. Could you name them icon___.png. with __ being 128, 48, and 16
You can save the black ones in one folder, and the blue in another folder!
Up to you!. You know what's best!
Okay!. Another technique I've seen is to outline grey shapes with a darker color
Oh thank you!. That's weird. I would just draw a cute thing.
Too obscure to be common knowledge. And still weird
Also, I think this is to promote soylent, not make people grossed out by it
I think if I gave a survey, the people our age who know what that is would be less than 50% of people.
I feel like its less common than you think. :P
But we'd need a survey to know for sure
Aren't you the younger generation?
??
:O. Yum, Korean food!!
It is really good!!
How are you? :3. What are you eating?
Yum!
Is it tough to make?
Ah, I see.. I still do want to go to Toronto! Are you still planning it?
That'd be awesome!. You are the cupcake
Yes.
Can't get to you.....
Your best friend right here probably
I was off playing night Frisbee :P
We used a light up one!
Are you going to stay up with me? ^-^
^-^ Thank you!!. :3
You're good
Great!
Thank you!!. :P. Might take a nap soon :O. But still a ways to go
I'm able to extract latitude and longitudes with ~80% accuracy from FB carpool posts!. Like this one: "Looking for a ride back to Blacksburg from Fredericksburg/Stafford/Richmond/Chesterfield on Sunday!". also able to get the dates :D. And whether they are riding or driving
Just need to finish porting the API into a library format, putting it in Django, deploying to AWS, then building a Chrome app to Display it :O. Maybe a 20 minute nap would help
Nah, I won't nap until I have it deployed in AWS
Thank you ^-^. I will be okay!. You can get some sleep if you like!. How was the brisket?
^-^. It's a code journey!
What does your journey involve?
Snacks in place of brisket!
Yum!
Now :P. I'll be back..
Are they though?. Good thing my pillow is a pillow!
It went well!
Yeah! Just ran into a jpype bug, so couldn't get the Web end up, but I'm going to work on it over break!
Nope!  Closing ceremony!
Purple and great!
I will!
Thanks! I am in cville!
At rice hall. Brushing my teeth!
I parked at the stadium, so I can drive home!. It wasn't cold walking here!
Haha, is it smart?
Okay, maybe!
Oh no. The Google bag is dying!!. Must find new one...
I bet someone at UVA has one
Home safely!
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!!
Thanks for staying up with me!!
I hope you did too!
Thank you! You too!
It's not so bad! I plan to do work over break
Thanks
I'm hosting ISA office hours! What about you?
Oh good. How do the characters look now?
Cool! Thanks for the preview.
Goodnight to you too!
Thank you!
Leaving now!
It's fine, I can pick it up sometime!
Goodnight!
Thanks for the thought!
I hope you do too!
Yes
Your pick!
What's wrong?
Oh!. Going to the duck pond would be nice!
Saturday would be good!
No thank you
Okay! What would you like to do?
Okay
No, not at all.
Why is that?
I don't
Why?
Why would I like talking to you though? It's just been small talk. I don't even know where to start to change it.
I feel like you're purposely not saying much because you assume I don't care or something. Then it's my bad. I just don't know..
What should we do? :O
Do you think so?
I do though
Maybe tomorrow.... I'll get to sleep soon!
As you wish
You're not bothering me
Why are you heartbroken?. Nothing has changed
Well nothing has changed between now and yesterday
Why?
Sorry to make you feel that way
?
No problem!. Goodnight to you!
I do love you, I haven't given up on you.. Did you manage to get to sleep?. Good morning!!
Yay, you're awake!!!!!. Want to get a shot today?
What time are you mowing?
Neat!. Your neighbors houses?
Oh cool!!. Need any food or refreshments?
Safety glasses!
I have some
Take me for a walk!
Yay!!
Either way is fine!! Maybe we can skateboard together!
Oh whoops, it would be dark,
Hey, I will not have to be in best of luck to all of your own, but it was not a problem , that would be the best. if you want. you are be the , and 20th , 20th, but I don't think it was not a problem with that. I will have the right to your account. You can get it. I have a great day, I will have the best of luck. the first one to the next few weeks. I am a very long. I have been in a while, and the rest. the first one. the first one. the first one. I am a beautiful and a lot more to do with the same time. the only thing that you are not the same for the first to write a review of the day of work to do with a little while, so I'm sure it is a good idea. the only one that has the best of all of you have a lot more to. The trigram model?
Yes
No problem
Thanks
What kind of walk?. Probably not since it's dark!
Thank you. I hope you do too. How are you doing?. See anything nice while outside?
I'm good! I'm reading about infinity.. What makes a woody alder aphid?
Wow, nice picture!!. There is no beyond :P. But there are multiple infinities
I heard your uncle died. I'm sorry :(
What is your family doing for Thanksgiving?
Do you have a Thanksgiving tradition?
That's too bad! Well if someone wants to make the effort, it shouldn't be hard to get everyone together for a thanksgiving dinner!!
I mean your family.
That sounds like something at least!!
*need belly rub*. Pretend that's a polar bear!
Ah yay!!!!!!!!!!! ^-^ That's me!!. :3. You should make a sticker line!
You just need Adobe illustrator!. And tumblr?
No, it's just a cute
Cute!. Polar bear that is eating om  nom
And cuddle polar bear $. !*
Just one being cuddly!
Rawr!!!!!#
We need to see Moana
I need so many cuddles
I need your cuddles :3
^-^!!!! Whenever?
That's great. Can I come curl up on you on Friday?
Maybe just for a bit!!
*poke*
What are you doing?
And talking to me and that's it?
Neato!. Can you still see?
Polar bears?
Oh good!!. Yay, cuddle! !!. :3. Will you really provide cuddles?
Do you want to?
Oh good!. What else are you up to besides cooking/eating tomorrow?
But what are you planning?
What are you drawing?
I like the first bear the most!
Yes!!. Can he be all of them?
What time is good for Friday cuddles?
No black Friday shopping :P. What's new for you?
Learning anything new?
It doesn't have to be art related things. Just anything
Don't go out of your way to learn things unrelated to art?. What about when you looked up how to make chocolate?
Or when you read the news?. Or reading any book ever (not art textbook)?. And if you did, would that even be a good thing?
Why would you restrict what you learn though?
Isn't that the same thing?
But the two are exclusive.. If I choose to play sports more, then I am choosing not to do other things.. aren't*****. n't on the run
What are some things on your bucket list?
That's sounds really interesting!
What would you like to climb?. The ruins?
Haha, riding alpacas.
I want to inspire people somehow, maybe through YouTube or giving a talk somewhere, or just making or doing something.. And I want to give a performance.. And I want to travel and find out what other people in the world are like and understand what problems need solving. And I want to read books.
It's exciting!. On a related note, what are some of your goals/aspirations?. I kind of grouped these in my bucket list, but I think sometimes people only put the crazy adventurous stuff on their bucket list
Hmm.. what are your plans for the future?
Is your plan just to work at the same job every day for forever? What kind of job is it?
Neat. Does it matter what kind of graphics you make?
What about military propoganda?. Or fake pharmaceuticals?. Ahh, my spelling skills are declining :P. :O*
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit_medications. Would it be important to you that the company you design for is morally correct?
aka ethics. Oh good.. What about your future plans outside of work?
Haha the "Like what?" was like implying that there is no life outside of work.
Like hobbies :P and friends. and purpose
Purpose is like... purpose in life
Hmm, that's interesting! I wonder how she eats.. I think my purpose is whatever I decide, so for me it is to make the most of every day and enjoy what I'm doing, try to be the best I can, correct wrongdoing, and be a good human for our world.. What do you think your purpose is?
What is it currently? It's fine to leave room for change.. Art/creating?. As long as that doesn't stop your commitment!
By haven't you had the opportunity to be a good boyfriend?
You still get to opportunity to interact with me though! Phone calls, messages
What was the cause?. I thought it was not enough talking to you.
I didn't like how our conversations were going because they were very terse and unimportant
But you don't even know the small things in my day
Well thank you. I'm glad you do. I just felt like all last week you didn't care to start any conversations and just stopped in to say Hi and Bye. It didn't leave much room for starting anything on my side
That was just yesterday, I thought?
Me saying I didn't like talking to you (because of the non-conversations)
Eep, don't remember saying that directly, but I know I've definitely mentioned that I would like to have more conversational conversations. Which you have definitely worked on, but then something killed it. Probably me.. I have to sleep. To be continued.. Goodnight!
I'm really glad you have ambitions and goals and future because I was getting worried.. I should've just asked though
It's okay. I think it's just because you don't have a job and I never feel like you're trying hard enough and it's worrying. And maybe a retail job would be better than nothing. At least you are mowing!
Because I've been thinking about next year and it's really not going to work out if you're just at home with no job.. Read up more on networking advice.. It seems to me based on what I saw that you can't just rely on online applications. You need to actually reach out to people. Find something in-state if you can't find something out of state. Lots of stuff up in Nova
Are you not planning on having a job next year?. It's been a whole semester almost.. Do you feel like you've learned as much as you would have a semester in classes?. Or that you've been as productive as you would've been on a job somewhere?
I would say the goal is to make sure that unemployment isn't affecting your productivity. Treat finding a job like a job.. What do you think about getting a job in retail or service?
Why would you prefer not to?. You shouldn't if you don't want to.. That's silly.
So you see it as a dead end?
It wouldn't be about learning, it would be about motivating yourself to be productive and building your self-worth. But if you can do that without a job, then that's fine.. Not to mention student loans?. Maybe MishMIsh is hiring?
And then on the side, you should be promoting yourself as much as possible
Behance online portfolio. Or even social media. If you can make some cute character like that polar bear go viral, then the ad revenue would keep you afloat
No. Bear looks like the one you drew first, because I see that picture everyday in my room in Charlottesville.. He can be Bear if you want though
When you said "you should probably cut ties sooner than later," does that mean you aren't confident in yourself?
But I want you. I just want you with ambitions and independent smarts and a career.. Because I don't want to have to teach you how to use a credit card, or pay rent, or get health insurance when you're a year older than me. But I know your parents can teach you (;. Thoughts?. Uncensored hopefully
Then I can build up my respect for you and be a better girlfriend than I have been.
Still on for cuddles on Friday after this?
I would like to :3
That makes me happy (:
Sweet dreams, Peter
Happy Thanksgiving!!
Yeah!
Leaves!!. Crunchy!
Ouch, that would be pointy!. Are you cooking Thanksgiving dinner?
Yum yum!!!. Have a great Thanksgiving dinner (:
What is a good time to come tomorrow?. 8am?
It does or I would not have suggested it!
Cuddles? :3
Yay! <3. How to make sweet potato casserole?
How are you making it?. Will there be corn bread? :O
Yummy!
Hmm? Aren't you guys eating tonight?
Oh good!  Why cook tomorrow?
Are you having another thanksgiving tomorrow?
Aw, that's nice!. It won't be necessary though.
Okay!. I hope you had a great Thanksgiving!!
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Adidas-Womens-Performance-Black-Vista-Grey-Soccer-Condivo-14-Training-Pants-/122106490380?var=&hash=item1c6e1d2e0c:m:mNnzHR8cdk0de7jDjgYavMg. :O. I think I like the black and white more though. Plus $50 is way too much..
Men's pants are fitted differently!. Thanks though!
Nope!
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo. :P
Excited to see you tomorrow!!!
Did you want to do anything?
Yeah!
I plan to do homework ^-^
Oh maybe! I can do homework at my house though
Okay!
That's the idea! I also happen to wear these a lot!
1 more!. :P. Maybe just one is enough though...
Hmm?
?!?!? :O. How did you find them?
Whoa, that's so cool!. They sure are expensive though!
Paypal is a good idea!. But if you pay with your capital one card you can always dispute it too.. They have good customer service!
:3 Cool!
Oh sweet!. Wow, you sure are a keeper ^-^
Yes!. Who will be at your house tomorrow?
Go where with your dad?
"shopping"? :O
Neat!
Nope!. If you think of something you want to do though, that could help!
That's okay!
It is always very comfy 9:. (:*
Would there be any possibility of you picking me up?. My car is pretty blocked in
8am is good!
See you then!
What was your day like? What did you do?
Wow, that's a very very long time to rake :O. My leaves will just decompose :P
Did you want to work out with me tomorrow?
Do you have any room inside your house for 2 yoga mats?
And room for jumping?
But could your house stand up to the jumping?
Maybe I would shower and get ready at your house then?
That's kind of neat!
Sure there's enough room?. Will showering at your house be weird?
Okay! And definitely enough room?
Okay!. Shall we do 9am instead?
9 is better for sleeping!
No, I'd rather be awake!. Is your house nice and warm?
Good ;3. Sleep tight!
Eep, 9:30?
Good morning!!. I can come with you later if you want company!
Not yet!. 9:30 is good
Do you have towels, wash cloth, and hair dryer, or should I bring some?
Which would you prefer? Bringing less would be awesome!
Oh good!! Thank you!
Oh yay!!!. When did you send this?. Do you have yoga mats at your house?
I love you!!!. You are the best boyfriend
Oh good!!!. Now to do homework!. You too!!!. What will you do?
Pokemon Go?. :P
:O. Have a nice walk.
Yeah, but it's only one step in a lifestyle changing process.
Here's the article I showed you earlier for reference: https://medium.freecodecamp.com/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331#.dm57at5ua
http://lifehacker.com/the-pokemon-go-interval-training-workout-1783487992. I'm going home on Sunday!
Thanks for the invite though
I want to feed the ducks ^-^ !!!!!
Oh, when we go get our flu shot? :D
:O
?. Random question. What do you think about plastic surgery?
Why are you not a fan?
Any other thoughts?
Interesting.
I think it's terrible for just vanity purposes because it perpetuates the idea that attractive people are more valuable. Whatever society's idea of attractiveness is at the time, at least.
I'm fine with plastic surgery for health problems or burn marks or chimpanzee attacks or cleft palate. Or even loose skin after weight loss. But making your face different is really strange.
That's sounds super illogical. What reasoning brought you to that thought?
?
No, I can see it working, I just want to hear you explain it more convincingly. :P
Just explaining your thought process is fine.. I liked what you were saying, but you never really brought it full circle back to prove a point.. :P It can be fun to practice those communication skillz
That could be. A related idea that came to mind is that the popularity of plastic surgery for non-health reasons allows the profession to be more profitable, which draws more doctors to the field, thus making them easier to find without having to travel a long way to receive treatment.. But I would argue that research for cleft-palate surgery methods would have enough funding from organizations like the NSF to gather enough knowledge independent of any vanity surgeries.. And I bet there are plenty of ways to practice on cadavers without needing a swath of patients to practice on.
But are the surgeries related enough to have any training benefits? And without those non-health surgeries, would the doctors be any less prepared?. I would argue that doctors would be just as prepared without the addition of face lifts, implants, etc.. I think it's a separate field, to an extent.
Or not a separate field, but I don't think doctor struggle with "extra practice.". with needing*. They would still get a lot of clients who need surgery for health related reasons.
Perhaps they could even focus more on those techniques and get even better.
As I mentioned earlier, I think science grants allow plastic surgery techniques to be well researched.. And overall, I don't think non-health related plastic surgeries are necessary to improve healthcare in the field.. So if fewer people participated, it would not be detrimental (besides the problem of fewer providers).
Thanks for providing me with opposing viewpoints to consider ^-^
Practice makes perfect!. Think DBQs in APUSH. And persuasive essays :D
My favorite!. It's a good life skill for sure.
It'd be really fun if you wanted to do regular debates!!
Sometimes in class, I feel like I can't contribute to discussion because I don't think of insightful comments quickly enough (or without consulting outside resources).. So it'd be good to practice!
Oh good (:
You're great!
Haha :P. Hmm.... I'm not sure when I'll finish my HW6 assignment for Machine Learning.. I'll probably go to sleep at midnight because I prefer to work in the morning!. When are you free tomorrow?
That's true!
Aw, okay ^-^. Thank you!!. I'm going to be working out with my sister tomorrow! Maybe you can do the same!
Work out with your sister, I mean!. Oh thank you!. Rawr :3
:3. It must be really hard to help overweight family members. There aren't any conclusive resources on the internet :O
Yeah?. So what are you to do to help?
A condition? :O Oh no. What condition?
Oh no, how do you not know what it's called? Is it not that serious?
No, but I thought your parent's might know and passed it on to you at some point.. parents*
You could google it!
No :j. c:
No, I'm sleeping ^-^
I will go soon :3. We slept 1.5 hours!
It was very good sleep!. Oh no, are you sad?. :3. Mission to clean my room, take 6 is underway!!
Hi!!!. How are you?
Oh no! It needs squishing!
Do you feel like you need a doctor?
Okay. What are you doing today?
Yay!!! Would you like to participate in the room destruction?. It's fun because I'm not keeping much this time around :P
Yes! You get food!. As reward for helping
Jello?
Okay!! (:
Okay!! That sounds good!
:P anytime you can then!!. I'm trying to leave for Goodwill by 3:30!. I mean YMCA. On the way?. :3
I love you so so much! Get home safely!
Good morning!!. I love you  :3
:D Happy Sunday
That'd be fantastic! $. !!*. But what about the hanging of the green?
Oh cool!!!. Walmart Auto Center is open! And we can go get flu shots!. And after that, would you want to accompany me while I finish my app at my house?. If you have any work, you can bring it!!
Yes!!!!!. Tuna sticks!!!
I'll come at 11am!
I'll let you know when I leave the house!. Do you have duck food?. I hear they like dry cat food!
Could you double check online if it is safe?
Well we are going to walmart! What is a good choice for themm. ?*
I might postpone those errands since I'm short on time!
On the way now!. I am slow poke :O
Is it okay to park across the street?. Here!
I moved to the back!
Stopping for gas.
You at my house?. Meet
In CVille! Thank you so much for everything last night!. The presentation was a success! Thank you!. Oops! Meant to click the second one :O. Would it be weird if I paid you for your graphic design work?
Aren't you pitching in for Toronto anyway? So it would help alleviate your portion?. My budget for Toronto is around $500.. Not sure if that is reasonable yet, but we can take the total and then split it either $500 and you pay the rest, or if the split is more than 75/25, then I'll pay 75%. You get sweat equity for planning it, so you don't have to pay as much :P
Are you sure?. Would you be open to other commissioned work this week? :P. Okay! I think I'll have some time on Friday!. Actually today I can look at any airbnb listings. Since we should book a week in advance
Okay!
6th through 10th. Unless there is benefit to night traveling/check in
This has parking?. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7349220?checkin=12%2F06%2F2016&checkout=12%2F10%2F2016&guests=2&adults=2&children=0&infants=0&s=Wl1AqYhl. Also, that was what I thought would work, but what do you think?
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avisinna&hl=en
Parking is for a fee!. Street parking through the city I think.
Need to make sure it's practical to travel where we want to go!
I think the Trendy one would be great!. Not having to worry about parking is the biggest plus, and it seems like it's close to restaurants, which could be handy.. Maybe just confirm that it's not too far from the places we want to go by using the pin location at the bottom of the listing!
Sounds like a good one!
Yup! As long as Niagara Falls is open on the 10th!. And maybe weather not too bad?
You can just hike the trail near by!. http://justinpluslauren.com/niagara-falls-in-winter/
You can pick where we stay on 12/10!
I think Buffalo, Rochester, or Niagara Falls would be good. Hmm, not sure about the weather
We could always go up on the 6th, stop there on the way up, and then keep going to Toronto all the same day. Especially if it's just a little hike out to see the Falls!. I think they do illuminations at night too, so that would be fun to see!
We could get there around 3pm and stay until dark!
Dark is like 5pm :P. And then we can head to Toronto and check in at Mark's. And then still stay in Rochester, Buffalo, or somewhere else on the 10th!. We can stay anywhere on the way to Charlottesville on the 10th, just nothing else on the way looks very interesting!. Rochester is a bit out of the way :P
Yup, unless something else interests you!
Yup yup!. Let me make sure my discover card is paid off enough for the charge. I have $306 available on my credit line!. https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/journey-student/
Works!. Say that parking was a big factor and we like that there is a private entrance. And the place looks really nice in all the photos. And close to public transit
You're good!. I'm in class, so I'll just assume it's awesome. I only have one discover card
Thank you!. Hi Peter!!
They work great and that's exactly my plan. How is your day?. Were*
That sounds fantastic!!!. I like your drawings (:. I'll know by tomorrow if I need help!. I hope you rest well too!!
Oh yay!. I'm eating yummy food now (:
Yes, my housemate brought it up!. Actually not "mmm"ing. Must just be a social thing then
It was not a shooting?. I just looked it up and it doesn't mention anything about a shooter...
Well I hope everyone will recover!!
So were you working on the Wizard of Oz drawing today or something else?
What is a spot illustration?
Oh awesome!!. I like the ones with ToTo!. Toto*
Tot!. Tater?
Ooh, it sounds familiar :O. I do not like tater tots :(. Do you like tater tots?. I have fond memories of the smile shaped ones though!
I've had them before!
Like the jackfruit chips? :D
:P I like them too! Thank you!. I eat too many though :P
Haha
It all makes sense now o.o!
Composing a symphony?
Hehe
:3. Well thank you for being amazing!!
^-^. I week to Toronto!
Sweet dreams (:
I love you so much! !
Neat!
Thank you (:. How is your Tuesday?
It is good and busy (:
Thank you !! What is in your day?
Oh thanks!!. Done forget to work really hard!. Don't *
Set goals and then meet them :3
When I was at home, time seemed to pass a lot faster and I felt like I didn't get a lot done :O
Nooo.... The worst super power!!
Maybe not in the boos, but you can in real life!. #freewill. Oh no, did I just hashtag!?
Aw thanks!
I do!. I need you to annotate something!. It should take less than an hour
The carpool finder for natural language processing again!
Similar to last time! I'll give you instructions tonight!
Oop, maybe tomorrow morning instead :O. Yay, push a little button!
Thank you !!. Sweet dreams (:
I love you too!!
Yay, good morning!!
Early morning for you?  (:
Yeah!!. Going to the gym (:
Ah, I will try! :D
^-^. Aw :3
Thank you! I hope you do too!. What is your day looking like?  (:
Start with workout :D!. And then email recruiters!. I'll give you the annotation later
Eep, I keep messing up my tights :O
https://www.amazon.com/National-Run-Resistant-Sheer-Pantyhose-6-pk/dp/B0006GXGTK. Maybe this is the answer1. ! *. I will put it on my Christmas wishlist :P
I was hoping you could record the accuracy of those results
Look at the original post and identify how many dates are referenced, and then record how many dates were correctly found by the results. Example:. I'm taking 95 south back to SOUTH CAROLINA!! The 843. Leaving Friday @ 2 p.m. [     {         "end": 68,          "start": 62,          "text": "Friday",          "type": "DATE",          "value": "2016-11-18"     },      {         "end": 77,          "start": 71,          "text": "2 p.m.",          "type": "TIME",          "value": "2016-11-16T14:00"     }. Dates present: Friday @ 2p.m.. this was correctly identified (11-18). So if this were the only post the accuracy would be 100%. Keep track of 3 numbers. 1.  The total number of dates mentioned in the posts. 2. The total number of correctly identified dates (should be less than or equal to (1).. 3. The number of dates found that are not dates in the message.. So in the end, just report these 3 numbers to me!
Tomorrow at 11am!. There's another annotation possibility too that I will get to you at 7:30pm tonight!. If you want to do it!. Also keep track of how long you spend on it. That way I can compensate you appropriately!
Yay thank you!. How are other things going for you?
Power naps are supposed to be good for you!. How long was it?
That's a second sleep!. :P
https://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/siesta/. Did you do it already?. If not, could you take note of all the time/dates that were not detected? And also the false positives?. Or at least a few good examples if you notice any trends
Oh thank you!!. The annotated one is the example!. I recommend using notepad++!. /brakets. brackets*
Let me know if you have any questions!!
How are you? :3
Good!
No worries, I'm working on my project!
Sweet dreams!
Will the annotations be ready by the morning?
Thank you!!
There is no notepad++ for Mac. Just use Brackets
All you need is a tsv editor. sublime is good too!
Sooner is possible!. if*. 9am would be safe
Yes please!
Part 1
I gave an example above. I just need an accuracy percentage, false positives percentage, and some examples of commonly missed time expressions.
So the 3 counts described and also examples. I gave examples above. "dates found that are not dates in the message". So everytime it thinks something that is not a date is a date, add one tally
No need to annotate, just take note of common mistakes. Maybe by copying and pasting the example. Also, what do you mean?
Still not sure what the confusion is. That example would be 100% accuracy. 1 count for date/time occurance, and 1 count for correct.
?. "text": "Sunday, Dec. 7 at 5:30 am",. This field is the important one. If it matches the date/time in the text, it's good
If there had been another date/time mentioned that was not picked up, that would be 2 counts of date/time occurance, and 1 count for correct
Does it make sense to you now?
Just use your best judgement. I'm trying to evaulate how accurate the system is
Could you put the examples in a separate txt document please?
And just summarize them in a list like this at the end? :  [ '2' -> not recognized as 2pm] ['11/4' -> not recognized as Nov. 4th]. There are 2 dates mentioned in the post, and they are both correctly identified.. Thanksgiving is a "false positive", so add it to the false positive count. (Part 3 described above)
No, just a count is fine for those. And no need to do every single one. Just 5 examples is fine. Thank you!. I'm getting to sleep now!
When in doubt, just make a decision!
That's 1 instance of date/time, and 1 correct. So add 1 to both of the first 2 counts. easy, right?
It doesn't matter. Just look at the "text" field
No, just 3 numbers and a text file
Yup!. I recommend just copying "LOC" and then pasting it over the O's whenever you identify a LOC
Oh I know you do!
Thanks for helping me out!!. Sorry, I didn't realize it would take you so long for the sutime ones $. !*. Gotta ignore all the fields other than txt :P
The things that were confusing you should have been ignored. I mentioned it a couple times, but I know it was late
5 posts that were not identified, but should have been.. What do you mean by this?. Those counts should have been included in the first count
That would be included in the first count.
??. Those are some of the most important, especially example wise.. These are posts that scored accuracy 0% and should be included in the first count.. Do you remember how many dates/times were not identified total in the 5 posts?
Exactly!
Also, your sutime_results-examples is a jpg?. I can't open it. Ah, I"m sorry I should've just done the counts myself. Will you example how you got the counts?. explain*. With an example?. If you did it right, there's no reason to redo it, but it sounds sketchy based on your last comment
Yes, so why didn't you tally the 5 posts that also included dates/times?
??. Did it not include a date/time?
Did the post include a date/time?. That's the first measurement. Not whether a date/time is output by the program
So you marked one tally for every output date/time instead of every date/time in the post?. Sorry, I feel like the time I've been instructing, I could've just finished already. Sorry for not giving you better instructions!. Just let me know how long you were working so I can pay you. Or if you want to do it again, that would be great too
Don't worry, I got it!. You should get paid. Because you spent time on it. That's my fault for not giving you clear enough instructions
I'm about halfway through
hehe "driving from nova to vcu this today,". Thank you for doing the Location annotations too!. I love you!!!. Yay, Presentation done!
Well you did well!
^-^
Aww :3. That's very sweet!!
Yay, I'm going to Lighting of the Lawn!!!
Neat!#. Are they light?
That's neat!. Sweet dreams!
That's okay! Thank you for looking!!
Good morning! !
Happy Friday to you too!! What has your week been like?. How was your yesterday?
That's good!. What did you stay busy with?
Neat!. Stuff.
I'm looking forward to seeing you too!!. RAWR!
^-^. Yay, one research paper down, one to go!
How the job hunt going?. How's*
Cool! Which companies did you apply to?. Also, do the Addy's have a one year clemency?
I've never heard of those, but they sound neat! Where are they each located?
Neat!. Anything exciting happen this week?
Oh, what was exciting on Sunday? (:
But why was that exciting and your other days weren't exciting?
Maybe you need to do more rare activities then :D!
Indoor activities can still be unique!. Hehe, bring your warm clothes to Canada then!!!. It will be super cold!
Blue Jacket time!
Actually, it's the same temperature as it is here in Cville :P
Oh good!. I want to be warm too ^-^
With your green legumes?. Oh, that looks like Lift labs :O
Bought by google!
I was working on this problem my first year, but we didn't come up with as cool a solution!. Or not as cool, but as convenient/functional
Oh yeah!. What are you up to? :4. :v
An om nom face!
Care to share?
Whatever you have then :D. Oh it's a bird!
Cool doodles!
I want to have lots of warm clothes ^-^
Goodnight!
Halfway done!  Then two more after that :P. But sleeping for now ^-^
Some thin socks for ice skating?. And snow pants in case we go snowboarding?. And tons of warm clothes
No, things you should bring :P. Thanks though (:. Anything you need from me?
What is it?
Yes, that sounds good!. Good night again :D
Definitely! You had a list, right?. I was hoping you'd be doing most of the planning
Oh good!!. Thank you so much ^-^
We can discuss some Monday night too!. Sleep tight (:. I love you!!!
Good morning!. Haha :P Well afternoon. But maybe it's morning for you!. This looks like the thingy you made!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcYaLqEA4cM
Eep. how canyou tell?
hehe :P. How many bits is FB messenger?
What does it mean to be 8-bit?
2^8 = 256?. Hmm. Would the Youtube video qualify as 8 bit then?
Oh interesting! Why is that?
Sounds like technicalities ;)
What's your day been like so far?
Nooo, not the big nose!. But glad you like it!
I think it looks like a worm with a mouth
Make him a cutie!
I haven't seen any pictures of your new and improved bear. A side by side comparison would be good!. I like the bear lying on his back that you drew
I can't remember what he looks like
Yeah, but Lily has changed since then too
I would need a side by side comparison!
That's fine
Thanks!. Haha, are you sure?
I feel like the dialogue should be done together
What's a table read?. I just mean the characters should be interacting, otherwise you lose some of the connectedness
I was imagining each person in their own studio box and they can hear the other
I don't think it's necessary to be in the same room
When I meant together, I just meant in succession. So you know what the person before you said before you do your line. It could even just be passing audio files back and forth
No
Thank me for what?
You're welcome for the recordings!. What are you doing tonight/tomorrow?
What kind of food?
Yum!. Or cucumber sandwiches!
Which did you decide on?. And thanks (:. Good luck with what?
Oh thank you!. I hope the sweet potato casserole is a hit!
If you want! We'd have to eat it at the airbnb though :P
Up to you! We're passing through anyway, so why not just stop?
Sure!. I'm going to sleep now, so sweet dreams! (:
Good morning!! I hope your church potluck is fantastic!
30 to 35?. for a total of -5?
Depends on what we are seeing
I'm not interested in the Wonderful Life play. I've never even seen it :P
Ah, but I'd rather do a thing that you can only do in Toronto
It doesn't!. I just don't want to watch A Wondeful Life
Or any other play, really.. (with case by case decision)
Also, these are CAD, correct?
Casa Loma sounds good!
Thank you!
No, I want to rent
Just 1 day for skating is fine!
Either
Oh good!
^-^! Yum!!
Pretty cool how fast news carries!. https://twitter.com/search?q=standing+rock&ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch. How are you doing today?. How was church and after church?
My day was great! I had a good time studying with my friend Jake and am going to my previous housemate's apartment for dinner (I made two side dishes!). Currently reading a summary of a TV episode we were supposed to watch for class on Monday and working on my STS paper.. Good thing you are getting clothes to be warm!
Black Mirror, San Junipero
It seems like an interesting look at tech/society interactions!. I made farro & kale, and also a tomato, corn, avacado salad!. avocado*
They were pretty easy and they are healthy ^-^
Thank you!. How ready would you be to drive on Tuesday?
Okay good! Make sure you get lots of sleep Monday night!. I think I will be lacking in the sleep department and may need to sleep in the car for awhile
Thank you! :D. I really need to get better at writing papers.. :P. I've had so many years of experience though, but no luck.. Maybe there is a comprehensive guide I can make
I just mean that I spend 70% of the time thinking about writing it, 20% of the time researching for it, and 10% of the time actually writing. :P Low efficiency.. Yup, I can do that!
Do you not have warm socks?
No, I'm set
Okay!
Good ^-^
:D Long johns? :P
Thank you!. I love you too!!. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel ^-^. I think I may have found a good essay writing technique!
Will you proofread for obvious grammatical errors for me?
You the commenting mode to make any suggestions/fixes!. Use*. Eep, is it that bad?
Thanks!. Nah, that's fine (:. Nice comma catch!!. Wait, just kidding, that comma is good. I thought you added it, not removed it :P
It's like...< complex word>, <definition of complex word>, is _____.
Nah, the definition is just a list
I turned it in a 5pm! Thanks though!
Is there a washer at the airbnb?
Okay, thanks for checking!
I got it, thanks! Driving home now!
Yes, I'll be there at 7am!
Oh no, I sleeped :O. Slept!. Hopping in the shower now!
That's fine!. Moving things to the car now!!. On the way. Ahhh!#!!!!!. Leandra has given you a FREE Uber ride (up to $20). To claim your free gift, sign up using this link: https://www.uber.com/invite/leandrai6ue. Basketball. Psstt...

Have an awesome day!
Oh good!. I say hi too!
I'm not even there in person :P
I say hello too!. Sorry. if I hurt your feelings at all for kicking you out.. I just wanted to punish myself :(
Sorry!
Why still?. Anything I can do to cheer you up?
Have an awesome rest of your day too!!. I will miss you!. Thank you for playing trivia with me!
Okay!. How is your family doing?. Did they like the maple syrup?
RAWR!. :3

Could you ask your Dad how much we owe on mowing when you get a chance?
Thank you!
Okay, Scott might know then
Thanks!
Okay!. Thanks!. My mom says you guys used to charge $20. hard times?
Or just a price change?
Hmm, could you ask how much it costs per mow?
Also, could you send the link for the binoculars?. Sorry for asking so many things!
That's okay! I'm going to do them all in one order
Oh awesome thanks!
FIFA!!!. :O!!!
I can't remember, one of them had a polar bear logo in Turkey, the other has a shamrock in Ireland
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007JNWCDE/ref=psdc_297842_t1_B006U0Z72U. Did you see these ones too?
This one is 8x25 instead of 10x25. I think that means it is less magnification, but it will be brighter
If you want!. We are leaving at 7am tomorrow!
I'm done punishing myself. But I will likely just be working on my exam in the waiting room!. Not while I'm driving though :P. So we can listen to music or something!. I'll make a playlist!
It depends on what the other team is wearing :P
Hmm.... Maybe red and yellow!. Or yellow and red
Probably short sleeve. yellow with a red collar. Not collar like a polo, but just a v-neck. Maybe red around the sleeve rings and bottom cuff too.
My manager is Kelly Clarkson!. The team is whatever team you are managing. They already have names
That is a turkish team. I like how the shirts have stripes on the shoulder!. https://www.amazon.com/Adidas-Climacool-Manchester-United-Replica/dp/B012UHML66/ref=sr_1_50?ie=UTF8&qid=1481777501&sr=8-50&keywords=soccer+jersey+adidas
I also like the Spain shirt!. https://www.amazon.com/Spain-Home-Soccer-Shirt-2012/dp/B007V1N6FW/ref=pd_sbs_200_7?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B007V1N6FW&pd_rd_r=57JC7PJRHXVMQ5WRRGV6&pd_rd_w=Z0cU9&pd_rd_wg=Rrv6X&psc=1&refRID=57JC7PJRHXVMQ5WRRGV6
Red and yellow. But it looks nice!
Its beautiful O.O
Really!
http://www.liverpoolfc-newkit.co.uk/liverpool-fc-forum/new-2011-12-away-kit-at-long-last-t28903-30.html. This one is pretty nice too!
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Liverpool-Away-Shirt-2006-Small-Adidas-Yellow-Adults-S-Short-Sleeves-Top-Only-/291954627750?hash=item43f9da14a6:g:UNgAAOSwImRYEkpt. Yeah, but I wish it were the Standard Chartered instead. That one says Carlsberg on the front
The alleged 2011 one has a wider red v-neck. And a nicer stripe pattern. Also advertising a beer company would feel weird
It's not. But I wish it existed!. The spain one's the next best!
It is
Oh, haha!. Sweet dreams!. Text me when you're ready so I know whether to come pick you up or not!
Okay!! You will have time to eat breakfast, looks like we are leaving here 7:20ish
Cold weather today!
^-^. Ahhh, so cute!!!!. Derp
Hehe. Whoops, that's kinda creepy!
Bring a book!
Could we use your phone for spotify (or gps?). Leaving now
Thank you for coming to Roanoke with me today!
Thank you!
That's awesome!. What are you up to?. Making Jellybean a thing?
Or should it be called Jellbean?. That way it keeps the pronnunciation?
Color one of them up!!! And make a little gif!
RAWR
I'll attack ^-^!!
I'm going to the pool at 7:30pm! Want to come?
Awesome!!. I can give you a ride, or if you want to come over for a bit afterwards you can drive!
Awesome!!!
Down in sec
Good morning!!
How is your day going?
Oh no!. My days going well!
Working out and watching Ted talks!
At the same time :D
What are you going to do?
Great!
Well let me know when you decide to start!
Nice !. Want to help keep me accountable today?
Finishing things on time!. If I tell you, then I'll be more likely to have it done when I say I will
Awesome!!! Here are my deadlines: 1:45pm finish 8 Ted summaries, getting ready/breakfast. 3:30pm finish grading Quiz 2. 4:30pm finish grading project 7. 4:50pm have all grades sent out. And then I can't estimate how long it will take to do all my Belize readings, but I'll do that afterwards!
Thanks!!
Thank you!!. Are you going out toward Kroger today?
I was just wondering if you had a reason to go!. I need to pick up a couple things and drop off my perscription
Oh cool! $. How is the gif going?
I can't wait to see the cute!!
:O I am on 5/6. I decided to do 6 instead of 8 for now
Ahh, he's upset! :P. It'd be cooler if he moved instead of just "shimmering"
Okay, finished and sent the 6 summaries! (21 ted talks to go at a later time!)
You got it!!
Need cute ^-^
Oh no, only halfway done with grading the quizzes!
But I am getting paid for it, so that's okay :P. Being thorough is good!
Are you being productive?. Is Jellbean live yet?
Neat! What's that for?
Yeah, I remember!
But what will you do with it?
Is it for a Christmas sweater? Looks a lot like yours!
Want to go with me to Kroger?
Awesome! Is picking you up at 4:30pm okay?
Yay, see you then!. Afterwards may I play with your cats for a bit?
On the way $. !*. Here!. I <3 you!
I love you!. P.S. Just calculated total spendings on Canada trip at 769.54 USD (not including the maple syrup and car scraper I got!). If you could pay 40% of it that would help a ton! 769.54 * .40 = 307.81. (40% since I know you paid for Casa Loma and the toll already). Or just $269.54, which is the excess over $500
Hi!. Sorry I missed your call!
What time is it at?
Why can't he use the tickets?
Is there anyone else who can go? Or maybe they can sell the tickets?
Or you can invite one of your friends!
Maybe you can go with Katy? Or Molly?
No, I'd be happy to go
Okay
Yes
The halftime act is Virginia Techniques!
Let me know when you are on the way
How's it going?. Did you want me to drive over instead?
Is there room to park?. Maybe I should wait until you find the tickets?
I'll just drive over.. Where should I park?
Okay.
Should I park there?
Okay. Here
No worries, I thought it would be fun too!
Sure thing!
Thanks! You too!
You too!
Really good! The grading has been finished and I have watched 12 Ted talks so far! How is talking to people and working on a gif?
That's great! Did you get some Christmas shopping done too?
Awesome, what did you get her?
Stuffed animals?
Oh cool!. Does that mean you got to go to Barnes and Noble?!
Ah, okay. No, I just like that store!
Thank you! What are you up to now?
The polar bear drawing?
Oh! How does it look?
That's cute! And oh my goodness, so sad.. I feel like I would use it after a hard test.. If it didn't have the words on it, at least :P. Something weird happens with the pixels when it expands
Ahh, okay!. The puff feel slightly too early too.
What do you mean by which other ones I need?
Oh right!. I will let you know
Good night!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEDgtjpycYg
Eep, what's wrong?
How are you?
Good!. What is on store for you today?
What are your indefinite plans then?
Neat! Which ones are you hoping to finish today?
Whoa painting?
What is the painting of?
Okay!. Good luck with all of those!
I am planning to tear apart my room once again and get donate more things I don't need, work on musical things, workout as usual (is mentioning this the same as mentioning that I am brushing my teeth or something? :P), reading for Belize, and making an Android app.
Thank you! Same for you
That sounds like fun! Which day?
Tuesday is good then!. I'm free anytime that day
Oh, should we do our exchange at the duck pond?
How will we run around if we are carrying presents?
Okay!
Looking forward to it.
If you'd rather
If you want.
If you want to leave your gift in person, then do so.. And you can think whatever you like.
I think this is a bad way of interacting and you're making your own assumptions and I'm not going to do anything about it because I feel frustrated with you.
Why are you hurt by me? What does that mean?
Why don't you think I'm giving any effort to "see you or talk things out"?
How have I been scare?. scarce*
How have I "avoided" you?
Did you ever ask to talk to me or be around me?
Are you referring to on Washington Street yesterday or another time too?
When did you ask to talk to me or be around me today? Because I wouldn't say that you did.
A valid suggestion, but you didn't ask me anything and I don't recall you initiating conversation either.
How did you initiate conversation?
I missed your Good morning, but when you sent something else I responded
Or when someone sent something. And it made messenger pop up
I don't remember having to respond to many thing today. What did you want to ask?
That was just one of the tedtalk's I felt like I benefited from, so I wanted to pass it's usefulness along.  I don't like to correct you and especially do not like to when I am wrong. What I would like you to do in those cases is inform me with legitimate sources/evidence so that I can be correct.
I'm more motivated to get you to use evidence when you think you are correct. I think it's crazy to think a certain way and not have any basis/backing for it.
Which instances are you describing in which I upset you?. Things anyone learns are not always correct.. Even in school.. They should always be verified because things that we think we know are not always correct either.. The same goes for me.. "anyone". Probably one of those "do as I say, not as I do" things, since I am still working on this.. In most conversation, you don't just ask people for facts though, most of the time you go along with it (unless you think you know something contrary), and then look it up later after your conversation.
I did think it was crazy. There are a lot of crazy things about the government that I don't know. I didn't know whether Richard Nixon was actually impeached either and I was going to look it up my next chance.. Then I would let you know too, once I looked it up
That's good that you know. I'm glad you could inform me
Then my mistake.
Sounds good.
The chance to do what?
Okay. Well just let me know when you'd like to do something.. Is Tuesday still on?. I wasn't sure what time you had picked.
Okay.
I want to too.
Hmm, sounds like we have a predicament then.
And I've said that I do.
Then I guess I just don't fit your idea of regular behavior.
I'm not sure what to say to that because it doesn't leave much room for a response.
What sort of response were you hoping for?. Okay.
I'll save it for Christmas
Okay, thanks!
Wait, so is Tuesday still on?
Okay.. Why are your feelings hurt?
Could you direct me where to find it? I missed it the first time.
I thought we talked it out and it was resolved?. What still makes you feel hurt?
What still makes you feel hurt? What wasn't resolved?
An effort to do what? I'm trying to talk things out right now like you mentioned.
I was waiting for you to ask me, so I guess it's a Catch 22.
I don't recall you asking me. I want you to ask me because I feel like I am always the one to ask.
When did you ask me?. You asked me to the duck pond and I accepted. That's the only one I know of.. The rest were just statements.
It sounds like you're making a lot of assumptions without bothering to ask me.
What good is making those assumptions to you?
So the only thing you're saving is keeping yourself from any bad experiences?
Sometimes you have to take chances. If you can't recover from rejection, then you'll miss out on a lot!
Well if you don't ask at all then there's no chance anyway.
Why is that?
Well alright.. Anyway, how has your day been?
Why awful?
Everything alright in your family?. How was church?
I don't think it's too late.
Probably eat food and clean my room. :P
You really don't have too! I feel like you've helped everytime I've come home :P
That's okay then!. There is food here though!
Probably now since it's so late!. And by now, I mean like right now ;P
Okay!. See you soon
Hi! Good morning!. I am going to finish cleaning my room and then workout/shower. What time did you want to do things?
Probably 1 to workout/get ready and 3 hours to clean my room
Sounds good!
Thanks for the offer but you should just work on your own things!. It was really awesome having you last night though.
^-^ Aww, the cuddles. So nice. But if you do want to come you are welcome to!. Just let me know first
Just you!! (:
Yeah! Good idea!
Sounds awesomeness!. Might still be getting out of the shower when you arrive :O Should I let you know when I am out?
Actually, just come at 1:45pm and it should be fine!
On the way?
No problem! Thank you for a fun time yesterday!
I'm about to workout if you want to join me!. We can do it through video chat :P
You can come over too if you want just to workout!
Okay
You don't have to leave after that
Starting now if you want!!. Or you can come afterwards.
Oh yeah! You have to clean the fridge!
Need any assistance?
Okay!!
Would you like to come over and play a game at 5pm?
Okay!! I'll see you then!!
Also after playing, did you want to have an eBay listathon?. Bring over about 10 items you've been meaning to post on ebay!. We can take pictures and post them!
Will you ask your Dad if he wants this VHS? My mom is convinced he would want it and I would like to donate it to the Y to be recycled or something
Okay :P What were his exact words?. If you come and my mom's white car is still in the driveway, please park at the park!. Also bring your hibachi and the leftovers from yesterday if you still have them!
Yes!. 5:15pm works a bit better if you can wait a bit
Haha, well you can, but I'll still be getting dressed so you'd be on the porch longer
Okay! 5:15:then!!
Okay! Did you clean the fridge?
Oh no, do you need help with those?
Haha, it's fine but next time just give me an ETA
Oh that's fine then!!
Okay! See you then!
Okay
Yay!
That's good!!. :3. You'd be a super fun housemate!
Goodnight, taco!. Definitely!
Come please!. 12:30 at India Garden
I love you too!!. Good night!. Yay, you!!!
:3. Karaoke was so so much fun with you!!. You're up to pick the next game!
You have a ride?
Okay!! Meet us there!
Come play games with me! (:
The pro guitar :O Is that for Xbox or just ps3?
Oh, okay!. Could you bring a stapler?
Yay Thanks!!!
Oh, I don't have that one!. Anything else you want to play!
There's still the 26th night, the 27th, 28th and 29th!
Right!
So you're coming? :3
Ooh, wait are we painting? (:
What* are we painting?. Yeah, I think once my room is empty there will be room to paint!
Just get on over here :D
I don't mind if you're not all squeaky clean! :3
As you wish then ! :3. Eta?
:3
Ah, okay.. Yes, bring your laptop!
Good morning!!! Thank you (:
Aw, Merry Christmas Eve!!!!!. I love you too!
Eve eve :O
I sure will!. You have a wonderful Christmas Eve eve, now. :3
You make a nice reindeer!
^-^
Thanks, but I'm good!. How is your day going?
It's good!! We're about to go out to sushi king soon!. Is the whole family together on Roanoke?
Oh cool! (:
What activities did you guys do? (:
And eating?
There's that yummy Chinese restaurant!
No. I don't need one either,  but if it is a really nice one (red octane), my friend James could use one
Okay!
That would be cool, but I prefer just dance!
He only has 3, but I can't remember which ones
He has supernova and extreme 2, buy I can't remember the other
I think it's a lot older than the ones we've been playing
No need to get it unless you want it $. !*
Thanks though!
What about that Mario one?
Just gamecube?
Then get the dance mat you found too. Then you can play ddr all day
I'd come play if you have it at your house! You just have to ask
Okay! My phone is running low, so I won't be able to respond, but have a good time with your family! !
I love you too (:
Merry Christmas Eve!
How are you?
I'm good! Sushi king was really awesome! !! The sushi was unlimited and top notch
We will see :O
I wouldn't! Your recommendation is appreciated (:
You're appreciated too! ! (:
Yes!!!!!
I am!!. Is that going on your Web comic site? (:. ;)
:O
In some ways, I like comics better!. So static would be nice
Yeah! Or just make 2 versions
Outline?
Haha!!!. That's great
Merry Christmas!. :3. Haha, more like my carrots. !*
My bro said the eyebrow looks like a bandaid. :P
Hehe. Maybe just a line would be appropriate
I thought of an egg at first :P. You're uber cool!!!
I can't wait to see you in person :D !!!
You are the awesomeness (:
You have so many in the backlogs!. Goodnight :D
Merry Christmas!!
I just need you :3
Om nom nom!! You are in Church?
Oh yay!! I'm so glad she likes them!!!
I'm typing. Yb.this xitnh. My knuckles !!. Autocomplete saved me on that one. I mean autocorrect
Woo hook !
But I have the S4!. Christmas is going well!! We get to spend time with Gary!
I like it!!
Ahhh, so beautiful $. !******. :')
:3 You're beautiful. :P
Aw, that's okay!!. The book is important too!
I think you'll do great! (:. Super proud of you!
Yummy! Christmas dinner?
I see mashed potatoes and ham!
Yum! How is it?
Oh yeah, that was a good one!
Hi hi!. Is assassin's creed about parkour? :O
Interesting :O. I'll be back in Blacksburg by 6:30pm!
Oh that's wonderful!! (:
Oh yeah!
Hi!
Yes
Playing games would be fun! Want to play rock band with proguitar?
I want to come!
When are you free?
I think I can drive over!
Working on budgeting! Expect me there at 7:45pm!
Om nom!! (:
Okay!! I'm leaving now
Made it home!. Don't forget to open your dad's door!
I love you too!! Thank you for playing with me!!
Hello!!
Technically right now!
Technically right now! :P

I must confer first !. 12:45 I will go over!
I'll update you in 10 minutes after conferring  $. !**. Yes, I can take the car! $. Should I eat lunch before coming?

How long will you take to eat?
Okay!! 1:05pm?
On the way now!

Hug you too! ^-^. :3. I lub you!. Good night!
Good morning!

Oh good!! (:. I love you!!!
Hi! ! (: I'm awake :O
...!
Hello late squash!
Hi!
Are you planning to come still?
Yes!
I have to do some reading for maybe up to 2 hours, so maybe bring a book or something to work on!. Maybe.. :P. And your duffel just in case!
Oh!!. Could you park in the back. My mom is leaving at 10:15
Wow you're so awesome!!. Hold on a bit though
30 seconds!. Missed the flight :(
5:30 cutoff. I'll rebook
Yes please
Has to be at another airport. No other flights today here
Yes. To the park. Waiting by the door!. Thank you for accompanying me and helping me pack!
Yup! Wow, have still not boarded yet. I love you too!
Just a regular one!. Wow I feel like I totally could have made it yesterday if I had snuck through security
Nah. I could've made it :O
Have a Happy new Year's eve!
(:
Yay
Boarding now!
Awesome!
I love you too! I will ^-^. Leaf cutter ants!!!. Also happy new year!
Want to see?
Yes!
Just in the class room!
I'm going to go shower!
Thanks!
Sweet dreams to you too!! I love you so so much!
Happy New Year!
I hope you are too!
Your copy? :3
Oh yay!!
Went bird watching early, spent time outside logging, had two lectures by Colin Young, went on a trail hike and are going to the zoo next!. What about you?
Neat!
I'm looking forward to seeing it too!
Good morning!
Hmm, what's that? Looks scary.. Toto is cute!. My favorite part was the zoo!!
Oh yum!. What were you up to today?. (I'm going to shower/sleep, but I'll read it in the morning)
I don't think that's boring if you enjoy it!. Sounds like you're having fun!. Ooh, the good witch?. Sweet dreams!. I love you!!
Your book?!
Elephant!! (:
Oh it's you!! How are you?
Awesome!
:3
I'm really good!!. Just had the craziest fun
https://youtu.be/BJAwvSrzdRM. I haven't listened to the audio, but we did this Caving trip! !
What are you doing in 30 minutes?
I just wanted to video chat with you if the WiFi allows!
Okay! :D
I come back Friday the 13th at 11:30pm ish
It's lucky in the Mayan world
Because I'm one hour behind here :P
Eep, sorry to keep you waiting!
I did some laundry as well
Oh okay!
Well nice talking to you!
You're fine!
Oh thanks!
Why is that?
I did
Okay
Nah, I guess it just wasn't good timing
Looked like you were working, plus I couldn't hear you that well
Want to watch the sunset?. How's it look?
It is!
We keep detailed logs as part of the course
Yup, but we'll get it back
If you like!
Okay, that sounds good!. Me too I hope
I love you too!
I've watched this!
Goodnight!!
Hi! Oh the bug bites are nothing to worry about (:. Haha there's a gecko in our room
Hope you're having a good day! We're about to have dinner!
Aw
Nice talking to you!
No worries!
Ttfn (:
I love you too! !
It's rain (:. Goodnight!
Good morning!!. Hope you got more sleep tonight!!
Sounds good!. I can't wait to see the new copy!
Ohh, I see!!
They were great snorkeling experiences!!. I cracked open a coconut today!
I lub you!!
Oh hi!!
Flight DL1429 Arriving ROA at 23:05
I'm not sure!
Check the flight number before leaving for updates!
How are you doing?
I am doing well! About to take the final!. Talk to you more later
It went well, thanks!!
That cool! What's going on the next few days?
Huh, what do you mean?  I thought you scheduled the next few days?
Oh all of those things sound like fun!
Of course!
Yes!
Thanks! Goodnight to you
I love you too Peter!!
Thank you! It's not departing for another 3 hours
Finishing a reflection assignment and reading!. What are you doing today?
Best of luck!
Made it to Atlanta!. I like chickens and sea lions!
Oh awesome!!
It's a 5 hour wait time and I will read Anna Karenina
No, departs 9:36pm
No, I'll arrive 11:05pm. DL1249
That's Tampa to New York
I just thought you wouldn't seen the incorrect locations and known it was wrong?. Plus different times
That's the boarding time. ?
I'm arriving 11:05pm, that's the wrong flight
Super confused why you have 10:18pm. Just Google DL1249
Okay
It's not problem,  I just expected you would Google the flight before leaving in case anything changes
Cool
Up to you!
If you have things to get done then stay home!
I think it'd be good for my mom to have company on the way to Roanoke though. It's up to you
Yes, I'd be fine either way!
No, I'll get to see you later I'm sure!
Why not comforting?
I want to see you, but practically speaking, it's not essential for you to come; I can wait another day to see you
Thank you
What is your dinner today?
Yum!
How did cleaning your room go?
Aw, what was the biggest challenge?
Awesome!!. There is beautiful live piano music here  :O. Also, accidental click
The smiley with heart eyes
And there will be less to do later when you move out!
Oh noo. :P
:( why is that?. And which stuff?
Yeah, their lifestyle could be so much better with a roomy house, right?
That's a valid reason and goal!
Yeah, they have to be ready for it. :O. I have Googled house guides. Hoarders *
It is. It should be now!! (;
It just takes a couple weekends if they are willing to part with a lot without wanting anything in return. Because selling it would be much harder
A game plan wouldn't hurt either
And then.. what do you do in the room?. It's easy to turn into moving things between rooms if you don't have a set of rules!
Too strict--some things could just be in the wrong room. It's just a lot harder than it sounds and needs some methodical process
https://www.google.com.bz/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/hoarding/comments/16kavd/ive_cleaned_up_after_two_hoarders_heres_how_i_did/. Sounds pretty impossible if your parents aren't in on it though :O. And like committed
Would showing them the article help?. There are some really important tips in there that they may not be able to handle
Keep - "Keep" is defined as stuff that is actually used on a regular basis. If you look at something and say to yourself "I might use this", "I could use this", or "I'm gonna use this", it does NOT go into this pile.. I'm pretty sure the majority of items in your house do not fit in this category. I'm sure it would have to be adjusted to include essential  sentimentals
I bet the quantity of items used on a regular basis is 5% of total items
:O
Incorporate OHIO as you sort: "Only Handle It Once". The moment you pick up an item, make the decision--Keep, Donate, Trash, Recycle--and then act on that decision by putting it in the appropriate pile. After that, the decision is made, and you don't have to worry about it anymore. Let it go, and move on.
Could be your part time job too if you diligently post things on ebay and get a commission
If you do it right, you could make as much as you would working at Kroger
Whoa,  you got the job?
That's awesome!! You should take it
I definitely. You said you can still do other stuff while you're working? That's the best job and the commute is nothing. I bet it wouldn't make much difference on your resume one way or another, and you wouldn't get much experience at the print center?. Also flexible hours at Frosty Parrot since it isn't a corporation with lots of paperworj. k*. Plus quicker training time. What were your thoughts?
Could even sell stuff on eBay while working at the Frosty Parrot!. Right next to USPS
But maybe Molly quit for a reason...
It's up to you! I'd say the commute time is not worth it for a part time job, and how much experience would you actually be getting? Did Virginia learn a lot at the print center?
Only seems to make sense if you want to be a future print shop operator?
Do it!
It's your life. Aka do what you think is best,  not what I think is best. And what you want to do
Just wanted to ask questions to get you thinking
Then sorry
I appreciate you!
Sounds great!
Nope, I'm so so full from that dinner!!!. Thank you though!
So full
First world problems
Or if you're really hungry but just too lazy to go get food
From the last plane
It's dark already ;0
Neat!. I made it, Let me know when you're outside!
Okay!
Hehe
Yay! Picking up my bag and then I'll be out there at arrivals. Thanks for lending it, by the way!
Arrivals or kiss and fly?
Yay! Still looking for the bag :3
Goodnight!!
Okay great!
No thanks!
You too!
Thank you, I hope you enjoy your Saturday too!!
Thanks
Aw, sad smiley
You too!
Wait, what do you mean?
Okay, thanks,  but that's an odd thing to say
Why wouldn't you?
I do care!
Hey cool!
Purple wins?
What other toys did you find?
Just learn from the missed opportunities, I guess!
Doesn't count for anything if you don't follow through!
That's a keeper
That's okay!
I was expecting to spend time with you too. Not sure what changed
Several attempts to what?
Did you though?  It seemed to me like you were just sadly acceptant
Oh I know you're pretty fun! If I had a place of my own I would invite you over with less hesitation. I think I'll just get to sleep shortly!
Yeah!
What's wrong?
That's a shame!
Why isn't it important to you?
Err, why do you assume things about me?
And has that helped you?
What can I do differently?
Goodnight!
Thanks!
I'm not interested. How did your day go today?
Keep doing what?
I'm sorry. I'm just not up for playing Rockband tomorrow.
Give up on what?
So you plan on shunning me?
Isn't it okay to not want to do something for a few days?
I haven't told you any reason, just more of the same.
You already know I don't want to, but you still don't know any reason
I mean you weren't getting any new information to comment on, maybe you were just looking at it differently.. I don't really have a reason, I just don't feel like it.
Please stop making assumptions about what I want or don't want.
That doesn't mean I want to discontinue all contact.
Thank you. There's nothing wrong with mentioning you are sad though!
Goodnight
https://www.google.com/amp/thoughtcatalog.com/jamie-varon/2014/04/a-relationship-will-not-make-you-happy-so-stop-looking-for-happiness-there/amp/. Happiness is within, Peter!
And the sadness helps you grow and learn things about yourself. It's a choice, not something you are forced into
Why not?. Not in agreement with some part?
Again, that's your assumption
Why so negative? You have everything to offer, but if you think you have nothing, then it will be so
Haven't you learned to love yourself first?
You should make that a priority. Love yourself.
If you don't think you're worth the love then you don't know yourself. I like this article too. All good things. That's the last one for today, I hope they are helpful!. Still stuff I need to remind myself.. There were days in middle school when I called myself a loser everyday. I've come a long way!
Maybe this can be helpful too? Yay advice columns :O ?. Not saying any of this is you, but it can help to synthesize a ton of different opinions on the Web to figure things out
Eep, I've said too much :O
Yeah, that's makes sense. Well sorry I couldn't be that person
Sure. I was just feeling down today and just napped after getting home.
Probably from sleeping in, or maybe introverted withdrawal from being around people nonstop for two weeks. Or perhaps hopelessness over learning about losing conservation efforts. Or maybe lamenting my lack of company now that the trip is over. Who knows.
Your company is great.. I'm going to get to sleep now so I can start tomorrow fresh!. Goodnight!
Good morning!
I'm good! How are you today?
I haven't made my plan for the day yet! What about you?
Thanks! Enjoy church. What was last week's topic?
How about the week before?
You're not disappointing
What's your next art endeavor since you've finished the Wizard of Oz?
Any other pursuits on your mind?
That's fine then. Have any neat dreams lately?
Okay, well I'll let you get to church then!. Ttfn!
Hmm, okay! Did you make a decision on which job you're going to go ahead with?
Neat, which one?
Okay. Well I hope it goes well.
What's not working for you?
I'm up for meeting in person and talking
You never asked.
Would you want to meet at Starbucks or some where else?
Okay, just let me know when you get back from church.
I may have to go to Christiansburg to sell something on Craigslist, but should be free other than that
Okay, I'll let you know. What time would you be back from church?
Take your time. Did you want to meet at 1pm then?
Okay, see you then!
It's pretty crowded
I don't want to bother my Mom much either!
I guess your house would be find too if you'd prefer there!. fine*
I'm thinking!. Hmm, maybe your house because cats!
Mmm, that sounds yummy!
Ah, maybe let's not do anything. I'll just hang out at home. How about tomorrow?
I just feel guilty leaving my mom home alone watching TV all day. Definitely not healthy
It's okay. I understand
How was the church lunch?
What is there to say?
I don't agree at all.. (Except for the things that I can't agree/disagree with, like how you said you are feeling)
What relevance does that phrase have in a messaging app?
I just don't feel like hanging out today. I'm sorry.
It depends on whether you want to listen, or just assume things.
I feel like this is quite the overreaction for just not wanting to see you a couple days. I think your negative reaction the first day is part of the reason for me being less inclined to see you today. I think it's ridiculous to say you'll never see me again if we don't see each other today or tomorrow. You don't have a job at the moment, so it seems like you can easily come visit if you wanted. I was planning to spend spring break with you if you wanted. We haven't had a real conversation in quite the while and most of it just feels one sided with you assuming the worst without any intervention.
That's your assumption.
I did manage to pop the hood and no news back from Craigslist guy.
You can't delete our messages! They are in the cloud!
It would be fantastic if it snowed 2 feet tonight and then we could play in it tomorrow!
Haha, but it'd be special sky ice.
Wow, I don't think I've ever played in mud before.. I think it would be fun to practice soccer skills by keeping a soccer ball up
Oh it'd be awesome if I could have one of your soccer balls!!
2 would be good, that way you can try too!!
Today!
Okay!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txr2YQzsLDU. Yes I have one!. Watch this so we are on the same page
Bring all the activities!
Who knows... :O. Dun dun dun
Did you find the soccer balls? (:
Soccer today!
Found the pump!
Yes!
Right now!
(:
I love you too!. Still burrito!. :3
Come and bring cake!. Wait what kind of cake?
Ohh, okay. Nah, no cake then :P
Just you!
Your play clothes!
For more soccer practice! And yes, that couldn't hurt
Neat! No thanks though!. Lots of sweets here
Come play (:. I mean... take your time (:. Also feel free to stop by the bank on your way to setup your online account and whatnot. Oh wait, they are closed :'(
Gloves perhaps?
Maybe maybe! !
Good morning! !
:D!!. I can't wait to see you for cooking today!!
9 is good! You can always use my shower if you don't get the chance :P
Finishing up the list! I'll let you know when I leave here
Heading over now!!. If you have 1-3 extra muffin tins, that would be awesome too!. I'm awake!
Eep That's okay! I'll try to be on time to your house!
It would!
It's looking more like 6am, but we will see!!
I will! Sorry to keep you up!
I love you too!!. On the way. Here
Thank you! !. I am safe in Cville taking on classes!
The food survived!  (:. It is yummy!!
Yay!. :3 Off to Cooperative autonomous systems!
I hope you are having a great day!! What are you up to today?
Oh no, late start! I woke you up too early :P
Does this comic perhaps involve cake?
Just a guess!
Let me know if you find any coconut popsicle ! :3. No, just my mom, the dessert pusher :P. Cheesecake!
Nah, it will just be one strip in your collection!. Hehe, I'm excited to eat the coconut shrimp again ^-^. I'll have to ration them
It's true!!. But I am determined to make it last until spring break.
Hehe :P I will need to make more breakfasts eventually, but I have enough dinners for the 6 weeks. And I'm not sure about the shakes.
I made about 36 breakfast bags, so I'll be 6 days short.. Oh, but I have the 2 extra oatmeal containers!. So I'm good. Just need to supplement with greek yogurt
http://happymoneysaver.com/making-50-freezer-meals-in-one-day/. Now I can make my own blog post too. Yum, almond butter!
Hehe, yes please ^-^
That was us!. I didn't take any pictures though :P. I'll have to document the next time I do it!!
I forgot to put my engine cap back on after pouring oil'-- is it possibly in front of your house?
Yes, but I bet it fell out. I haven't taken a look at it yet, but I drove the whole way without the cap on and I think it messed up my car :O
Thanks for checking!
No worries, I'd only check going around the corner maybe, but anywhere else would be too hard
Haha, don't worry about looking any more. I'll just buy a new one if it's not there
Okay! What brand is your snorkeling gear?
I found one on amazon for $8 Could you send mee your link?
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8N3BY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER
I'll try Amazon that way they deliver
No, but I think the return policy is good! I'll order it today so it comes next week. Aw, I guess this means I can't drive it in the meantime though
Maybe Amazon prime.. :P
My sister does, but I don't want to bother her for it again.. I can wait!
Noo. :P. I'm off to class!. Ttfn
Is there anything you need or think I  need from amazon?. I need $35 more worth of things. Maybe Lara bars?
Not that I can think of! Lara bars it is!!
Are you free to talk?
Cap is there!! I just need to go get oil in the morning
Yeah :P I think I'll just let it sit
Me too!! Hopefully the engine will be okay running dry for a bit
Nah, I'll just run it dry. I think you're the same way.
Wouldn't want to ask if it's not essential
I put the cap on top of the engine, so it was held in place well, fortunately!!
Yeah!. I'm all set for bed now!
Hooray (:
Sleep tight!
I'll be driving to the gas station !
Sweet dreams (:
Good morning!!
Have a nice run!
It's pleasant ^-^
You can still walk with me sometime!
The sunrise is pink!!
How was the run? (:
Yay. :D!. Would you like to walk with me?
Class! (:
Yay!! Let's try the demo together next time
Me too!. When is a good weekend to come home next?
Oh thanks ^-^. Maybe next time there is a cool event
Have you had dinner yet?
I just did!. I had tomato chicken (:. The chili sounds yummy! What makes it green chili?. Oh, how was hanging out with Gap?
Oh yum!!
Hmm, are you up for another call perhaps?
Oh yay!! Is 9:10 okay?
I chose to talk to you.. Haha, you look very enthused.
Are those cucumbers?
I like talking to many different people because each person has a different perspective to learn from.
More creepy
It looks good when I cover up the chin though!
Are you saying it is more realistic this way?
That looks worlds better
Oh, that looks great!. Good job!
Two can play at sarcasm, Mr. Realistic
:3 It's mem. Me?*
:'3. It's beautiful!
No, it really is!!
I love you!!. Sweet dreams!
Good morning!!
It's going really well! I had two classes, brunch with Tanul and company, and next I'm going to the ice rink and then breakdance practice. How about yourself?
Neat!
I thought it was funny :P
Wow, that's great!!
Tanks?. Figurines or clothing?. Or simulator?
Oh I see! Part of police training?
Hi! May I call you?. Or still hanging out?
Sneak away!
Hehe
Sorry, ready for a call now!. Or tomorrow maybe
Goodnight Peter!
I hope you are too!
Just had brunch with Quest bridge scholars and next is figure skating, then breakdancing, then homework until sleep!. What about you?
Awesome! ! Keep it up!
Yeah! I've been playing piano the past 2 days too!. It's not everyday you get to have a piano in your house $. !**
I mean an upright piano $. !*. Oh no why dollar sign
I'm surprised!. Since it seems you have one of everything
Sure!. I just have a class 12:30-1:45pm
Possible meeting at 3:30pm, but it hasn't been planned yet, so I can avoid it!
I'm sure
That sounds great!
They were great!!
Coconut shrimp!. And maybe!!
Thank you! What are you doing?
How many were you expecting?. Still for the Wizard of Oz?
As long as you're working your hardest, that's fine!
Don't worry about me, just worry about yourself. Is having me around is doing you any good?. Around doing*
I am just asking you if you feel like I am helping you or not, because you seem to be worried about disappointing me or being judged by me a lot
No. I just think you should evaluate whether I have a positive influence on your life, and if not, something should change
We could decide that together
It would be good because why would you have a girlfriend if they are not making your life better?. If there's a problem, you don't just live with it, you fix it
What does that mean as far as your long term happiness?
What about our relationship though? Do you like it? Why would you want to continue it?
Do you think I am a positive influence on your life? If so, why?
Hmm, what will you do about it?
Also, on a side note, did you pay me for the Canada trip already?
How much was it again?
Eep, I remember it was much more
307.18. you're good. I was remembering the total value :O
Still okay to go on a Spring break trip too?. I can try and budget it so it's only $750 a person if possible!!. Plane tickets are through my miles, so it's not like real money anyway. :P
You found out the openings?
Oh good!. I'm sorry about the Printing job though :(. Did you check any other print shops?
You never know until you check!
Sounds good!
Thank you!. Piano first!. I'm making Bok Choy Soup!
Yup!!. Thank you (:
No worries!. Want to go to the Bahamas between May 9th and May 20th?
My best bet for Spring break so far is Athens, Greece for $800 each. Hmm, this is tough :O
Or Turks and Caicos.. hmm. Thanks!
Saint Lucia?
I'm up for anywhere, I've just been checking flight + airbnb prices and then adding them up. If you have a place feel free to do the same!
I'm not sure, check it out!. If you want
Grand Cayman
Settled in where?
Just planning a trip. How was your time with Gap?
That's neat!. Sous vide. What was the movie?
What was the movie about?*
Oh interesting!
Neat!. Was it one of the episodes we hadn't seen yet?
It's okay! I'm not sad, it just reminded me to check for Warrior Cats movie/TV updates. All I found was a fan made short episode form :P
Who knows when it will be released!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7fm-_cuxfA
You should read the books ;)
No :P You should read it. Unless you need to watch it for intrigue. I already did :P
Sound good
?
sounds*. Sorry, I'm brushing my teeth. Do you have a problem with me?
No, I was just confused why you keep making sad faces
That doesn't look so happy either
I am focused though
You are forgiven
Goodnight!. Good morning Peter! I hope you have a good time a church!. (if you are going to church)
I am catching up on homework today, will finish reading a book, and will probably play the piano a bit and play with the soccer ball if it's not raining. Plus laundry!. What about you?
Cool! I hope you have a good day. What is the comic idea?
I look forward to seeing it!. What is happening at church today?
Rawr :3. I want to play with you today!
Wii Tennis would be fun!
It will have to be next time I see you!. Unless you can make a controller holding robot and sync it to the arrow keys on my keyboard :P
Oh yeah!. I made a list of all the things I have to sell with expected profit for each item and it was over $1000 worth of things!. You should see how much all the stuff in your room could make you too!
Okay!. ready to play?
http://forum.curvefever.com/play2.php?cluster=2&joinid=6OWCJ-0. Whoops, someone else joined. Try this one http://forum.curvefever.com/play2.php?cluster=2&joinid=6OWCJ-1
Oh okay!
Yay!. I've never played before, so I have a backup just in case!
Still here!. http://forum.curvefever.com/play2.php?cluster=2&joinid=6OWCJ-2. Made another. Password is your name
password is "Peter". Guest 9429. http://armorgames.com/play/15699/tiny-tanks?tag-referral=multiplayer
Please come back soon and play with me :3
Whoops, my computer restarted :O
One last game? ^-^
Yeah !. Back in action!
Still here!. Yay (:. No, I'm just quiet. Because my roommate got back!. hehe. Thank you!!. hehehehe. Oooh, what is it?
I love you too!!. Ready?. Kisses?. :3. I meant start round though :P. But the banana collection..!. Om nom. Who is our market?. They sure are loaded. :O Do we need it? Can we handle it. ?. *. Sun temple absorb sun temple?. Will it help?. That's what we thought last time.. But this time we have unlimited monies :P. Aw, R.I.P. Tech Terror. Yay!. Aw. Time to orchestrate sun temple #2 on your side of the screen!. Once we build up 200k. You may have to sell things to fit it in there. But not the banana farms!!. But the banana farms are in range. Gotta do it elsewhere. I think where your bomb cannon is. The MOAB destroyer. Out of range of banan farm?. Yay!. What's up now?. Need to eat food?. Or grab a bowl?. :3 I'll be here for you. Om nom nom. Nom nom :3. Oh goodness. *clap clap*. Yay!!. Time to rebuild the Navy!. Okay!. I'll wait for you mostly. Yay!!. What did you get to eat?. Yay!!. Aw man, I miss you so much. Can't wait 2 more weeks. No, not the food. Just having fun with you! (:. I mean having fun with you makes me miss you more!. (:. The Navy!. Om nom nom. Good question!. Yeah1. !*. Yay!. I ate it all ;)
200K?. 50k?. how much?
Wow!. Ray of Doom :O
(hug). Ahh, so much cash :P. Oh no :P It's evil. oh no evil!. Which episode is that?. Or is that a fan made?. Wow, so many funds!. Oh, what's that? :3. Oh, aw :3. Forever!. Not much!. Oh house meeting!. Be right back!!. Is there a way to save?. hehe ;P. You can keep playing in the mean time. :P
Oh noooo
Hi!
Wow, it looks like I'm still in the game in solo mode, but it's super frozen
Probably should sleep :P
:3 Sorry to take up your whole day!
Aw ^-^
I had a great time with you too! You are a very cool potato!. Sweet dreams (:
:3 I love you
Good morning!
Thank you!! I hope you have a really great day too, Peter! (:
Rawr!. (That means hi and I love you)
Hehe. How goes the day's events?
Really well! (:
Good morning!! Wow, the staples in Christiansburg?
Awesome! I hope you get it
I love you!! (:
Thank you! I hope you are too!!
Aw, well I hope you get the job that you want!
Why is that?
Well the first problem sounds easy to fix (or like a Catch 22)!. The second one requires more work. literally.. Do you know what your goal is? (What job you want to appeal to?). It seems like your resume will depend a lot on that.
I've seen a lot of talk on the web that graphic designers are losing out to user experience and web designers. What do you think?. Do you want to be graphic design for sure?
If so, you should try to get some clients that way you can put real experience on your resume.. Or just craft your school assignments as if they were clients and put that experience on your resume.
Make sure all your logo work is displayed on your portfolio. Make sure each of your projects is clear on your resume.
Hi hi!
What's the haps? :3
Whoa, have you moved since earlier?
I am working on a lab!. For Vision and Language. Turns out I am TAing again this semester :P
I agreed to it today!. It was pretty fun last semester, so I think I will like it again (:
The first Cloud Computing TA :O
hehe. So how's yours look after all the work?. Please take me for a walk!. :P
Rawr!. What did you eat today?
Yummy!. What else did you eat?
Oh no, are you on a hunger strike?. :(. What is wrong?
Resume improvement is not that captivating :O. Playing Minecraft?. And cannot get up?
Wow, that's intense.
I'll leave you to it!. Goodnight ^-^
Okay!. How is the weather today?
Oh neat! What was your last run like?
Oh good! :D What is your target mile time?
Oh good! Do you feel healthier?
That's good!1. Why only a little bit though?
So progress is slower because you are already quite fit?
Do you think running will help>. ?*
Oh good!. Which scenes did you illustrate today?
Thanks for using PDF!
You should probably put more important skills higher up. Like for Book Design, book binding is probably the least important, so it should go at the bottom of the section. The last 2 bullets should likely go at the top!. (For Book Design, I mean). You should mention the name of the Social Media sites you worked on. Under animator, you should quantify what a "tight deadline" was. Maybe the time you spent to make it vs how long the film is?. If it would help, also quantify how many screenplays, etc.. you have made. illustrations is spelled wrong under Frosty Parrot
First Place for Publications in the Spring Design Show ( needs more description ). like "Radford University Art Association?"
Probably write that out if there is space. Same with AIGA 2nd to bottom. Not everyone knows what that is.
The format of your Poster Design should likely be the same as the others.. The American Institute of Graphic Arts
I mean the Poster Design section should just list the names of the places you designed for. If you want it to be more uniform. Also, on your website, it is difficult to navigate between Design, illustration and animation without hitting the back button and the top nav bar takes up too much of the screen.. At least in my resolution.. Nice job working on these!
The resume
Okay
No, definitely include it, but also include the names of their organizations. You should also include the other projects you've done since graduating
You know better than I!
That's all you've done as far as job relevant work since May?. I thought you were working on lots of art projects
It seems like that's all you do every day!
You should list anything that you've been working on!
To show that you are actively designing. I'm going to get to sleep now!. Any other questions?
Be as specific as possible
Yup
More specific is better
That's fine. Any other questions?
Then start a blog and list it on your resume. A comic blog. And list your published Wizard of Oz book
Take it out and put it under your freelance work. Yup, saying it's available on Amazon would sound impressive too. I think it should go in the order of Designed, illustrated, and published. Maybe word that so it doesn't sound like an advertisement. And just Amazon is fine. Good night, Peter!
No problem. Get Mr. Kaylor to edit it
I can't spell his name
It's up to you.. Goodnight!
I love you too!. Any mobile or Web work would be a plus
Take off less important stuff
Good morning!
How are you today?
Neat!
I'm doing well!
Awesome! Where have you been searching from?
You mean on Sunday?
I thought that was nice too (:. Oh just now?. Sarcasm?
Aw ^-^. I was really wanting to talk to you last night, but you seemed a bit busy
No worries! I will be pretty busy tonight
What's the most interesting job listing you've seen in your searches?
What do they have in common?
Hmm, what are the common wanted skills?. Adobe CC?
Oh interesting!. Are you eating more food today?
Awesome! Eating is fun!. What did you eat today?
Sounds good!. Well, not really
No, I'm glad to be rid of those items!. Next time hopefully I can just give them away instead of feeling like I must eat them!. Or do more careful rationing
I got healthy snacks instead (:. Nuts (pistachios, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, oh my), greek yogurt, and baby carrots!
I love you too!!. Beep
Can you accept a short call?
I love you!!
Keep up the good work ^-^
Thanks! It's a bit later than I thought so I'm going straight to sleep instead (:
Aw thanks!. Good morning! I hope you have the perfect day!. I just bought my first share of stock :D !. It's super volatile, so I'm already at $1.02 profit :P I'll probably wait a year to sell though. $1.11... wow, so fast. $1.15.. Okay I'm going to stop watching now :P
It was in the span of a minute :P
Yeah! It's Amazon stock!. I think I will buy more! But once a week because I heard that will help average out things
Want to talk on the phone with me? (:
Yum, hot chocolate!!
It is!
Still exciting!. Like water!. Yum ^-^
Aw cute ^0^
It was good  (:
You can om nom  all things!
You heard it from me!. Om nom nom
Goodnight, Peter!
Good morning!
I hope you do too!
Oh man, that's rough!. What was your expected time per illustration and what has been the actual?. Well best of luck with the rest!
Good job :D Sounds like you have been working hard
It's been really good!. How about yours?
Wow, good job with all the illustrations!! Is the end goal to have a picture book?
Save our logo!. Needs help :O
Yes, but the gradient is not going to work for vectorizing. And the text is too unreadable
I think they want it to be light shafts
Could you resend?
Not sure.. I guess similar to now but much more readable
If you want to!. How many chapters are there?
Oh good!
Up to you!. I don't know
Not sure
Could you resend the other one?
Thank you!. Cute manatee, by the way!
I love you too!!. You don't even have to make it if you don't want to!
Anytime
Sweet dreams! (:. Feel free to change it up if you are inspired
Hmm, I actually prefer the original to the "cleaned up" one. Most of it is probably the bricks looking too new, and the banner being to square at the top though. But you did say you'd do more work on it, so I'll hold my comments!. Thank you :3. Looks like they are on the case though!
Haha, I think it's a torch!
Good morning!
Well thank you for the previous designs! Maybe I just have to believe :D
Back the the Wizard of Oz then? :D. Do you alternate watercolor and drawing?
Glad you think so!
I am working on a mobile app project and practicing breakdancing!. What about you?. Actually, would you be able to add Sol to the start of the Tower logo you made?. And also Games at the end if possible?. (but not as important as sol
Whichever one you want
Just add it somewhere before "Tower". The only Tower logo
It says Tower and nothing else
Yup!
What do you mean?. Just make it as if it were the final logo that says Sol Tower, or optionally, Sol Tower Games
No problem!
That looks pretty cool! I feel like it's missing the knight-type feel that people's other proposed logos have had though
No, just the feel. This one feels more blocky and modern. Also, I liked the silhouette type thing you had going on, and the ballustrude on the R. *ballustrade/crenellations. crenelated*. But if you could do some variations, that would be great!. Also, thank you!
I think it still looks more modern than rustic.
I think the sun font and clean black outlines. What do you think?
I guess I meant that it is too dark of an outline. I'm not sure what to do differently, but I don't like this one.. Any other ideas?. Hmm
Hehe
It's very different
The sun idea was neat!
I'm not sure. It could be the sun flares too
Is that font serif?
I'm super not sure.. As a last thing, could you add the R top to logo 1?. Thank you!. Could you try a different yellow? Or different background color?. It's a bit of a contrast.. Sorry the last thing wasn't really the last thing!
Thank you so much! I really like the last one too!. Oh neat! Thank you!
Oh Interesting!. Is it iconic enough though?. I've noticed all the popularest logos are simple
No, I meant simple like logo simple.
https://www.google.com/search?q=logo&espv=2&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS653CL653&biw=1366&bih=589&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIrd_a1ubRAhVDySYKHQr5Cu0Q_AUIBigB
Sometime tomorrow, could you do the updated mini-logo?. Like just one icon. Thank you again!
No, just the smaller version of the logo. *doesn't know what favicon means*. (But, yes. The favicon)
The favicon
The possibilities are endless.. Whichever looks better.. Aim for simple with this one, probably.. Based on the yellow gray one you sent
Not the new one.. P.s. the flag makes the O look like a Q. In the black one
I love you! Thank you for all the help!
I think so!. The more the merrier though!
Why biased?. Also sleep tight!
Waddles!. Meep
Haha, which episode was that?
Oh interesting!. Plz make Bear n Bear now
Which storyboards do you have so far?
Oooh, may I see?
That's okay ^-^
Oh neat! I'd love to see how you handle the background and other details!
Thank you! I think favicons are typically 16x16 though?
It's good! I just used this site. http://www.favicomatic.com/
You're good! I bet this is faster than you having to shrink it and save it 3 times
Yes, I'm sure!
I need you to make the first episode of Bear and Bear in storyboards!
Oooh, you have snow? :O
My mom said there was snow!
We do not have snow!
It has been really good!
How has your day been?
http://creatingbeautifully.com/30-growing-places-artists-make-passive-income-online/. You should list some of your art on a website so people can buy digital prints of it!. Once it's listed, you mostly just forget about it until someone buys one!
Also, where is that page for Jellybean the Pig?
A page so the Pig can get its limelight. And become famous!
You do!. You have a website.. Just start a wordpress or blogspot for the pig
Use WordPress, make a little app--put it on your website domain, and then do marketing and make a Facebook page for the pig, and Boom, franchise.
Just gotta do something!. All the guides are online :O. But that's my vision. What's your vision?. Bear n Bear as a Youtube hit?. Wizard of Oz Picture Series Blog?. Just gotta make it...
Become the next Sarah Anderson or Allie Brosh. Just need iconic little comics.
Start the website tomorrow, and then just post one thing a day ^-^. Is that something you want to do/have been meaning to do?
Do some research on popular webcomics and platforms.. I just researched Sarah Andersen's and she posts ad-free free webcomics on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, gocomics.com, tapastic.com, and  sarahcandersen.com.. It looks like she makes money off of side projects and this attempt on https://www.patreon.com/SarahsScribbles. So that's one model you could use (ad free webcomics) -- just use these to gain popularity and notoriety, and then hopefully people will commission you if you do well.. Or if you do well, then start making ads is another option.. The first option would be start out with ads, which would only be really good foresight if one of your things happened to go viral, but it only lasted for two days or something.. The last option**. So there you have it.. Now you have everything you need :D. Also, do you know how to add another subdomain on your website?
If not, that's okay, but you could learn and have a homepage along with all your other mediums.. Or you can skip that for now and just use platforms if the activation energy is preventing you from posting anything.. Wait, is this something you were interested in doing, or not?. It wasn't very clear.
Haha, sounds like something I should be doing since I am so interested in your potential.. I'm just not an artist, but I want to make a travel blog!. travel/adventure. Maybe we can make a getting started pact. And then both do it.
Someone's got Invent Adventure on Facebook though :(
And tumblr. But it hasn't achieved greatness yet!. Maybe I can bring it to greatness. Looks like inventadventure.com is open!
I think I will go with Google Domains for my website hoster!. Which one do you use?
Neat!
http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/passive-income-ideas/. Go team!. I'll start mine this week!
Yup!
Thanks! I'll try not to ask for too much help with that part!. Yay, just reserved twitter and facebook pages for InventAdventure. I better do youtube too?. And instagram?
Aw man, someone has the Instagram. But that's okay!
I just made InventAdventure though :D. Facebook wise. It's plain.. I will design an icon thingy!
Maybe it can be the polar bear :P
Yay, excitement!. ^-^ !
What's your webcomic called?
Is it Just Some Pita?
That is the name!. Or is it?
Oh is see.. Oh I see*. http://registration.vthacks.com/
Yes!. By MLH rules, up to 1 year out of university you can. Just put Radford University as your school
If you want!. It's always a fun time!
What were some highlights of your day today?
Homework, Taking a Quiz at OH, Learning Chinese, and reading. And the blog conception!. So did you want to make that pact with me?
Yes. A due date for our first blog post!. And a timeline of content posting from there.. To keep the momentum
That's for you to decide. I am making a more ambitious schedule :D. Since I have the extra time!
1/31 First Post  2/2 Second Post  2/3 Third Post  2/4 Forth Post  2/5 Fifth Post  2/6 Sixth Post  2/7 Seventh Post  2/10 8th Post  2/14 9th Post  And then every Friday and Tuesday from there
And my criteria is to post to Facebook, Twitter, and my website. What are your milestones and criteria?
Did you want to do Tapastic and GoComics too?
Webcomic platforms
Up to you!. So are you in?
Is this important to you?
Wait, the Frosty Parrot is open! https://www.facebook.com/frostyparrot/. You've been deceived!
How long did it take your sisters to hear back after applying?
What illustrations did you make today?
Good thing!
I'm just finishing up some homework!
Thank you!. Good night!. What are you doing? O.o
Reading assignment guidelines and about to get to sleep!
Thank YOu (:
You too!
I love you too!!
Oh thank you!. I hope you have a fantastic day too!. Platapi have superpowers
What are you doing today?
I did homework and breakfast this morning, classes from 9-2pm, OH now til 3:30pm, Hw til 5pm, Class til 6:15pm, then breakdancing practice, soccer practice, chinese practice, piano practice, branding for my blog and more homework.
I would like to design it myself, but it'd be neat if you could help me vectorize it!
Would you be able to transform a sketch into a thingy?
I can pay you for your efforts!
I think Cody should pay you too for his banner :P. Unless you did it without his request
Ohh, okay!
How long have you been cleaning?
I hope it goes well!. Don't forget you can always listen to an audiobook or something!
I love you too!. I will be ready for posting, but my website won't look very good until the weekend :P
Thanks! I still need to design though, didn't get around to it yet!
Maybe maybe!. What do said pictures look like. ?*
Ah okay!. Well I was planning on doing something else for my banner!. Sleep tight!. Time for bed ^-^
I'd opt for the original photos!. Good morning!
Thanks!
Nope!
I'm hosting Cloud Office hours. What do you need?
I love you!. Will you walk me home in a bit?
Oh good!! It's dark. Cink to your comic?. Link*
I have set aside time now til midnight to finish!. After I get home
Happy afternoon!
Thank you! Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!
I am up $25 in the stock market from my original investment!. Pretty cool!. Tomorrow should be a big change too, not sure if it will be up or down
Okay with the smiley? Yeah I am!. Good morning!. Stocks are at +$50 today :O
Just raised to $58!
It's crazy!. +$61. I should really stop checking on this :P
$63. Yeah, you're right. But wow. If I had like 200k to invest I would've just made $2400 in a week. Is it really this easy?
Oops, minus taxes
Haha, well I guess that's why the stock market trading is so crazy. In those movies
I should have started earlier :P
Yeah, but I need the money to pay off my Mom's debt, some due Feb 6th. And you should only put in money that you're willing to lose?. Well.... Hmm.. I could invest short term maybe.... Nah.... Hmm..
Oh neat! What is that?
Cool!
Just for you! :D
Probably not, but it sounds like it!
What what? :O. Did you watch Star Wars yet?
Is that the person?
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/0-100-from-no-experience-to-a-6-figure-sf-design-job-in-12-months-cd7546034077#.e6oqk9l20. Haven't read this, but the title looked relavent!
I've never sent you this, it was just published
No
Published 3 days ago
That one was about coding. This one is design
That was about doing a coding boot camp and then interviewing at a gazillion places. It's the same blog
Well give it a read (estimated 11 minutes)
I thought it would be useful nonetheless!
Depends on the job you want
Yup!. I hope your day was great too!
Haha, you should make a YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/user/Littlebabybum
Yeah, you just don't put anything on it :P. Or do you?
You should start your YouTube enterprise :P. Minecraft commentary?. Animated something?. Someone the Littlebabybum videos have millions of views :O. I guess lots of people want to entertain children.. That could be a good market. Just doing lots of internet business recently.. internet business research*
It's the doing that counts!
But did you actually try?
Trying isn't just one video, trying is making tons and tons until you eventually suceed
http://thestartupfoundry.com/2011/03/11/angry-birds-overnight-success-only-took-8-years/. If you're dedicated, you can do anything!. But you have to do the research, the marketing, and just get lucky. Sounds like you haven't been to enough motivating talks :P. http://fundersandfounders.com/how-airbnb-started/. I think you have a lot of potential! We all do really. We just need to use it. Sorry, I'll get off the soap box.. :P
How is your comic?
https://www.myportfolio.com/. My friend Albany made her website with this!. It looks really easy. To update and things. http://albanycarlson.com/projects
Sweet!. It links to behance!
Goodnight and sleep tight!
I love you too!. Has anyone done a pictogram map of blacksburg and it's major landmarks?
That could be a cool project. Maybe people would buy prints of it online to hang in their houses
Charlottesville too!. Especially if it were college focused
Like the major campus buildings. The Resident view would be totally different.. Would college kids be likely to buy something like that?. Maybe in a poster print. You'd have to do some surveys to figure out what the Hotspots at Tech are. I could give you the downlow for Cville!
I think you should choose your own projects. I'm just trying to get you thinking. You can only really succeed at something you are passionate about
That's unusual!
It's not average, but it's really good to have!!! http://liveboldandbloom.com/12/passion-in-life/passionate-people
Thank you!
I am getting some homework done! What about you?
It always does!
Yeah!
My house is good!. And nope, but I am at Dollar Tree at the moment
I haven't changed my mind. But it's not so nice here. There's no much room for sitting. not*
That's okay!
That wouldn't be very good
Yes, but I can clean up and we can do something tomorrow!
Yes, but I'm not interested, I'm sorry :(
Thanks for understanding
Thank you!. How has your day been today?
What are you up to today?
What were you doing earlier today?
Oh wow!! How is she?
That's sad :(. She should put here existence to some good use!. her existence*. Like maybe she can take up painting. Did she ever paint?
Or knitting?
Yes I do!. Want to play laser tag tomorrow at Pandapas pond?
https://www.facebook.com/events/782314591916358/
Sweet! I'll RSVP
That's okay
Cool! I just messaged Scott to see if it is okay!
Sounds better than airsoft because no brusing!. Do you have any camo I can borrow?
Neat, thanks :D!. All set for tomorrow at 1pm!
Okay!. Did you want to drive?
Okay!
Hmm, will jeans be okay?. Or hmm
Goodnight!
Thank you! What did you do tonight?
Oh!! What did you finish?
Oh, good job finishing!. How does it look?
Oh good!
Well good luck with the rest!. Did you want to meet at my house at 12:15pm tomorrow, and we will leave for Pandapas Pond at 12:30pm?. Be sure to eat lunch beforehand!
Okay! See you then! Also bring warm clothes since it will be cold and comfortable shoes and gloves (Maybe a hat?). See you tomorrow!. Also bring water!
And a snack if you want!
No, just some potential camo things (:
Still on for 12:15pm? (:
Great! See you then!
Oh definitely!. Thank you for playing laser tag with me today! I had a great time (:
I do like you!
Okay! What is fabric check?
Oh right!. Do you happen to have a beanie I can borrow?
For breakdancing
No, maybe when I come over to pick up the food!. Has the food been in the way at all?
Haha, one's that you wouldn't mind possibly getting a bit beat up
ones*
Oh good!
Oh no, where did they all go?
Neat!
Oh okay
That's no necessary! Thanks though!. not*
No. What do you mean?
Oh, I just need to get some homework done mostly.
That pretty much it! Plus my house is super messy and there's not any room for activities
And I don't feel like trying to clean it up because it just keeps getting messy everything I leave.. It might not bother you, but it bothers me.
I did, and we played laser tag!. Is there something else you wanted to do?
I bet Katy would go with you!
I don't think we need lettuce anymore!. Thank you though!
Yes, 4:20pm should be a good time! Thank you!
See you tomorrow!
I will just need 8 whole containers of smoothies, and 4 bags of dinner entrees. I can come a bit earlier and get them together!
Thanks for the heads up! Can't see much from my window, a bit pinkish
Well thank you for the thought (:
Thank you! And the same to you.
Oh I see! Are you already at Jo Annns?
I'm all set! Thanks though!
Nope, I'm all good!
No, I just don't need anything
You are not a bother
Thanks!. I was going to let you know that I'm not planning anything for Spring Break. I'm thinking of just staying in Charlottesville and programming robots!. But I'm still open to ideas!. What do you think?
I'm also thinking it'd be better to save travel money for the summer. I'm not sure I'll have enough for Bahamas + Peru/Ecuador + Malaysia + Australia + a spring break trip.. But without the spring break trip, I could make it work.. What predictions?
Do you think you would be able to help out with the Bahamas & Peru/Ecuador trip by the time it comes around?. Or would want to go on those?. That would be in May and June
Oh cool!. Maybe a good temporary plan would be to pursue UX design and try and get a job!. And then work on animation in your free time.. It seemed doable for that article guy.. He just had to work super super super hard for a year :O. Like scary hard.. But you already have skills in Photoshop so you're at an advantage!. You just need to read a lot about UX design concerning websites and mobile. Not ideal, but better than a service job!
Ooh, have you applied to any of those job positions yet?. !!!!
UX design. Also, Learn some basic CSS/Html
Hopefully the Adobe will make that easy!. Adobe portfolio*. And then if you apply to 80 UX design jobs, I bet you you will get at least one interview!
Just take 3 full days to learn CSS/HTML and 3 full days to study UX design, then 6 days creating mobile and website mockups. Also display your puppet website and also your Annabelle Lee website, and hackathon mockups on a separate portfolio site along with all your Logo efforts.. Should be ready to apply by Feb 18th if you stick to it!. Then applications for the following 2 days, and then practice UX design interview questions  and behavioral questions and keep designing until your interview!. :P Sorry, I like making plans. Should probably do at least 1 website design, which could be the css/html for your blogger webcomic
I'm not sure.
I think different domain endings would be better.. Recruiters aren't going to spend a lot of time on your website, so you want to make sure they are looking at the right projects right away. But you could do some research on UX portfolios/websites and see what they are doing
Oh wait.. what am I thinking... You are not UX.. you should be Visual Designer.. Have you been applying to those positions?
It's a huge plus if you have UX and CSS/HTML though, so learning those skills could increase your chances!. You can, but I have been looking at the listings and they seem to be leaning more toward CS capable. You can be anything you work toward though!!. https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&clickSource=searchBtn&typedKeyword=visual+designer&sc.keyword=visual+designer&locT=S&locId=2280&jobType=
These job descriptions match your qualifications more readily. Oh dude!!. Check out ZapLabs listing. My friend, Michael works there and could refer you!
No, but he knows me, and I know you.. That's how connections work. You fit the qualifications, no?. Task for you: Make something in Sketch. Whatever Sketch is. I have heard it mentioned a lot
Oh good!. Yup, the free trial should be enough
Also add this to your todo list: (and if you don't have a todo list, get one ;P) Soup up your Linked In profile with Courses you took, some major projects (like Frosty Parrot), and also descriptions under your education listings
Cool!. :(
I wish I had a good place to host you.
Do you know what responsive design is?. https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/. You can get those visual designer jobs after 1.5 weeks of hard work and prep in learning UX and CSS/html :D. I believe in you!
Good job!
Looks good!
Right, I've seen that happen!. Just for YouTube, I was thinking about making it complete a simple homework assignment (like multiplication tables?).
Thanks for the idea! I wasn't planning on that though. Just robot doing homework :P. Maybe I can get a kid to act in it. Know any 8 year olds?. Or kids?
Ooh. Maybe Gap will let me use him :P. I would give him commission if the video did well, of course.. Haha :P. He would just be like... "NAO, will you do my homework?" And then the robot will be like,. *does homework*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hqNi2S4rlM
technology and girls?
How old is Jet?
Is he still adorable?
Oh right! I can't remember :O. Well I'll plan it out! He wouldn't actually get to see the robot though unless he visited Charlottesville though :(. Since I can't exactly borrow the $8000 robot.
Haha, are they going there anytime this semester?
I would just film it separatelu. Or.... I can find a kid in Cville>. ?*. Maybe one of my housemates has a cute brother
Or sister
Cute kid + Robot doing homework = Youtube success?. + Social media. :P
I've always dreamt of the robot doing homework!
Oh, link?!. Haha :P. If I got you Pikachu boxer briefs, would you wear them?
I'm not, It's a hypothetical question.
But would they make you happy?
Pikachu pocket shirt?
Ahh, so cute. I just saw an ad for them
Yay!. Aw man, can only find it in women's size. http://www.ebay.com/itm/TEEFURY-WOMENS-BLUE-PRE-SHRUNK-SHORT-SLEEVE-PIKACHU-IN-POCKET-T-SHIRT-TOP-SIZE-S-/112288457769?hash=item1a24e9e429:g:-JsAAOSw5cNYkXO7
Haha
Pikachu cuter!. don't you think?
But do you like that one more?
https://www.google.com/search?q=pocket+pusheen+shirt&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS653CL653&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=638&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1tvzM9vfRAhWl3YMKHSrqDPgQ_AUIBygC. Actually still not as cute as pikachu to me
Can't beat that cutie pikachu!
:(
:(
I'm not sure
:3
No, the hug ^-^. But I'm going to get to sleep shortly
^-^ !!. So nice
Stay for cuddles
Yay!
Hmm, what do you think of Sansita?. https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/sansita
I'm trying to decide :P. I might just go with the stock Roboto. Tail thing?
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Droid+Sans. Oh I see!
I'll go Roboto!
Robo!
Neat!
Yup!
Hehe, might be a while still
Rawr!
Nope!
Thank you for that!
Goodnight!
I trust your judgement!. http://www.inventadventure.com/. html :O
I want to use a logo in the top instead of just plain font.
And I'll make a favicon!
Thanks for the offer!
I bet you could get it done pretty quickly!. So if you could, that would be awesome.. And maybe help a bit in design too!
Thank you!
Yup!
See you then!
Okay, thanks!
Why sad face ? (:. :(*
Why sad?
Okay, that's good!
Why are you sad?
Sorry to make you feel that way
Could you ask me these things instead of making assumptions? It bothers me that you don't try to understand me before jumping to conclusions.
And your earlier comment made me feel like it is a bad thing that I spend time with other friends. Do you think I shouldn't be meeting up with friends?
Do you think spending time together yesterday was not enough time?
Also, what was your answer to my previous question?. It wasn't rhetorical
It's a dangerous viewpoint to believe it is better to forgo communication.
"I know it won't change anything." Grr, apathy at it's worst.. Why do you have such a one-sided viewpoint?
Want to what?
Why do you think that?
It's my preference that we have a discussion. I tried to reiterate last time that I think you making assumptions is unproductive, so I'm not going to respond to them positively, if at all.
If you have a problem, please talk to me about it. But don't do so in a way that doesn't leave any room for discussion.
What is there to say? My thought was to try and point you toward some constructive questions.
Why?
That's not what I mean.. I mean that instead of just stating things, you should try and ask questions, as well as lead the discussion toward some sort of resolution
I would love to spend more time with you, but not this weekend, because my house is not presentable, and I would rather stay home and work on homework. Also, I think it is alright to just have one main activity that we do together (like the laser tag), instead of having you over the whole evening.. I was really surprised that you felt neglected after just having done something yesterday.. How much time would be enough for you to not feel neglected?
I'm sorry, I felt like it was not good timing; I would have preferred some flow into it.
Well we don't see enough other often and I think I need a warming up period for that.. For some reason I don't feel super close to you, which could be due to the lack of deep conversations we have or something else.
It's been this way for a while though.. It wasn't just last time.. And we're always having this same conversation it seems. Doesn't it sound familiar?
Really, Edward is not the problem. It's been so long.
It could be a problem if it is still something that bothers you.. I'll be there soon!. Was it 4:10pm?
4:20 is good!. Could you have the foods ready?
I told you yesterday. 8 whole containers of smoothies, and 3 dinner bags (doesn't matter which ones)
Eep, would it be hard to come meet me?
My house
Ty!!. Fast enough?. If not I am passing by at 4:45
Thank you so so so much!. Ps I love you!. I have lots of homework tonight,  but I'll try to answer your questions tomorrow
I haven't designed anything yet :I. :O *
Thank you so so so so much for bringing the food over on such short notice!!
Thank you. !1. The beanie looks good for headspins :D
It does!. Does it actually fit yours?
Well it looks like a keeper!
Thank you!. Mostly homework :P. I probably should have finished that before working on my blog
I am imagining my favicon with IA on it, but in some crafty way that shows what the blog is about.. Or it could have an icon on it. The main logo should say Invent Adventure, and might also be craftily made :O And could have an iconic image next to it or behind it or in it.
And then for the cover photo, I was imagining a illustrated collage of lots of activities I have tried in the past, tech, and travel themed things.. Not Popsicle sticks, but I think you get the idea.. Or optionally, a photo as the cover photo. The logo would also be used for the facebook and twitter profile pictures
Thanks!
That could be nice!
I like the idea of using a hot air balloon to symbolize adventure, but I don't want to copy any really really popular logos out there
Nah, the whale is so random.
Also, I'm not a big fan of pastel colors, but maybe I'd have to see it to like it
Hmm. I wasn't envisioning that, but it could work
I plan to do design further down the week since I'm strapped with homework. So just work on your own stuff for now.. How is the UX learning?. Or what were you up to today?
Oh I didn't know you finished!. Neat!
Okay!. Are you going to VT Hacks?
You're in. Most likely. It's a pretty non competitive hackathon!
Neat!
I got an A in my Ecology class!
Aw, what happened?
The sun?
Well I'm sorry that happened to you.
I am sorry that you were disappointed like that.
Yup, I know what you mean.
It's going well!. How is what you're doing going?
No
I am preparing a presentation for tomorrow's class!. And next I am writing a Literature Synthesis for my thesis.
Cooperative Autonomous Systems
It's about behavioral based systems, and how we can use that framework to deal with more complex tasks.. I'm presenting a research paper.. http://robotics.usc.edu/publications/media/uploads/pubs/60.pdf
Thanks. Goodnight, Peter
Good morning!
Have a great day!
RAWR
Are you busy?
In about 15 minutes, would you mind reviewing my presentation slides?
Awesome! I am still working, but I will let you know when I finish!!. tinyurl.com/bbsarch. Eep
Noo :P. Not scary. *phew* 30 minutes to go until talk time
Thanks!. Are the main concepts becoming clear to you?
Oh yeah, those are my secret notes
Can I call you and practice explaining to you?
Yay! I did it!
Next hurdle is writing my lit review. Good thing it will get finished though (:
3 hours til the finish line :D. More like a Leandra paced 5k. :P
Thank you!!! :D
*bumps into tree while waving*
:D!! I can do this :O. *after gaining conciousness*
*in race*
*me writing my lit synthesis*
:O
I'll miss you!. Yay! Thank you :D
:O. Starting is hard. I feel like I just need to chat it out.. Oh yeah, did you know you can message yourself?. https://www.messenger.com/t/peter.mattox. I think I will do that!
Yay Doc!. (hugs for cat)
Me too!
All the kinds. O.o
42?. eep, I got this!. I need to send you my first paragraph by 3:45pm or else. And my second paragraph by 4:15pm
<words>. I have learned that my procrastination knows no bounds when it comes to writing papers.. :P. 1.5 hours to deadline and still moseying along...
In his book, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, Habermas inspired the idea of a connection between public discussions and politics through the coining of the "public sphere," a virtual space of mass communication between the government and the public (Habermas, 1991).  With the creation of the internet, scholars pondered about how this new channel of communication would influence politics, and referenced Habermas to define the internet as a modern public sphere (Papacharissi, 2002; Castells, 2008).  More recently, with the popularity of social media on the rise, researchers speculate that social media, like the internet, has an effect on politics.. Eep, I'm going. This is like a half paragraph so far. Haha, 3 sentences. Just need 3 more of those
3x3 =9 sentences :D. Does it make sense so far?
More on the way!!. 4:07 3 more sentences 4:12 3 more sentences 4:18 done
That much time?. That much work :P
Well there is a ton of work behind the scenes. Oh no, almost 4:07!
Eep.. New time line... 4:12  4:20 4:30. I'll still be okay!. (it's due at 5pm)
Thanks
Researchers have also devoted efforts toward investigating social media in regards to political situations in both the Middle East and Nigeria. In the Middle East, scholars express that social media was a tactical tool in mobilizing the Arab Spring Revolutions (Tudoroiu, 2014; Tufekci & Wilson, 2012).  In Nigeria, the discussion hovers around the use of social media as a platform for political commentary and to express discontent in leadership (Asinobi-Iroadu, 2011; Williams-Elegbe, 2015), though one study argues that this may lead to violence and tension rather than positive change (Okoro & Nwafor; 2013). In my research, I plan to investigate not only whether social media facilitates the public sphere, but whether it is able to act as a democratizing agent in the specific cases of Facebook in the Middle East and Revoda combined with Twitter in Nigeria.
Submitting now!. Thanks for hanging with me!
:O. I'm not sure!. It sounds nice, but maybe you should test on fabric before putting it on the shirt. Also, I bet it looks great as is (:
Cute!. I meant test whether you cna do it first :P
Oh wellt loo! ks goo!dI
I've made it!!. Celebratory call?
*high five*!. :O
That's more like it ^-^
Haha
World Record?
Oh yeah! One of my friends had that!
Yeah!!. I can't remember who it was :O
What a wonderful shirt series
https://www.riptapparel.com/
https://www.riptapparel.com/collections/nesmo. I like the graveyard!
Thank you!. Sweet dreams!. I love you!!. (hug)
*cuddles*
^~^
I'm not sure if I want any snowflakes.. But your best judgement is fine!. Smores for breakfast!. Ahh, Amazon keeps going up and I am having regrets that I didn't buy when it was lower :P. Hoping it goes back down.... Change of $8 today already :O
It will go back up if it goes down!. Forecasted to break $1000 by the end of the year.. But who knows. The snowflakes looks nice, but how can you ensure one of them won't end up in a funny spot?
Okay!
Thank you!
That's a good strategy, but you need at 25k min to do day trading like that. need a 25k min**. That's called short selling
Google is up $9 today :O
I should have at the start of day :P Not sure where it's going now that it's gone up so much. Could go back down
Yeah? I didn't know that
Oh my goodness, stock doubled then :O
I'm not interested in Nintendo. Unless they have another Pokemon Go :P Or otherwise
It's not on the recommended long term investment list
It's not on my broker
Does that translate well to other companies?
You should invest in the stock market too :P
More like "what to invest ?". :P. I'd invest in Amazon. For sure. And also Alphabet (Google). And Netflix. Micron is supposed to be a good pick, but I'm just going to hold it long term. short term*
Yup yup!
Technically all you need is $5 to get started since some low stocks are $1. But you won't see much return unless you do a tonnn of research or just get lucky
I'd recommend you get a job first unless you have what it takes to be a real entrepreneur and carry out your YouTube/webcomic business!. Or maybe get a job and do the webcomic thing on the side :P. Since it doesn't seem like a huge time commitment either way.. Speaking of which, how is the comic?
Don't forget to post to multiple platforms and get the marketing out. Once you have about 3 posts
Make sure to include your domain on the comic that way it doesn't lose creds
I bet you are an Imgur user :P
Yup! Which channels do you frequent?
:O
Imgur channels? Like Reddit channels?
Yup!
Neat!
Neat!. I hope your day is going well too
What are you doing today?
Neat. Any plans on the job front?
What do you mean?
There aren't any expectations.. It's just whatever you set for yourself.
Well there are expectations, I guess those are inevitable, but I am not expecting a lot.. Or at least, it doesn't seem like a lot based on what I think your capabilities are.
Oh don't worry, that's definitely not one of my expectations at all. Art just takes forever. I would always stay late at art in middle school :O
That's totally fine.
What do you think I expect of you?
Finished with what?
Well that's the wrong idea. If you think it's just my expectations you're carrying out, then you'll never be motivated to actually do it yourself?
But what is the extent of your slowness?
I mean, how long can you delay getting a job?
Okay. https://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/sk/copingWithRejection.htm <- helpful resource?
I guess I thought you had more opportunities available to you like getting in on Substitute teaching, or at least working a part-time job. Or amping up your resume by learning skills. Or doing freelance work online for not much money.. I am sorry I am always picking on you for this, but I really feel like there is more you could be doing to help yourself. Do you feel like you've been really on top of things?. Also, changing the skills you have certainly changes whether you get hired or not. If you have no skills, you have a very very low chance of getting a job. The more skills you have (and proveable skills), the more likely you are to get a job.. And since you haven't had an interview yet, then the skills on your resume and your portfolio somehow just don't match up to the jobs you are applying to (and I realize you've tried working on this, so good job).. I feel like you could be taking advantage of networking more by reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn, and also asking your past teachers for advice on getting hired by asking them to review your resume.. Just part of me thinks you don't have enough motivation because you don't have to struggle with not having enough money to pay rent or for food.. Not sure though.. Do you feel highly motivated?
If I weren't even in the picture, then what would your response be?
What do you have to change what you're motivated on?
What do you mean?
Well that's life I think! College helps you practice juggling different things to get you ready for life.
Just time management. Spend an hour on each thing everyday instead of trying to block it together. Or if blocking things is working, then stick with that?. What did you do during college when you had a ton of things due at once?
That's a tough model to apply to most scenarios.. Like during a job you might have multiple clients at the same time.
That doesn't work so well for all things, right? Like soccer juggling.. Eep, have I said too much? Is this even helping?
Ah, I know. Change comes from within, I can't do anything for you.. I'm sorry.
Don't forget: "I am not a product of my circumstances, I am a product of my decisions"
I guess it depends on what you need help with.. What do you need help with?. Ah, looks like I have small group so I'll talk to you later!. Still let me know if you do need help with anything. Maybe your only problem is with me. Would you be a happier camper without me?
Glad to see your comic there!
I know! It's for you, not for me.
Oh no, try to avoid statements like that. It implies that my actions determine your happiness in someway. some way *
Well I don't like it, so I am sorry I can't make you happy.
Nothing's wrong with it! I just don't think it's funny. It needs more cute things.. I think it only will appeal to a small demographic and also crosses some line by writing a comic about writing comics. But those are all okay things!
There's lots of information about marketing online!. P.S. What does your father think about Trump now?
I think he should not be president.. :(. He is very insensitive. and not eloquent, nor just. Just not a good role model or person.
What do you think?
You're fine! I just don't feel like I know enough information about the current political state to respond.
Well I know the basics, but I don't know the complexities of Trump's plans for the branches of government
Oh it went well!
We went over the bible verse 2:3:1-18 Peter
It was just a reminder to be patient for the Lord's coming and to continue to repent.
It was!
I hope you had a good day too!. What are you doing tomorrow?
Sleep tight!. I'll let you know when I wake up!
Today I am going to classes 9-2pm, then linear algebra homework 2-3pm, then reading research papers 3-4:30pm, learning chinese before my 5pm class, then hanging out with Sam, then violin practice, then breakdancing practice!. What about you?
Ni ye shi
I mean, you too!
Neat!
I hope it goes well!
?
What's the purpose of saying that?
Well why would you use the word "date"?
Why is it a date?
Okay, that's fine then.. I just thought you specifically chose that word to taunt me :(
Because by saying that I makes me feel like you are indirectly pointing out that I shouldn't be hanging out with other guys
Could you not use that word in the future to describe me hanging out with friends?. A date to me implies a romantic meeting.
If you were hanging out with Gap, I'd probably just say "enjoy your time with Gap". Or "have a good time with Gap!". or "have fun with Gap". It's a regular occurrence, not so out of the ordinary.
Thanks
Thanks!
Oh definitely!
Thanks!  I hope you are having fun learning how to use that Adobe program!
Bye!. Goodnight!. How did your activities go?
What went wrong?
Oh no, allergies!. Are you okay other than allergies ?. Sweet dreams to you!
Good morning!!. And Amazon never went back down :O
How is your day today?
It is going well!!
Thanks :D. You too ^-^
Good night (:
Whoops, sorry I missed your call
I am not
Thank you! I'm just about to get to sleep now! How about you?
Sleep tight $. !**. Ahh, the exclamation sign is always so close to the dollar sign. Are we still planning something for Valentine's Day?
What sort of events were you looking for?
Are you going to drive over for just the day?
I'm free 5-7pm for something! I guess dinner would be good!
No. I'd rather you not come though
I thought you might have had something planned. But since you don't,  you should come just to have dinner with me for less than 2 hours.. Shouldn't *
It's getting late, we better get to sleep!! Goodnight!
Talk about what? You seem pretty set on your own outlook
I guess inaction is action. Don't over think things, okay?
Goodnight!
Good morning!
Thanks!. What are you up to today?
No
Just the usual
Just regular chatting
Yes
No
I'm not sure what the question means. What do you mean?
I would like you as a boyfriend. I liked how things were going and I'm not totally sure what is wrong. What is wrong?
Okay
I think that I do like talking to you and I do want to spend time with you.
I am picking up my cap and gown, programming turtle bot and going to Pearl Hacks!
It is at Chapel Hill! It doesn't start until tomorrow, so I'll try and write one page tonight.. Turtle bot is like a room a plus a kinect!. Roomba
It moves around and has sensors!
I think I would like to make it be a goalie
By sensing human form and predicting how the person will kick the ball
It will be a soft foam ball
Nah, it'll be okay
That's in the realm of my other class called Cooperative Autonomous Systems
No, it is already assembled
Thanks!. What are you doing today?
Haha, I thought you were making the smiley :P. XD. What is the difference between UX and XD?
Ah, okau. Okay*
Try to minimize time to job applications
Try to do the actions that will get you hired in the field fastest
Your goal is to get a job right?
Then use your time wisely by doing what will get you a job in the least amount of time.. I mean maximize your time
Then okay
I think you should look at successful people in the field you want to get hired in and see what their portfolio consists of. I think you are much better off making things that go in your portfolio then just making your portfolio. Focus on efficiency and delivering product, since in the industry, you need to get things to production quickly
I recommended using Adobe portfolio. Also, the assets in your website make it slow loading. Well that could just be my controller. my computer*
Then don't use it. But find something that is easy to update. Because you will want to change it often
Tesla stock is my new target :O
I have made it already!. Not sure if the union will complicate things
Maybe, maybe not. A lot of people are pulling out because they think it is about to drop
You sure about that?
Oh is it?. I also got Micron. Which appears to be a steady decline, but it's projected to double
I kind of missed the Model 3 boom for Tesla last week
As long as the workers don't go on strike or anything :O
That's called selling short!. But I just bought today and I'm over by day trading limit. So I'll have to wait until Monday
Also Twitter died the other da. day*. Stock market is fun1. !*
No. :P. It is listed as Sell by analysts. But who knows. If Donald Trump decides to fund them...
Haha, I'm not that risky. I am only buying when the experts recommend it. But I guess that's how you make the really really big gains; when no one else suspects it. You'd probably make more net losses that way though. I wish I had started this when I started college. I should advise others on this
My mom should not buy stocks because she has debt. When you have debt, there is interest on that debt that is 20% plus. unless you really pick the right stocks to make 20%+ a year, it would be an overall loss. Is that a robot hackathon?
Nice!
Yup!
Yup yup!
Nope, just standard black with a tassle
Turtle bot went well!!
Yup!. I've got it nearly working, just super glitchy :P
I left it to the rest of my team to sort out
The bus is leaving soon, but the hacking doesn't start until tomorrow
Thanks!. I hope there are outlets on the bus
Thanks!
:D
Yeah! It would be fun to play ball with!
Eating pizza then sleep :P. Thanks!
Thank you!
Not sleeping yet, but thanks!
What did you do today?
What did you do with Katy?. Ooh, and what did you do in XD?
Neat! What did you eat today?
Cool. Taco bell has burrito bowls!
What did you get?
I have not eaten it yet! Thanks for asking though
Thank you!
Nope. They are playing Finding Dory, but we haven't arrived yet
They are playing it at UNc, I mean
It is. (With the little screens, I mean)
Nope, I'm going to sleep ^-^
Thank you!!. Sweet dreams (:
Hi!. Could you help me brainstorm a good domain name?
It's to generate your own FB messenger chatbot that sounds like you (generated by training a model on your entire messenger history)
Something that will win the best domain name award :P. preferably a .com
Right right
Thank you!
I'm good now! Thank you!!
Probably chatwithyourself.com or something
Eep
No, you're good!. I've got it (:
I appreciate the help!
It did. Fb scraping is underway!!
Scraping refers to gathering data
Oh I gotcha!!
Yay. Om nom dinner soon!!
It will be tough to automate for other people to have their own chatbot, so I will start just making one that sounds like me and then automate it if I have time. Not sure! Lunch was sooooooooooo good though!. Mediterranean with grape leaves!
It was tacos!. :P I'm not going to sleep. Are you?
Thank you!
Ponyo wants ham!!. Om nom nom!
Mmm ham!
Thank you!. You too!
There just hasn't been anything to respond to. You say: "That's beginning to be all you ever say" , and it really doesn't leave any room for discussion. I would just say "Okay" or give instances where I have said other things, which wouldn't lead to any constructive results. I could potentially have asked why you think so.
Okay
What do you mean?
Alright. You have a knack for finding cute gifs!. You should never settle for less though!. If there's a problem, you should fix it, not just live with it.
What's that mean?
Oh good
It's true
They are!
That's spooky
What were you up to today?
Sounds like a productive day!. I'm going to nap now so I'll talk to you later!
Thank you! I just arrived home
You too!
I love you too!. Cute!
All
Good morning!! Have a fantastic Monday!!
Whoa, my portfolio is up $300 today!!
Yeah! Question is.. should I sell? :P. I'll check forecasts/news later today!
Haha, you seem to like selling short a lot. The problem is that you could sell and then it will keep going up. It doesn't always go back down! (Like when I should have bought Amazon)
That is interesting!. I may consider upping my Tesla holdings since they are doing well, but maybe maintaining diversity is safer. Also,  I've never heard of the big short
Oh right!!. Yup, I did! It's supposed to be a big player this year. But right now it's dropping
If it went back up soon enough I would, but I don't think I have the funds to risk unless I pull some out of Amazon. Maybe.... Tesla is huge right now :O
Yeah, I wish I did sooner. It's been up 20% in the past 2 weeks. That means if I invest everything in Tesla I would've made 3000 :O. Invested*. It was the announcement of a new product that did it!
ModelS?. Wait, I mean up 20% the past week. This whole month has been +40%. Crazy growth!
Yeah!!
Micron?. It's had huge gains already, too. +140% the past year
Up for now, but might die later
Stocks are fun!
Save early ^-^. I've done investment simulations and the future looks good. As long as nothing crazy happens :O Next financial crisis
I also have been selling those empty Nintendo ds cases! Made $100 in just 5 days so far. One of my mom's debts is due soon so I am really pooling everything
Yeah, those Anime type ones that we fetched from the dumpster :P
Preparing your Tuesday comic?. I'm surprised they are worth like $15 a case
Sorry for discussing finances often lately
It's a pleasant surprise
I don't assign a lot of value to collector's items, which is why I find it surprising
In class and OH until just now. Working on applications and HW. What about you?. Another class at 5pm :O
That's neat! What did you do earlier today?
Ah okay!. What do you have so far?
If you are designing for your portfolio, you should design a popular style of app that companies are likely to make since they will have similar UX elements. Such as store apps (like the mobile apps for Walmart or Best Buy). Or messaging apps like What's App or other social apps
That's normally a good place to target!. Have you read some articles on how to make a hit app?
Those veterans usually have good tips!
These are pretty good tips: https://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/02/02/check-app-addictive-enough-make-money/. Also, here is the original slideset the article is based on if you are interested http://www.slideshare.net/IsraelMobileSummit/innovation-apps-and-the-monetization-hexagon-eric-reiss-fatdux. Ps. Would you be willing to give revamping the Sol Tower logo another shot. ?*
Oh good!
Here are the instructions:. Eep, copy paste has failed me. The font in that one is intended to look like this:. And some variation of the banner-in-window design. Peter can use a bit of artistic freedom with this one: I'm in no way attached to colors, or the particular charge on the banner (could easily be a sun, or a sun-and-tower, etc.). "I personally like the first design I sent you, so as a matter of personal preference Is like to see one that pretty similar to that". That's it
Anytime
Yup!
Hi! How are you doing?
I am doing well!
Sweet dreams!. I hope you had a great day too!
^-^
Thank you :3
Good morning! Happy Valentine's day!
Cute gif!
Thank you! I hope you are too!
Not right now.. What about you?
I'll let you know later! I have small group right now.
Hi!. How's it going?
It's going well!
Eep, no, not at the moment.. What about you?
What did you want me to say?
Oh, you mean thoughts?
Sure. I think it's become difficult to talk to one another. I haven't been completely supportive of you and I feel like it will be difficult  for me to change that since I place a lot of value in ambition, self care, and goal-achieving. I find it difficult to relate to you because I feel like we have had very different experiences through college.. What are your thoughts?. I'm getting to sleep now, but I'll get back to whatever you write out in the morning!. Goodnight (:
But thoughts?
Ah, wrong button sorry.. But why are you not happy with our relationship?
Okay.. Goodnight for now!
No, it's just a reception of your messages
No, I responded by acknowledging that my lack of support has been hurtful
I can. That's the only thing anyone can change, really.. Changing things about yourself is how you influence the world
What do you mean by that? What forms does support take?
How am I not supportive?. In what ways do I show you I am unsupportive?
How so?. Because I do like your work
I support your comic. I am all for you making comics.. I think you should do more marketing. I don't have to like the content of your comic to be supportive of you making them
I support them!. How am I unsupportive?
Is that the extent of my unsupportiveness?
Why is that so hurtful?. Or is there something else that is hurtful?
It's just a button on a page. I tried seaching for your page today, but couldn't find it.
I had a tough time finding it :O. Anyway, goodnight to you
I don't have to do anything
Thank you!
I love you too!. I feel very boxed in by you saying that you expect me to do certain things (makes me want to do what you expect). You should hold high expectations for me in all aspects, especially relationship related
I would say it depends. I dislike that it comes down to your lifestyle choices, but after some reasoning, I think it is fair to feel this way because these sorts of things would really start to have a toll in a more serious relationship.  If I were seeing you everyday, or even living with you these things would probably bother me even more than they do now. So with that, I would say if you were able to get a job, start working, meet up with friends regularly, move out, and be working toward some goals, then I could imagine the relationship working out. Until then, I don't see a whole lot going for us.  I understand that you've been making an effort, and that is really important, but it's been months since I first brought up my concerns, and months that you've been searching, and it doesn't seem to me like you are doing everything in your power to try and get a career, or just some way of supporting yourself. I know if you really wanted a job, you could have something (anything!) within a month, much less half a year. It just seems unreasonable at this point for you to still be relying on your parents and not even using what resources you do have to get on your feet and start being independent (like selling all those video games in your room or freelancing by marketing yourself on the internet). I'm glad you are keeping up with your webcomic, and I hope that takes off, but if you want any of your hobbies to be a form of income, you need to do some research. You mentioned your dream is doing animation, but you haven't made any noticeable signs of continuous progress in learning animation. It's so hard to imagine a life with you at the moment because I really need someone who is supporting themselves and working toward some goal. It's hard to imagine this August where I will be working and you might still at home with no career outlook, no plan; I can see myself eventually growing resentful and the accompanying problems. I don't think you are lazy because I know once you are on something you can work really hard, but it seems like there is something holding you back. I've been hoping and waiting for something to change. Does any of this sound inaccurate or unreasonable?
And where do you see this relationship going?. Or where did you see it going (before I mentioned the above)?
Okay. Feel free to still chat with me about whatever random stuff you want.
Neat!
I like it
No worries! Thanks again for working on this!!
"THAT'S AWESOME.". Like, I've been trying to do that for while now.  I do have a few ideas: make the bricks and banner a bit rougher (a few chinks missing here and here), possibly shorten the banner a little and instead add simple little wisps of cloth flying off the end like wisps off of fire.  I'm not gunning for a fiery color scheme but I would like to see this in a white/bright yellow to red gradient, on the banner and possibly on the little sun logo, but the latter might be too busy.. In the case of that color scheme, maybe make the letters silver
Looks too complex to me
Neato!
In response to your first yellow blue one:. I, too, love this. @leandra_irvine , if color scheme changes are easy, I'd also like to see green and gold! I personally think the sun logo should stay clean, but like the idea of rougher bricks in the window and a sort of frayed look at the end of the banner. But this looks amazing. So I guess do one with swapping out the red for green or something?. Again, thanks!!
Thanks!
Thanks! I'll let you know tomorrow
Goodnight!
:O. Zao!
It's short for Good morning in Mandarin
Zaoshang hao!
Yup, but I think you just say Zo. Zao*
You too!. In response to your logos:. "My jaw literally dropped". "GOOD LORD". @leandra_irvine , Let me get Matt S's opinion, but I'm personally ecstatic about the red version, and would be happy to move forward with it. Any chance we could get the corresponding .svg and a high-res .png with transparent background?
Are there any common logo sizes?
https://globalspex.com/logo-dimensions/. Probably make a folder and label each logo with the specific usage
You can make that too if you want and label it for shirts. Not sure though
Highest quality svg and png, and we can always scale down.. As the main 2 files. And then we will need it for the app splash screen
Okay
https://developer.android.com/studio/write/draw9patch.html. You could hold off on that for now
Yup!
Thanks!. "That is straight up one of the most well-designed logos I've ever seen!"
Why biased?
That wasn't from the designer
Neat animation. It doesn't look quite right though. I think that's because the little fabric pieces are stationary. They should be flying off most likely
You're good.. There would probably need to be frames of the banner moving/different shading too
Well it looks like you have the ripple effect going, but the twisting point of the banner should change as the ripple goes through it. Also maybe a sun coming up?. Or not
We'll need something simple for the splash screen and other games at some point. But static will work in the meantime!
Thanks!. Good night!
Want to go to Vienna with me?
I would be going March 4 to March 10th most likely. If funding goes through, I will be attending a conference on the 7th, and 8th, which leaves the 4, 5, 6, and 9 for sight seeing! And you can do some solo sightseeing on the 7th and 8th!. (If I get the grant), your hotel would be on me, you'd just have to pay for your flight (does your credit card have a promotional 0% APR?)
Great! If your credit line is more than $850, you could always charge it to there (but of course you'd have to pay it back eventually)
Hmm, that would work, but we should probably put it together so we can sit together. I could see if I can put it on my new CC
I am submitting my application now (: Hopefully I get sponsored!
Yay, submitted!. How has your day been?
That sounds productive!. Which classes are you most looking forward to?
Interesting! Did you know all these designers before hand?
It's always good to have role models :O !. My day has been great! I am trying out a new sleep schedule, I learned some more Chinese, we had another thrilling drone test flight today, and I applied for MHacks and the Vienna Conference.
Using the Hello Chinese app?. Be sure to supplement with YouTube videos or other resources; I noticed there are a lot of essential conversational phrases that you don't learn right away.. I really like the app though (:
I am trying out the biphasic sleep schedule, which is less extreme than the Everyman which I previously attempted and failed :P. It consists of a main 4.5 hour sleeping block (1:30am-6am for me), and a 1.5 hour nap (taken around 7pm)
1.5 hours everyday = 22 extra 24-hour days per year of awake time! Also, it is one of the few polyphasic sleep schedules that is commonly used and has research studies showing it is beneficial (supposedly :O). I don't usually even when I monophase, do you think it would help?. (Math:  1.5*365 = 547 extra hours /24 = 22 days!)
Oh, I got twilight for my phone! It dims the screen extra and has a red-tint if desired.. Thanks! Sleep hygiene is extra important for adapting to new schedules.. Today's nap was really great! I woke up naturally after the 1.5 hours. Most likely because it follows the 1.5 hour rule, which is nice :D!. Do you actually only sleep 7 hours?. (when you mentioned the 6 hours sleep results in an extra hour)
I slept 7.5 alwayas.. always*. 1.5 hour blocks is the way to go!. (P.S. it is 'affects', not effects), sorry to correct you! Just want to inform you in case it wasn't just a typo
Okay good!. Same with the you're / your thing :P. For some reason it bothers me, especially when used in the context of compliments!
Not today, but it is generally a consistent typo you make. Do I have any of those?. (besides that ! always turning into a $) :P
Yup!
No problem. Now that I know you know, I will probably be less bothered!
No worries. Oh man, it's bed time! Imma go brush my teeth!
Goodnight!! (:. VT hacks tomorrow! :D
Oh good!. By consistently, I don't mean like every week, but I mean that it seems to span all of time.. I can see how that would be tough to search for too!
There's a good typo. Made by me on Easter 2011. It was never pointed out :P. Hey, I thought you lost your chat history :O
Goodnight (:
Good morning!
Yeah! What sorts of technology did you want to work with?They usually have Leap Motions, Oculus Rifts, Arduinos (or other microcontroller), and  Amazon Echos. I am planning to work on making a chatbot again, since I went in a different direction last time!yeah, my facebook is being pretty weird too.. sorry for the late-ish response..
You have strep?! aww don't die!! lol maybe it'll be a good excuse to eat ice cream? (: sorry for this random message.. just haven't talked to you in forever.. soo... yeah... see you tomorrow hopefully!
You're welcome for caring enough :P  And that's good. Oh yeah.. I'm kinda hoping that we won't have school, but at the same time, I'd kinda like to go..  lol i know i'm "talking" to you on skype right now.. I just felt obligated(weird word... o.o) to reply.. *presses "Reply" button*. wow.. i'm so weird..
lol me.. awesome? pshh those words don't go together :P mantee+awesome=right
hmm.. well... I think it needs a Peter in there instead (:  [Peter is amazingly awesome] So... how's your throat today?
That's good (:  My day has been pretty ordinary + lazy :P  I still have some homework to do somehow.. What about you?  lol maybe we should Skype IM instead :D
psst... can we change the time to 2 o'clock? sorry.. I like just asked my mom and she says 1 is too "inconvienient..". wait.. hmm 1:30 maybe.. lol sorry
hmm.. 2 i think.. sorry for the slow response :P
whoa.. how'd you get home so early? :P sorry.. i like just got home 10 minutes ago..   And it wasn't anything important.. i was just going to ask you something that'd be a little un-relevant now..
'Ello.. I heard you were sick.. So I just wanted to make sure you weren't on the verge of missing school for too long. Yesterday, I didn't get to wave to you in the hall, It was depressing. *teardrops on my guitar* I feel like we don't talk quite as often as we used to... *reminisces*  Those were good times.. Well, I'll try not to ramble for too long, but here's hoping you get better *holds up glass to make toast*.. hmm, why do they call it a toast? :P    Cheerio (:
Howdy :P, Well, caring is sharing. lol yeah.. That'd be kind of odd though. "Oh look, It's 2 am, time to talk to Peter. :P"  But we do need to talk occasionally.. I just.. can't go on without those talks *dramaticness* .. And it's fine, the guitar still plays :p  You too! ~0~
P'
lol sorry for all the pokes
lol :P Well I poke back after you too, so i'm just as much to blame. And yeah! Totally! So, how are you feeling today?
That's really good :D I'm okay..
I dunno.. i've just been feeling a little down lately, it's nothing though.. so, what's up?
Oh whoops.. I'm sorry to say that I kind of fell asleep :P. Ooh I saw that note on Facebook, It's really good (: You could be the next big thing :P
Haha, maybe Disney will find you and you can make a cool music video that plays 24/7 :P  Have fun at track, whenever that is (:
Fun is always good (: And thanks, lol I'm just doing homework, but I guess that can be fun in some weird way that i haven't discovered yet :P
Lol, wishful thinking is always nice :P  See you at school I guess?
Well, you're up early :P Track today?
Hmm. What reason? :P sorry, you got me curious.
:P Lol Whoa, me too kind of.. I woke up unnaturally early, from an extremely weird dream about pineapples... So, how are you feeling on this Friday morning?. oh whoops I didn't refresh :P Hmm.. It's going okayish.. How's it going for you?
Pshh allergies are plenty fun :P jk, of course.. I hope they miraculously clear up for you without heavy medication :D And well, I dunno. I'm just normally kinda depressed these days :/  Anywho... How has track been going?
That's good (: I bet you'll do pretty amazingly at the meets! Don't worry 'bout it..like I said before, it's nothing..
Hmm.. You always seem to know these things. And yeah, kinda..
Aw, thanks.. That's nice to know.. (:  I'm not sure.. there's not much about it to talk about.. I just miss someone :/  Hmm... If it was 11:11, what would you wish for?
Hmm... I think I'd wish for all your homework to get done :P or maybe for a rainbow.. Those are always nice..
Haha, yeah, I guess you're right. But if I wish for it, and your homework gets finished, then my wish will have come true :P Hmm.. I wish for just the rainbow then.. and maybe a unicorn.. :D
Definitely (o:  On a scale of 1-20, how much do you like the new school schedule? Sorry, random :P
That's a pretty cool number.. Hmm, I guess that's like a little over average, but not exactly good :P
So not what I meant :P You're super unique.. in the best possible way :D
I wish the same.. that way, It'll have a double wish effect.. Like throwing that coin-cake in a fountain :P  You're more fantastically-awesometastically unique and amazing in an amazingnessfantabulous way :P Lol the little red spell-check line keeps appearing.. I wonder why..  Aw, I kinda g2g, you'll be in my thoughts though :D
psst..! you're cool!
no sarcasm.. and you've been cool since forever :D
lol :P
i'm so not cool.. but you're like.. ice cool (:

But you can :D

'Ello! (: So I was just wondering if you ever learned how to whistle... and I just kinda miss talking to you... Have a good Saturday/Sunday! ~0~

Aw, where did life go?. :P
Aw.. *gives you a band-aid* :P  hmm.. well then life isn't a very good friend :P You're awesome.. life is lucky to just have the opportunity to spend time with you :P
lol yeah! :P Life'll probably bring you back so he/she can be with you again :P Well i kinda have'ta go for tonight.. "(  aw I really wish I could stay longer.. ~0~
Sleep tight :P an' don't let the bed bugs bite... I hear they have sharp teeth o.O
No problem :P Byebye ol' friend.. Cheerio :D ooh that reminds me.. Thanks for the fruit loops!
Your name sounds awesome in a british accent! :D  lol Peetah! sorry.. random..
ooh Devils Triangles are fun :D they always remind me of mud for some strange reason :P Aw sorry I randomly send messages.. Hmm I was reminiscing randomly and looking at that super-spectacular-amazing drawing you drew so I felt like saying 'Hi!' (:
Yay (: lol sorry.. So how has life been these past.. *counts on fingers*... days? :P
Whoa! Fantastic? that's pretty amazing (: Life's been good for me :D  We looked at dead onions under microscopes today!  ooh! and in art we made little clay sculptures, but mine has a really big head and shoulders so it looks like it was taking steroids O.o
lol maybe :P he might have a hard time walking though, since the steroids didn't reach his legs :P kinda like the wheelchair police guy in Family Guy
lol I might rather you not :P It's a tad embarrassing.. Did you do anything fabulous today? :P
Ooh frisbee sounds fun :D I always see Gap playing :P That'd be cool if you guys both had the same gym period. I'm kinda terrible at frisbee, so I try to avoid it in fear of accidentally injuring someone with my terrible-ness :P  Aw I think that's so cool!!! and I haven't heard 'em yet, but from past experience, I can definitely consider them songs :P
lol I bet you would :P and you're quite welcome, I'm glad to have said something that means a lot :D  Aw well, I probably shouldn't keep you from whatever any longer.. so I'll see you around I guess? aw I kinda still miss talking after school.  Anywho, G'night and have a nice day tomorrow (:
Oh, lol sorry to um flatter myself :P  ooh I like the all CAPS :D  Bye!
Lol it's ironic, but I overlooked the imessage about you overlooking my message :P  Bye again :P
Aw so, how'd you hurt your arm? sorry, odd.. I was just extremely curious.. Also, who was that guy standing beside you? :P
aw (: that's nice of him (: pshh, you're not pitiful, just temporarily disabled.. lol Whoa, those things sound cool :P aw, well I hope you're recovering well (: injuries can be painful..
That's great news :D \n and you're quite welcome.. \nSee you later I guess (:
you have pretty hair!!! :P. I mean um... a beautiful personality!. anywho.. i just wanted to wish you a happy summer! hmm.. hopefully i'm not too.. stalkery sounding :P
'Ello there.. It's been awhile :P  lol well, I saw you at the park on the caboose... So I just felt like saying 'hi'! :D  Ooh.. And I was wondering if you were free on a certain July 11th (7-11 Day!)  Yeah... :P
Yay (: Cool... And yup, a Sunday...  Twe and I were thinking of going to get some free Slurpees and I was wondering if you'd like to come along too, with you living like 5 steps away from that place and all :P  Too bad Slurpee Day isn't in the winter when they tend to be much more enjoyable :P
Okay cool (: It doesn't have to be too long if there's not much time.. just enough time to slurp a Slurpee and whatnot :P When exactly is that time-slot of freeness for you?
Lol :D Okay... Hmm... Twe and I are planning for 3-5 if that works for you, but you don't have to stay that if you don't want :P. Oh, that's p.m. by the way :P just in case..
lol I have a pretty bad case of mosquito bites :P I'm not sure that's quite the same situation though.. Aw :/ that sounds really sad... I hope you get better soon... This is going to sound odd, but I wouldn't mind :P Just getting to see you would be nice, even if you have poison ivyness all over you :P I wouldn't want to make you feel weird or anything though...and we could always do something later this summer, so um... you pick :P sorry to put pressure on you
Yay :D hmm does 3:00 (pm) at 7/11 work for you? i think it could possibly just be me if that's okay.. :P. Wait, 2:30 actually..
Hey there, Happy Birthday! I hope you get the whole birthday experience this year, cake and all, or whatever you've been wanting. Have a great day :D 
Lol thanks :P hmm, i did have muffins, so I guess those could be similar to cake... In a way :P 
Aw, just cold pizza on your birthday? I would've gladly brought you over a muffin- I would've even stuck sixteen candles in it :p did you at least get that "1st real b-day party"? (:
Awe :( if I had known I would  definitely definitely have brought you that muffin :P actually, scratch that. I'd get you a super amazing quadruple layer rainbow cake :D if you enjoy rainbow cakes, that is. 
Hmm that's pretty awesome :d  Just out of curiosity.. What's your favorite food? 
Lol, for some reason i was expecting that. But cool! :P in that case, I feel much better about your bday cuisine :P
Well, there'll always be memories. and aren't those just as edible and delicious? :P 
Good point. I guess food does have a purpose  after all :P 
Don't feel bad, I think it surprised everyone when they discovered why no one was living past 7 days. :0  In other news, are you having fun in 'graphic design?' (:
Awesome!! I've heard it's pretty neat. And it does seem like, perfectly suited for you you too :D well, from what I know of you.
I bet. You have a ton of experience and not to mention mad skillz :P yup, most likely. Haha! That sounds like something I'd be crazy to miss :D wait, the ninja turtle or the Renaissance painter?
Lol yeah, I guess that'd make more sense :P but omg! That's super duper exciting :D it's like the 3 awesomest things in one: ninjas, turtles, and um... Mutant things :P 
Oh yeah, I was just about to say that- I'm just a terrible counter. And besides, you totally trump 'mutant things' :P . On the coolness scale , at least :P
Lol yes. That's exactly what I meant :P  Well, actually, I had them higher on the 'likely to attack you with a chainsaw or other sharp things' scale :P
Lol :P is it at least reassuring to know that I don't think of you as a potential serial killer?  Ooh! You like the format/ fun. ?! :D 
I have to admit that I didn't know of either until a few months ago, but they're both pretty amazing. I should mention again, that you listen to awesome music :P
Yay! Two ninjas :D that'll be a conversation-starter. I'm a little confused as to how a foot ninja differs from a regular one though... Care to explain? I haven't studied up on my ninjas recently :P
:D omg! That makes it even cooler! :P although, now I regret not watching that tv series... 
I guess so, but that's no excuse on my part- I should've gone the extra mile and found some way to watch it :P ah, I'm actually exited for homecoming now! :D
Pssh, I doubt that you won't. But dates or not, who wouldn't want to go with a ninja? :P
Lol, well I know plenty of girls who would :P  And I guess that's more up to you, guys are the ones who normally ask, y'know? 
That's a pretty good reason not to :P but hey, what about that girl in your English class?
Lol whoops.. I was just testing my psychic Ability :P sorry to leave that hanging last night, I accidentally fell asleep.. o.o
That's good to know :P  
Lol, that's reminiscent of those 'frosted flakes' commercials :D "They're not just good.- They're grrrreat!!'
:P hmm. Are you going to the futbol americano game tomorrow? I do hope that you are..
Ooh, okay.. I think it's around 7ish, but I'm never really too sure with these things :P
That sounds pretty frigorific :P I guess I'll see you there then
Hey, how's that costume coming along? :D 
Awesome! What's it made out of?  lol I saw a girl with a shirt that had like, a graphic of mutant  turtle ninja abs on it, and it made me think of you :P
That's pretty cool :D At least now I know for sure that I wasn't imagining it--I only got a glimpse, so I didn't know exactly what it was :P but yeah, it was definitely a cool shirt.
22.. Hey, sorry I couldn't talk today/yesterday... I kind of passed out on my couch :P But yeah, I was wondering if you {were going to be in/ were going to) that talent show on Saturday.  And see you tomorrow :D Hopefully I'll be nearish to you on the bus.
Pst... Are you at home?
cool :D have fun!
yup, i'm pretty sure. If i can convince my mom to take me :P
You too :D
This is weird, but i was wondering if you were free at all today...
Well i'm just downtown right now with some people so i guess like, sometime before it got dark? :P
lol It's cool, I'll see you tonight anyway (:
Hmm how would you feel about watching the shining with 4 other people who you don't really know at Nika's house? :P
awesome :P They're a good band. And aw, okay
Haha Nika says she'll miss you. So do the people you don't know. And me. :P
Aw, so How's it going?
Whoa, not in real life i hope o.o  It's goin okayish (:. Omg, this is kind of a scary movie :O
Pst When is the talent show?
Whoa really? And It's fine.
Nah, I'll definitely hopefully still be going (:
Just wondering... Is your mom picking you up from the talent show?
Ooh, neat. Lol well that's what i was going to ask, but I'll figure something out :P
lol It's totally okay, i think my mom might be able to take me...
No :P
Really? Lol well i do know andy. But i'm not sure how his mom would feel about that :P Is she picking you up from your house?
Ooh say hi to him for me!
Aw i think i do need a ride... :P
Aw thanks (:
Oh Haha It's fine
don't worry  about it :P
Yeah (:
Is it too late to still go? :P
:P I guess it wasn't.
I'm really glad i made it (: and sorry for what?, you were awesome :D
It's totally fine, i loved every second of it :P I do wish that i had known all the right things to say though
Really? You were? Cause i actually kind of a little lot was too. I think you make me nervous...
If it's anywhere near how nervous i get, then i think i have a pretty good idea of it. :P it's hard to believe that just me could make you nervous though.  I know I've said this before, but you really do always seem so calm and stuff.  I was shooting off every unintentionally-lame comment I could think to say.  And thinking is awfully hard around you. :P   Sorry for the kinda late response, I hadn't realized that this didn't send earlier.
Aw, me too.  Butterflies are like that fuzzy feeling I think.    :P Oh yeah, I noticed that that one time.   Hmm, I hope it snows. :D
Ooh I know! I kind of feel like building a snowman..
yeah :D I've never made like a full out top-hat-wearing, carrot-nosed, button-eyed, coal-nosed snowman...
Oh yeah, good point :P maybe they have one at some rent-a-tux place :D  I wonder if it would come to life.  Haha, I like this 2 conversation thing.
:D In that case, um.. "hi" back!  So I was wondering, Do you like unicorns at all? :P
cool :D lol me too! Yesterday, I was wondering why they're called unicorns instead of unihorns :P  And It goes pretty okay, I'm making frosting :D how does it go over there?
lol, Awesome! :P Well, not exactly, but um, airsoft sounds fun :D
*Wait... Now i'm curious :P
Aw :P That's not creepy... Well, it might have been creepy on It's own, but with the introduction, it actually sounds kind of cute :P
Nah :P You could never be a loser...
Whoa, is that tonight? :D Awesome. The time does seem like a problem though :P  I remember there was a meteor shower at 3 am once and I actually set my alarm clock and went outside in the middle of night :P
Pretty good, just writing an essay :P What about you?
ooh yeah, I've never seen an eclipse before..I feel like the moon would just disappear for awhile and it'd be pitch black :P  And that's always fun :P I always try to start homework early, but I always end up putting it off until the very last second...
Awesome :D Solar eclipses sound pretty too. I'm up for the next one in 2017 :P
lol yeah, it'll go by like nothing :P  Awesome! That's soon, I hope? I should start preparing.. :D
haha :P That'll be fun.  I think the only cheesy pickup lines I know are the ones that you've told me :P.. and those ones that everyone knows.. like... "Are you from Jamaica?" :D
Whoa! really? :P Maybe I can get away with using the classics on you..
There's no one better than you though (:   lol sorry, I thought I would say it again, for good measure. But um.. G'night and sweet dreams and stuff :D
Sorry, i think i should just say G'night...
I have that book :D I always liked to find the little mouse on each page :P! sorry, you're probably talking about the song version though :P I saw a facebook post with that song..
Aw, that song sounds cute :D I like songs like that.
okay, bye! omg you said the word "kiss" :P lol sorry, just kidding. I'm gonna listen to that one day, when I have a pair of headphones handy.  yeah, Bye for real :D I felt I should respond on this because I already said I would stop talking..   See you tomorrow! You're uber amazing!
Kissing is gross :P Bye you even awesomer person, i hope i can talk to you tomorrow... As in i hope i can say smarter or funnier things :P we'll see... Bye!. :D Merry Christmas! I hope it's super-duper-duper amazing and everything! I don't think Santa got to my house yet though :P But yeah, um.. Talk to you soon hopefully!
psst.. what's a Festivus? :P  Ooh thanks! You too! I had some awesome eggnog last night :D!!!
haha, that would explain why I've never heard of it :P  Yeah :P It had some nutmeg on it and everything. That's pretty cool (: Do they live close by?
That's cool :D but yeah, it got pretty intense out there.  My Christmas was extremely average...but alright i guess. (: How was yours?
It's cool :P Lol sometimes i wish there was a little unsend button
It is pretty cold, but way to think on the bright side :P  and yeah, the snow is still nice and powdery too.
haha yeah :D! The moon makes the ground look all glowy!
We're happy tonight :D!
:P So didja get to go sledding tonight?
Aw, i'm not :( my mom didn't want me to, even though It's inside. You?
:P please don't die on a treadmill/elliptical.
dun dun dun.. Aw, I just went sledding with my sis and her boyfriend.. it woulda been so fun with you :D!!
no way, you would've made it awesome :P Are you doing anything todays?
hmm.. interesting :P Do you have a sled-type thing?
Neat-o. just wondering. :P
Nifty! (:
Oh cool :P haha, I have one bright pink one that i've had since I was little.
haha, you have a bright pink one too :P That's so funny!. too?*
That might make a little more sense :P but awesome! haha, "Real men use bright pick sleds". I think I've seen a T-shirt like that.
That can happen.  Haha, not sure if you would want to wear that.
I have your hat. I was going to make a ransom letter for it, but I thought the sender might be too obvious :P So I decided just to tell you. I can drop it off if you need it right away, or just bring it to track practice tomorrow--If you'll be there :P   Ttfn!
I sort of like that second idea :P But yeah, either way.. by the way, Happy Last Day of The Year Day :D
Maybe :P  and oh yeah, that's what today is called :P I'm kind of excited for Taco Bell :D
lol I guess it did :P And it was super duper awesomely fun :D So, still up for tonight?
yay :D lol again, I'm wayy more excited than I should be. Hmm.. how does like.. 6 or 7ish sound? We could like, get a pizza or something? :P
I guess 7 o'clock works a little better for me.  haha, well.. if you like pizza... :P  And it's totally okay if you do :P I wouldn't make you pay anyway.
haha, I like the eye you drew :P And you too! :D
:P Well, I guess it would've looked better on a face
That was a little random :P Pssh, you're not out of your mind.   Aw, I always miss 11:11 :P
Ooh, okay :P That's good, then! lol you wished for.. world peace? or a rainbow-colored pony?
So, you're saying that it wasn't the pony?!
Aw, my wishes never come true unless I wish for boring things like pencils and candy :P  Oh, I missed people in return too!
Been there, done that :P lol jk.. but you are so not boring, so I doubt it would come true :P
I'm not sure if you're physically capable of being boring :P You're just one of those interesting people.
wait, my wish or your wish :P And how would I wish for a person anyway?
haha, That reminds me of toy story or something.  Pssh, I wouldn't want that though :P
Well, then I couldn't really talk to them, it'd be all squeaky and hard to hear :P And I don't think army men can move around very much either.. Maybe just a model of them would work out though :P
Definitely creepy.  haha, now I feel all serious using that word.
:D like... clown school. :P haha I'm terrible at jokes.
lol :P You're just being nice. You're the amazing one :D
Or you're so amazing that you can't even tell how amazing you are :P
Or you already are happy and I'm not amazing :P
Well, neither is the one you just said! :P
Wait, but I'm not super amazing.. and what kind of happy is "happy"? you should be um.. ecstatic :P
Well I think.. um.. um.. Rawr! :P lol I give up on this amazing/ "happy" thing. Wait, I don't give up, I'm just postponing it for later discussion :P
Me either, I don't speak dinosaur/cat :P
Golly gee :P
Aw.. that's too bad :(. Aw.. that's too bad :(
Oh, whoops, it sent twice :P   Ooh, sad rhymes with bad :D
especially if you're a lad or a dad :P
yes indeedy
Whoa, big word :P Most um.. supercalifragilistically :D
yay for um.. Mary Poppins? :D
I've actually never seen that movie. Or at least not that I remember :P
Cool :D I guess it's the same for me ish; like.. I think I remember something about a chimney sweep, but that's about it.
oh yeah me too :P haha I think Saturday Night Live has done some :P psst.. are you doin' anything cool today?
No :P But I sort of just asked my mom if I could do anything today and she was like "No." And I was like... "okay." :P
Oh, well.. I was hoping to do something with you :D lol wait, prior means before, right? :P I get it confused with 'post'
Aw no, it would've been sooo fun :D :P We could've um.. played old shooter games and um.. made smores? :P
lol :P Anything is fun as long as I'm with you. :D lol sorry, one of the most cheesy lines ever
:P lol, so. Snow is pretty fun.
It would :D I'm thinking snow angels :P
Very cool :D or um.. whoa, I've never had like, an actual snowball fight before, like with barriers and stuff :P
Awesome :P That sounds... epic :D!
Whoa, that's really cool :D! Was it like, midair? I've always thought that'd be cool to do with bullets or something
yay :D and after they collide, it'd be like, snowing for a few seconds :D
Aw.. yeah. Then you'd have to do it again :D! :P until it starts snowing.
haha, yeah :P some things are hard with your left arm though. like.. badminton. And possibly throwing snowballs. :D It would be cool to be amphibiousness. ambidextrous*
Me too :P spell check suggested it.
exactly :D but it means well. :P
:D!!! There's so much snow outside (:
Lol definitely :D
You totally could :P like.. run, then play, then run :D or just play tag :P
It would :P lol I do, but it was 2-person ninja tag, so I'm not sure if that really counts.
That's good :D Cause I think the only time before that would be like.. in 8th grade when we played Minnows and Sharks in gym. And that's like 2 whole years without tag
yeah :D It would be pretty.. fast. Have you guys ever done that before?
Aw, maybe near the end of the season we could.  It sounds kind of scary and intense with all those fast people though. :P So... How are you today? (:
"awesome"? Why is it in quotes? :P I'm pretty okay :D
Aw, It's alright :D It's good that you guys got that finished.  Pshh, grammar is silly :P
Awww.. :( That's no fair-- I would blame it on the figurines playing hide and seek and the paper being too delicate :P  It's okay though :P You guys'll get more "bonding time"? :P
Ooh, that's pretty cool. Didja finish all those 100 cards? :P
Lol I hope that went okay :P  Ooh, so um.. You're like a super cool person :D!
cooler than you? :P no way. You're like. as cool as it gets. You're so cool that.. puddles freeze when you walk on them :P And.. Ice is jealous of your coolness :P And penguins like you.
lol yesh :P you're so cool, that you don't even know how cool you are.
aw (: Well, you're um.... still super cool :P lol
aw.. sorry I missed your messages.. I tried to leave the volume up loud enough so I would hear the little facebook chat sound, but I guess that didn't really work out :P
Cool :P
Ultimate wish! :D kind of.
lol 'I would create a time machine for you.. but that would probably take longer than 12 hours.' It's okay though, It means more at 11:11 pm anyways :P
aw, do I know what that same thing is? And what if today has some super majical wish powers or something? ;P
Aw :D I think the same thing applies to days I get to see you :P  So, I slept for like 12 hours tonight :P
lol :P That's one reason why snow days are so awesome. The second reason is that no school part :P
lol key word "could" :P but saying no to you would be like... saying no a million super cute puppies :P or saying no to this: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S-8Tkuy4yWI/AAAAAAAAC5E/xAawTlSI0-U/s1600/women14.png :P. no that those things are similar :P just a good comparison for how hard it would be to say no. not that* :P typo.
I know! It's just so sad and crippled and cute. like.. really, what kind of person could turn that down? :P
haha yes, exactly :P  so, I feel like today is going to be a really good day :P and not just because of the whole.. snow day/ 1-11-11 thing
Okay, maybe it is mainly those things :P But I just have a gut feeling.
pssh, my gut is never wrong. It's one smart internal organ :P  I don't always listen to it though.
I guess so :P Sometimes it tells me I should go do something dangerous. or risky. like um.. :P Saying yes?
pssh, well... you could die if you do a lot of things.. like skydiving. Or driving, or even just sitting in place. :P And people still do those things, because it's worth the risk. And that's how I feel about you :P
lol I could say.. 'ya' or 'si' instead of yes :P And then it would take the same amount of effort as a 'no'.  Nice idea though.. You would totally be worth the risk :P lol whatever that risk is
lol :P It's alright--my mom kind of didn't let me go anyway...
me too :D
aw, really? :P I probably do too.  I doubt my mom would let me out of the house though.
So it's like :P um.. moderately in between being fun and not fun? :P
haha, I found this-- and I thought it would be funny to post on your wall :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzfyU7B4DWQ 
lol :P so.. It's snowing kind of crazily right now.
lol :P sorry about that. It was very honest of you to reveal that though :P
Haha :P Good idea. It has a nice ring to it. Or.. Honest Ace :P
lol I know! :P but still. Poor kangaroos.
haha whoa, that's like super amazing! :P I think I'll have to ask him about those some time.
lol :P did you miss looking at that picture or something? Those poor kangaroos... :P I would be such a bad non-profit organization leader.
haha :P I guess cuteness is normally what gets people to support causes in the end. I'm not sure how I'd stack up against those cute homeless puppies though. :P Omg. those commercials with the sad looking animals always make me want to donate.
lol I guess once you know the music that goes along with it, you could get a heads up to when the sad animal pictures start and flip channels :P But in the back of your mind.. you'll still know that all those poor animals are out there all alone in the world and can only depend on your generosity to help them....  haha, maybe I'd actually be alright at that whole non-profit thing.
psh, well homeless animals would be an easy cause to get people to donate to.  A harder cause to work for would be like... a fund for Kleptomaniacs :P or the civil rights of llamas.  But anywho... :D yay. No school again. :P
lol very very very exciting :D
aw, :P That's no fun. lol I guess we do have that meet on Friday though.
Track practice? :P or you wanting to take off?
lol I guess so :P hmm... would you be able to do anything like.. after practice? :P like.. maybe watch that Back to the Future II thingy or something else? I dunno :P
:D aw.  lol Well It's okay if you can't too, because I'll hopefully see you at practice :P
Not to mention that you're a really awesome guy and you would just make the whole thing 80000 times awesomer? :P
:D Wait, so.. you're definitely going to track, right? :P
Okay :P me too. lol see you soon
You're such a cool guy :P
lol I did :P you looked so cool with the headlights shining on you and your glasses and everything.
:D It was super fun for me too. You're just like, so awesome! :D
lol pshh says you :P but I guess it means the most coming from you anyway. Anywho though, um.. um.. um... :P
umm... um... um... Hi :D
haha wait, how do conversations go again.. was it... 'How are you?"?
lol :P And then I would say... "That's good. :D But what a coincidence, I'm like, feeling super fantastic as well because I just got to see this one really amazing guy." :D
I think so too :D We're getting pretty good at this :P   So um.. G'night moon :D and sun. Even though the sun goes to bed really early :P
lol :P It's alright. Haha I think I slept too long to say good morning back :P So I'll just say... You're awesome :D
:D lol Good afternoon to you too. haha, I'm not sure how possible that second part is, But thanks :D
It's hard to explain, but just about everything you do always seems really amazing/ awesome to me. (:
Oh It's fine :P lol Why so serious?   Have fun and stuff :D
Whoa, I hope it was indoors :P I heard werewolves and opossums and similar creatures are lurking outside at that hour.   How did it go? :D
ooh :D!!! I wanna seeeeee!! :P lol  sorry
pssh, I'm sure the unedited version is fine :P lol maybe..  But whatever you do... don't forget the bloopers :P. Unless... you were so perfect that you didn't make any :P
Oohhhh I see :P kind of.  That sounds very cool though :D
Adventures are fun :D
:P lol I guess it would've been pretty cool to see in person.
:P lol Nice. So, I have'ta tell you something tomorrow :D!! Something cool!!
It's like.. so cool.. that I think you'll just explode from the coolness :P But like, a metaphorical exploding.. cause I don't think anyone wants to see that :P   but yeah, cool.. and tomorrow.. :D
:P lol you said 'shucks'. aw, why does it say 'sorry' at the top?. Oh yeah :P I remember this :P
oh, it's fine, you're not bothersome :D   aw, but... I'm not so great to dream about... dream about.. cute little puppies and unicorns :P  but yeah, goodnight (:. lol the awesome thing that wasn't so awesome..
(: It's alright, It's nice to know, even if it isn't true :P yes, I disagree.  Bye :D
A little, but I think I might've already told you :P. :P... well.... *no comment*
I'm not really thattt predicable though, right?. That's good :P It was a letdown.
:P haha So.. I'm like cumin?    Well.. you know what I like about you? :P. lol really? .... really really? :P but they always let you down..
Me either. :P. lol just kidding :P I do know. You'll find out eventually though :D. :/... aw.. does that mean.. that you can only go up from there? :D
Me either :D. That's good ish? :D I'm kinda still worried though :/
... aha :D
I dunno, I can't help it.. I think I will be anytime you're not really happy. :P you too.
:P no way. You prepare to get happy. :P
Just like you doubt the whole girlfriend thing? :P
Well, I still believe :D
:D or maybe two people. like.. you should too :P
Well, I bet it'll rain soon :P
Well, Monday calls for a 20% chance of snow. And snow is a form of rain :P
It totally is :D But yeah, so.. I saw you like.. yesterday!!!! (:
Wait, really? :D I would very possibly like to :D lol hmm.. Mean Girls is playing on ABC family today at 6 :P
Really now? :P
Sounds like my relationship with Back to the Future :P
Oh no, I totally like it :D but I think you liking it makes me like it more than I would if I saw it normally? like.. I'm not sure if I would've ever watched it if it wasn't for you. :P lol, sorry, it sounds rather dramatic.
lol well, it's not a bad movie, is it? :P I mean, I thought it was pretty good.
Pshh, old things aren't so bad.. like.. that "Ballad of Bilbo Baggins" thing was just amazing :P If it didn't have a date on it, I would've thought it was filmed just yesterday.
Maybe you were :P or maybe, you're actually like... a 50 year old guy who looks 16.. like.. a vampire  o.o
Definitely :D! Haha people with insanely blonde arm hair sparkle in the sun :P
lol :P It's alright, we'll see when it gets a little sunnier and warmer outside :P I think I first noticed this crazy phenomenon on a blonde guy named Joe o.o It was so weird.
Whoa, yeah! I'm not sure if we'd want to know though :P They could be like.. anyone around us.. o.o
Whoa o.o You're right! lol considering your taste in music and everything
lol, sure :P A lot of people say that the classics are the best though.
lol everything meaning, not country? :P
:D! Hmm.. how bout.. Eminem? :P
haha :P I'll assume you're kidding and not take offense to that :P
Were you? :P lol it's alright, I don't have any major attachment to Eminem, but his music brings back memories :P
haha nooooo :P When I was little, I listened to the Real Slim Shady :P. And I did stand up whenever that song came on :P Not really.. but I did in my mind.
.... I do.. :P
(: Aw, that's pretty. ooh and it rhymes :D! A lyric?  Have I ever told you that I really really really really like your eyes?
I'm not sure, but I like yours quite a lot (: ooh, that Goot person wrote that one song.. about loving someones existence :P I'll have'ta listen to that other song you quoted. Well, then...  I really really really really really like your eyes (: They're all twinkle-y and pretty.
(: Thanks.  I'd still argue that yours are prettier though. And I'd definitely rather see yours. :P
lol, I guess you're right :P maybe we should see each other's eyes more often.   haha :P I think I'm pretty good at these creeper pickup lines.
:P I like yours. They sounds all smooth and cool 8| and stuff :P
(sound*) lol :P They're not really cute though, they just sound that way somehow :P. So, I'm guessing that you're hard at work studying? :P
(: lol it's fine, psshh, who needs studying anyway? :P  psst..... You rock. :P
You can have mine if you want :P And yes, you totally rock :D like.. you rock more than a rock! or a rock-star! :P
Haha :P Yeah! You rock more than Patrick-Star in rock form (:
(: I dunno, but I think I kind of like having the guy I like tell me I'm cute :P  It's probably the most un-true thing that I'm willing to hear. :P. ooh, and I'm gonna listen to that, like.. right now (:
Aw, that's like, one of the cutest songs ever :D It's really nice (:
Well.. I think you're cuter than that song :P And I think you've already written stuff as good as that song (:
lol :P well, they might've been easy compliments.. but I really think so :D
(: Aw, really really? Well, If I think you're awesome, and you seem to think I'm "adorable", what does that mean? :P
:P Not just awesome though.. like super amazing awesome! With a cherry tree on top. :D (Just make sure not to let that anywhere near George Washington.)  Hey, maybe I'm indirectly helping you study for US history :P
lol, whoa!! I didn't remember that part until just now :P I hear that hippo bites really hurt, so I hope that George was not a biter.
Haha, Yes :D Just like a beaver! I can imagine it now... :P
:D But how much wood would George chuck if he had teeth like a hippo and could chuck wood like a wood chuck?
lol I don't think he was very efficient. I'd say a wood chuck could chuck at least half of a forest, y'know.. if a woodchuck could chuck wood. :P
pssh, it was only like.. 13 colonies back then :P That's like.. 13/50th of today's country troubles. I'm sure George had plenty of free time to chuck wood :P
lol Good thing I'll get to brush up on this stuff when I take U.S. history next year :P  Wait.. how many more colonies were there than 13? :P
Aw, looks like we'll never know why George Washington didn't chuck his share of wood :P Anywho.. I think I'm gonna get to studying and sleep soon, so G'night and stuff (: Good luck on your exams :D! And um.. I really hope I see you tomorrow (: No wait, I will see you tomorrow, definitely--so, in that case, I can't wait to see you tomorrow :D
I totally saw you :D and it was fun.. Okay.. um.. sorry to ask.. but you're a guy, right? :P  What do you make of this?: "Blake Parker January 23 at 9:53pm Report Hey. Please excuse my complete lack of premise on this... I don't know you that well, but I'm interested in hanging with you at some point. We could talk about music or politics or religion or school or nothing at all. Would you be cool with something like coffee or a smoothie in the future?  Don't be afraid to offend. Would rather have nothing than something with false foundations. Don't view this as anything in particular, simply two people getting to know each other. so yeah. Let me know, I guess."
I mean, I guess so. :P I just wish I knew like, if he normally sends these types of messages to people he knows nothing about.  :P  sorry bout this :P Maybe this is something I should be discussing with friends who are girls. :P
lol :P I didn't notice that it wasn't right until you pointed it out :P but maybe either way would work.  Have an awesome sleep! :P
:D lol I hope you're having fun at the orthodontist's :P
Oh cool :D Those things sound fun (: What'd you do in Radford?
lol really? aw, how can you go somewhere and just do nothing? :P
:P haha. Well I'm sure that you made just everyone in your company happier (: So that's kind of doing something.
pssh, well. I'm sure they were happier on the inside than they would have been without you :P
I know!!! And that would've made a lot of people very sad :(
You know that's not true :P They would be in the hospital right beside you (:
no way, they would skip school just to make sure that that heart monitor is still beeping (:
Well. Their parents would be at the hospital too. Just waiting to see that you're okay.. Haha sorry, did that sound creepy? :P
:P Well fine, maybe it's not very reasonable. But I know everyone would at least be very concerned about you.
Sorry I'm sending another one of these :P I like the lyrics though, especially at 1:05ish.  They kind of remind me of you :P ish. 
That's good :D me too (:
Aw, sorry about that :P  Ooh, so... 2 hour delay :D That's really exciting and unexpected :P
Lol yeah :P That gave me a nice 3 hours of sleeping in (:
That's good :P lol I got up at 6, got ready, heard about the delay, did my homework :P went to sleep, heard about no school, and then I passed out until 11 :P I kinda wish I had woken up earlier though.
lolI guess so :P but I feel like I got too much sleep and wasted part of my day. :P
Well.. like. maybe I'd be fine with not getting that much sleep. :P
lol :P sleep is the bestest :P but I dunno how it compares to like.. being awake :P I mean, you're kind of limited when you're asleep..  And It's fine :D
Well maybe real life is better than anything I can dream up :P
lol Well I can't control my dreams :P So ya know, last night I just dreamt about some really weird town where people kept stealing the public vending machines. :P
Lol, would you like a world with no more on-demand snacking? I mean I guess it would put an end to fumbling with straightening out dollar bills :P but still..
Oh yeah :P Definitely. I can imagine all the people haggling for doritos in shady alley-ways.
haha yeah :P but then again.. Drugs don't make you fat :P lol just kidding, doritos are definitely better :D
lol :P The nacho cheese smoke would be awesome!
ooh yeah :P lol that would make secondhand smoke not so bad. Maybe it would benefit homeless people :P
yes! :P for all we know, dorito fumes could be the most filling thing ever.
lol :P yeah! But who knows, I think almost everything is considered a carcinogen these days.
:P Whoa, it's like we were thinking the same thing :D
Haha :P I'm not sure how great my mind is.
Well I like yours :P It thinks cool-ly
lol :P brains can totally be cute :D I'm not sure if mine is though. :P But thanks. Pstt.. how was the yogurt? :D. This brain is sort of cute. :P  
lol :P Wasabi is very.. strong-flavored :P
:P Yeah, I think earlier today, I had this conversation about how weird wasabi is... It's like.. amped up dijon mustard or something :P Did you actually like it?
haha :P I haven't tried it since the first time I had it, so I guess I didn't like it or something. :P I kind of want to try some now though.
:P That sounds.. beautiful :D
.... :D  I should be more careful when I throw around words like cute and beautiful. :P
lol :P Well. I like you.
Aw, that smiley always reminds me of a kitty :P
lol :P and a body maybe :P but other than that.. That is totally a cat.
awww :D! It's so cute :D!!!. ()() (. .) (")(")   All I can make is this bunny :P
lol I like it's tail :D It's adorable.
:P It's not as original though. I think I saw it somewhere once upon a time :P
Oh thanks. I think your kitty is really nice. If it is a kitty. I mean, it said 'meow'.. but you never know. :P
haha, I can see that. Like.. those ears and everything just scream dragon :P
:P lol! And I bet the 'tail' is like.. some dragon spike?
:D!!! It's just so obvious. And that circle on it's tummy is actually where it breathes fire?
Aw.. :P I thought I was on to something.
:D That's good. I guess I'll get effort points then?
lol I like those :D Real brownies are nice too. (The dessert, not the girl scout :P)
:D maybe you should. lol just kidding.
Yum :D!
aw.... :P
true. :D. haha, I think I feel like eating brownies now :P And seeing you- Seeing you would be nice too :P
Whoa, that would be like. Just amazing :D
You seem like a pretty skilled person. :P
lol It's okay :P I always just use the mix.
Whoa, that's intense!! :D Well, home-made is always better.
only most of the time :P
lol :P Well, I've never tasted anything you've made, so I probably can't comment :P I have a feeling your stuff would be just amazing though :D just cause it's you..
like, whenever you make those homemade brownies? :P
Yay :D Brownies are so yummy.
It's weird though, I have trouble eating chocolate-y stuff without milk :P
oh yeah. :P Chocolate without milk is alright. But triple chocolate brownies without milk is tough :P
:D! lol.   So.. Today is Sunday :D!
Oh yeah, it is pretty nice outside. (:  Have fun and stuff! :P lol in the sun on a Sunday.. (:  
lol :P Yeah, it's like, adorable :D!    haha, my day was um.. interesting. :P I hope yours was really really nice too. :D See you tomorrow!
(: That sounds kind of fun and contradictory :P  oh, me too. :P I don't think I've said "How are you?" quite enough today. Or "I like you"...
Oh I dunno.. because I could sort of still like you. (: Aw, I'm sorry to have deprived your day of those. :P How are you now? :P
:P lol really really? That's pretty cool. :D What kind of neat thing?
Aw (: Well that's perfectly believable--I mean, who wouldn't like you :D Well, I hope you get home safely and everything and did not end up having to walk through scary alleyways--And if you did, then I'm really really sorry for not giving you a ride. :( But yeah, I had fun seeing you and stuff today. :D G'night and see you tomorrow! :D
lol :P Hopefully running decreased your chances of getting mugged. I guess it depends on how in shape the mugger is.. but I guess they would go for a slower target. :P  aw :P sorry about the air hug.. I didn't know what I was doing. :P Nice typo by the way. :D Ooh, and that's a nice song there. (: It's pretty. lol And maybe a little better than that John Mayer one?. The lyrics are really nice (:
Oh, I just saw that one message up there ^. Lol I think we sent them at about the same time. :P But um, no, you are most definitely not bothering me :D
ooh! I really like this one song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkpFv8mC5gg I hear that it's a Christian song, but I sort of like to think of it as more of a love song for someone. :P . Aw, I don't think you could possibly do that, you're like.. too cool of a person to. :P hmm.. I think the word is.. "suave" :P
:D Well, it's hard to compare just lyrics to a whole song. And I refuse to believe that, mainly because I've noticed that your self-criticisms aren't all that accurate :P
Whoa.. That's really cool :D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And you saying your self-criticisms are accurate is a self-criticism too :P And therefore, it's totally not accurate. Like.. you did write lyrics! you totally can sing (I think.), and you're pretty attractive.
Oh yeah :D! I wanted to get a better look at that album cover you made :P I think I saw some bikes and kites, but that could just be my imagination. And I'll have to listen to them myself--You seem like a pretty honest guy except when it comes to yourself. :P I think. Or maybe, since it's what you believe, it sort of is still honesty.. but um.. yeah. :P  I seem busy? I'm sort of the most un-busy person ever. Except when I'm near some project due date like I will be tomorrow. :P I guess I never really say anything important, but it's still cool seeing you and stuff..
Haha :P Alrighty then. Are you sure it's not the other way around? :P
:P Well I just wouldn't know what to say if you told me that.  But um.. yeah.. Good night :D
That's crazy :P But awesome!!! That's super exciting!! and ooh!!! Country-style gravy is just like.. the most amazing thing ever (:
You're a person, not a thing. :P But you are pretty amazing too.  lol :P It's like... yummy and stuff! Those southern people have a great dinner/supper down there :D oh um.. and breakfast and lunch too.
You are amazing! lol I guess we are kind of considered in the south to people up north, but we still consider people from Kentucky and Tennessee to be more southern than us. :P Oh yeah! I'm actually really really really really really really really excited for that this year. :D Aw.. you would've been good at the open mic! :D
Nah :P I'm mainly just excited to write cheesy poetry in English class and to get my learners (assuming I don't fail :P). You?
Well.... You never know. :P And definitely! :D like those.. Roses are red, violets are blue.. ones :P
:D My day has been really good (:. lol I should probably start this one essay though..  How about yours?
Aw, that's not so fun..  That's awesome! :D I'm bad at writing things. :P  psst.. what were you wondering? :D And I like that cheesy poem of yours--they should put it in one of those Valentine's Day cards :D I hope the one I write for English is half as good :D
Oh :P
Oh, it's not. :P
Well, maybe it is fantastic. And maybe I'm just all happy inside :D
That would've been one of the best things I've ever found out before, if I didn't make it so complicated. :P  Aw, well.. maybe you'd get the best response in the world. Depending on what response you'd be hoping to get :P
I'm not sure :P I'm not good at these things. And I'm really not good at talking to you.
...:P Are you sure you're still talking about me?
Haha, I don't think I fit that description :P
Do you seriously like me? I still can't believe it. :P But yeah :D See you tomorrow.
That's very impossible.:P Maybe you just 'fall in like' easily? Night night :D
lol :P no, I totally did not notice that fail-but I think it's cool :D! And so are you! :P
:D Oooh, superbowl is tonight :D!!! And it's gonna be awesome! :P haha, too bad none of my close friends watch football :P
haha, it's fine :P
like.. it's fine as in you don't have to. :P I wouldn't want to make you watch football against your will
I guess I should've said this earlier, but I sort of did make plans sometime between 11:41 and 2:34 :P I would definitely have liked to watch with you if I hadn't though. (: Who do you think will win?
aw..... Well.. maybe... :P I don't know... I'm sorry..
Hi :D
(: I'm very good :D! I think I slept too long though. :P How are you doing?
:D that's really really good! (I mean the well part :P) Oooh, is it that guitar man painting?
Awesome! I hope it turns out being the awesomest painting you have ever painted :P
But.. I thought it was an effort grade :P But either way, It'll look very nice :D
oh. well. maybe the teacher will make an exception because it'll be so good :D
That is an extremely good excuse, considering that you were actually there :P
aw, well, that's a pretty good grade anyway :D!
That's lucky that you did bring it :P i bet that voice inside your head was helping you out. I guess it's sort of hard to transport a large piece of paper around though. maybe.
It made a lot of people happier, because they got to see it while you carried it places. But i guess you don't need to carry a painting around for people to be happy around you :D
:D lol. maybe.. you need more doughnuts. :D
Wait no :P I guess what i was trying to say earlier is that you don't need doughnuts or paintings to make people happy.. like.. just you being there can make people happy :D because you just.. radiate awesomeness.
haha :P Radioactiveness would be good for that upcoming neon day. You totally have awesomeness though.. it's like.. all around you.
ooh, like how the moon is only as bright as it is because of the sun? :D Maybe we can be like those two.. they seem pretty close.. the sun and the moon I mean :P
haha :D! yay! I think you'd be more like the sun though.. I was just in the dark until you showed up and cast your awesomeness on me :P
lol :P Well you're brighter and prettier than the sun! :D
:P noo.. not what I meant. I'm want down at the bottom of that pretty scale, same as before-- lower than the star-nosed mole, and higher than politics. Because politics are really not pretty at all :P
lol :P That's a great song.  And thanks I suppose. But I'm still not agreeing :P  I hope that Sunday/Monday/ anytime thing works out :p
haha, I'm glad you think so, otherwise I would feel pretty badly about wanting to see you so often :P
Good thing that is most definitely not the case :D
And that just wouldn't be cool.
haha, of course! And good thing it actually did snow a bit :D
haha the screenshot on that just looks awesome :P
the song is really nice though :D. lol :P good timing on that. Jinx-ish? with the word nice..
:P Nope, that only on a double-jinx. Sodas are yummy though :D
nah :P   lol Max and Roxanne. Would it be weird if I remember something weird that you said?
maybe something about Roxanne :P I won't say it though, just in case it actually didn't happen/ is wrong
oh, okay. :D Good to know I didn't just imagine it.. If we're both thinking the same thing :P but um.. anywho. You're a very very very extremely cool/interesting person :D!
:P Okay, maybe I did just imagine it.  And I'm glad you think so too! :D!
lol :P I won't say it, it'd just be awkward. Really? :P Well, if you think that's awesome..
...just wait 'till that Valentine's day thing then. :P Hopefully that'll be as awesome
Don't worry, I'll try to make it awesome either way :P
Oh yeah.. me neither actually :P  lol "good" weird sounds nice. We can either do all that cheesy Valentines Day stuff, or we can do everything completely oppositely, if that is possible :P or just do regular stuffs. i don't even really know what people do on that day. Valentine's day sounds like it's a day for valentines. :P hmm.. I've never seen that movie "Valentine's Day" :P
lol :P That's neat. I remember I wanted to see it because it had the two Taylors in it. :P pssh, I think we could totally handle that :P
I wasn't aware that I do much thinking :P Yes :D movies with you are most fun. Or maybe that's just because it was something as excellent as Back to the Future :P
Or you+Back to the Future! :P
Whoa, is that even possible? :P Haha i would say the same for you, but it was my first time seeing them :P maybe if I were to watch them again, it just wouldn't be the same..
Maybe :P Too bad I don't have the DVD trilogy set :P
Aw :D I'd be honored. But I just don't think it'd be as good without you there :P
Well, you don't need to watch it, because you can just play all the scenes in your head. :P
aw (: but nah, I'm not worth your thought space. :P
Can't have that :P I like your important stuff in your thought space :D
And stuff! :D!
:P That's like saying that... homework is important. :P
:P lol I totally thought you were agreeing with me for a whole .2 seconds
I wasn't aware :P
I knew it!!! :D!! That doesn't mean you're not still totally awesome though.
:P Don't worry, You're always totally awesome. Except maybe Febuary 29th :P But nah, even then, you're pretty cool :D. Hmm, I just attempted to make a rainbow cake :P
Definitely :D! Except maybe.. Me and you.. :P haha sorry, I should stop with those lines.
(: lol that makes me feel better about saying it. :D
:P Well, it's not too unlikely, considering I have recently sort of become very um.. in more-than-like with you :P
whoa, an exponential really? :P That totally beats my x68.   (: This is cliche, but I like you sideways 8.
Whoa, 3 variable problems? :P I think I learned how to do those last year, but I've forgotten. Haha, sorry for sounding nerdy, It just looks so mathematical.. This might take awhile for me to get :P. The middle part looks sort of familiar :P
Aw (: yay. Thanks for saving my brain from that math. :P ..And for giving me some of these:   }|{
yeah! :D And like, that feeling where your tummy kind of does a little flip? :P I sort of like that feeling.
Yeah :P Kinda like a variation of that roller coaster feeling.
:D! Like, almost exactly like that :P
You must visit theme parks a lot :P
Aw :P lol I wish I was brave enough to go on roller-coasters :P i think talking to you is better though (:  Travelling by way of tortoise? :P
:P lol oh, okay..
haha :P That's kind of funny.  hmm.. this guy actually looks pretty quick.. . You can come over whenever :D
Oh, i found a copy of it--but you could always bring it so we could go for that classic vibe :P  Don't worry about it if it's hard to find though
Okay :D yay! see you soon. (:
:D You're so so cool! And the weather outside was super nice besides the crazzzy wind :P
Today was nice too. (: Well, the weather was :P I hope you're okay and everything... (:  At least you got a break from school though :P Unless you were there and I just wasn't aware.. (Yay, rhyme :D). You're too awesome to let the magical elves [that live inside of you and make cookies] get you down.. Sorry if that doesn't make much sense. I was going to say 'germs' but then I remembered that you don't have those :P
:P  I hope you are too :D I'll send some invisible chicken noodle soup your way--I heard that helps out sometimes :D Are you feeling alright and everything? Oh yeah, ten minute break just wasn't the same...
Like... dead as in open-casket-funeral-dead or dead as in zombie-dead?  I wish I could help or something.... I'm not much of a miracle worker, but I think I know what I'll wish for tonight :P
It's alright, Most of my other wishes don't normally work out, and it's weird, but I really don't have much to wish for.. well, besides all that stuff like ending world hunger and malaria..
Nooo, don't let it fade away! :P It's totally possible.
Aw :D lol That sounded... majical! (: And it sort of made sense.. ish :P I wish I knew what the message before that meant though :P
:P The one at 6:36pm. 6:39**
I think I maybe sort of got the gist of it :P Either that you are wishing to be magical.. or that your wish is magical... or I am completely off and you actually meant that you wish the world could be a more magical place for birds and the woodland creatures and such :P
Ohhh okay :P That's what I thought you meant when I was sending my response :P Good thing that worked out and everything. But yeah, anything is possible if you just believe (:
(: Aw. Well, I guess it does depend on what you're wishing for a little... like say you were wishing for world peace, world fullness, and world healthiness-- that might be just a little out of reach for awhile :P  But if it is remotely possible, then believing is good.  Wow, I'd be such a bad Dr.Phil/Oprah :P
Well, then I'm glad I'm the way I am :P
(: You're like, a major self-esteem booster; it's still not believable though :P I wish that they still played re-runs of the classic Winnie the Pooh on TV :P
Well thanks (: I will try :P  Whoa, that's awesome!!! :P At times like this, I wish I had a VCR. Ooh!!! I love those VHS rewinders!!! They're so cool! :P I think I had a few that looked like cars.. and you would like put it in the 'hood' of the car
You had one too? :D awesome. the convenience of watching VHS's? It could totally work somehow :P I mean, I'm sure there's one lying around somewhere..
Oh, haha :P yeah.. I guess they are sort of bulky and stuff. But I could probably spend hours playing with one of those car rewinders :P Maybe..
Yes!! totally! :P I remember when I was younger I would sit in front of it and watch it rewind :P
:P pssh.. are you saying that it wouldn't be as interesting and compelling now that you do know about computers?
Ohhhhhh :P I see. lol good point. Maybe you should start doing cool stuff and playing outside again :P
I would :D!!! Especially if it was with you. There are just so many possibilities :P Ish.
Oh yeah :P hide & seek is sad with only two people. I really like sardines :D   So um.. You need to get better faster. :P Can I still bring soup?
Oh well :P pssh, if you're feeling better--then maybe I should bring like.. um.. I dunno :P What do you give people who are feeling better? But yay :D that's really good.
Haha, well I'll see what I can do then. :P
Well, maybe I want to (:  Again--if only I could drive :P
Oh yeah, it's actually still sort of warm :P I think.. And yeah (: It was super blue and clear earlier today! :D
:D!!! Friday should be awesome. But who knows? It could randomly snow storm one day :P Blacksburg is so weird when it comes to weather.
:P lol yes!  Ooh, and I learned yesterday that we'll be having a long weekend (: Thank you George and Abraham :P
:P Lol today as in just now? Well I'm glad that I'm able to tell you some good news then :P
:D Thanks. I think... :P lol should i be taking this as a compliment?
Nah, I think It worked.. ish :P  Aw, I feel really bad for saying that I was "definitely" going to track.. Because like.. I missed the track bus.. So I walked to Kipps.. and my mom wasn't there, so I called her and she came and picked me up.. Then we went home first because my mom wasn't fond of taking me to track.. Then she said that she would take me, so we went. But then I couldn't find the sprinting team, i only saw the distance people. :P And then I looked in the Rec center, but all the rooms we're normally in were empty. So then I went back to the car, and then I ended up practicing stick-shift for the first time in the old BHS staff parking lot. :P That was interesting.  And then on the way back I noticed the sprinting team was there.. but it was already 4:40ish, and that's normally when we start abs, so I didn't think I should bother. :P And that is how I ended up not going to practice. Sorry for that long story just to explain one little thing. :P
Aw, i hope your knee/leg in general is only. Because I'd like for you to be ambulatory for the rest of your life :P And I hope your friday is going very well (:
That's really really really good. :D  And thanks--Fridays are awesome! (:
Aw.. are you cooped up at home alone? :(
Well.. Hmm :P Do you like.. um.. Truth or Dare Jenga + American Idol in the background + 1999 shooter games?
That isn't not a confusing double negative-type sentence :P But I hopefully get what you mean. Hmm.. are you free? possibly? :P
Oh.. as in.. You would need a ride? :P Sorry..
No way.. walking is just..  bad :P well.. in the dark.. through downtown.. on a Friday night especially.
oh my goodness, you're just like.. Awesome! :P
:P No way, you're definitely fun and cool and stuff (: I'm really sorry I couldn't stop laughing :P
:P Well that's good. Because I have trouble not doing it. lol Asthma laugh :P  So, I think you should be called "Chuckles" too :P  Because that's what you do. I think :P
:P Oh it's like.. Morgan Evans nickname.. So I guess you could say that I wasn't all that original :P  I should come up with one that fits you bette. I think you're very Peter-ish though :D
lol wait really? :P Oh yeah.. peter is like.. a word.. 'to peter?'  'petering'? :P  But no.. In your sense, it means um.. I mean, haven't figured the whole thing out yet.. but mainly awesome (:
:P It's that Peter Hernandez guy!!!!
oh yeah :P I bet you've been using that statement long before he put it into lyrics. :P
:P Aw. well.. I think you're amazing like.. how you are right now. Like, if you want to be perfect, then you don't have to worry about changing or anything, because you're already perfect. And y'know, when you're all happy and smiley, it just makes my heart stop for a while, and then it just seems like the whole world is stopping, and like, looking at your amazing smile. And you're just, awesome :D
Awww (: I think that worked. A lot :P And I understand the whole melting thing. Because I think that sort of made me melt a lot. (:  There's like, something about you, that just makes me want to be with you and talk to you for hours about just anything and do anything. You're just.. so coollike that :P
Aw yay! (: You make me want to hug stuff and smile a bunch. :P  (: Like right now :P
lol :P I'm not sure if it's just because of the drowsiness though. Because being sleepy also induces hugging I think. :P Like, do you ever get really really tired, and then you just want to like... cuddle up with a pillow and some blankets and just doze off? :P I think that's how I feel.. but I'm also thinking of you :P So it's like, a combination of those. If that makes sense at all :P
:P Didn't sound creepy at all.  Since I'm probably just as creepy :P
:P lol. That sounds great.  (: ahh I really really like you. :D you're just.. soooooooooo (insert the most awesome/positive word you can think of here) :P
(: butterflies tickle sometimes. :P  lol! I think I have to watch that sometime. It sounds pretty funny. :P And it has that Glee guy in it. G'night cool person :D
Neato :D Aw... I like you so so much. (: Sleep well.
:P lol aw (:  I slept pretty well, I keep having weird dreams though. :P  Have a nice day and stuffs today! :D
lol definitely weird weird :P
lol :P Actually... just kidding :P I can't actually remember all of it--but I remember it being really disturbing and stuff :P hmm.. how often do you remember your dreams?. So, I like um.. think you're cool. :D  Sorry I say it so often..  But you are :P
Whoa, that's kind of interesting. :P ooh, are they in color? :P  Hmm.. I feel like I've never had a real nightmare before. :D aw thanks. lol you should think it about yourself too, maybe. :P
:D That's so awesome! lol. I think I have before too, because there was something I remembered specifically about a purple hat. :P Whoa. Sounds scaryish. o.o Like spiders. and eh, I guess so. :P And maybe you wouldn't be quite as cool then.. even though it's hard to imagine you being not as cool as you are now :D (which is pretty cool)
Whoa, I hope you don't get hurt too.  Maybe it'll help you get better somehow? :P Have a fun run in the setting/gone sun :P (:
:0 aw, really? :/ That's not very good. But at yeast you had fun, right? :P
Aww.... You sound so.. injured. :( But who needs ankles and knees and calves? Like, there's always that one guy who won the Olympics with no legs. See, he didn't need legs. His heart was what was really important. And his brain. And arm muscle maybe? :P  But yeah. Anywho. um. Oh yeah... It's okay if your legs are all dead. Because you're awesome without them too. :P  Have a super duper spectacular night :D Yay! I hear fireworks :D. And see them :D I love college towns. (:. hmm.. I wonder what the occasion is. Maybe some Pre-President's day hype? :P Anywho, yeah.. Sleep well and everything (: And I hope that you don't fall out of bed and that your breakfast is super yummy and that you hear some happy bird chrips in the morning. :D It was so weird! The other morning.. like.. when I woke up, the blanket was all sideways. :P I mean, maybe that wasn't that weird, but normally it stays the right direction and everything, y'know? :P ooh, so I also hope that your blanket stays in the right direction as well. :D  Bye friend! :D lol it's funny when you accidentally leave out the 'n' in friend :P because then it's just 'fried.' :P And "Bye fried!" just sounds silly. :P But I guess fried food isn't very healthy so you'd probably want to say goodbye to it anyway to prevent myocardial infarctions.  (lol that means heart attack by the way :P) I don't know why people don't use that term more often. I mean, it'd be a great song lyric or something.  "And when he crossed the room and flashed a smile, I felt like I was having a myocardial infarction. And it wasn't like the painful kind you get by eating junk food by the pile, but instead, more comparable to reading Huckleberry Finn." Yup. I can just see that song taking the number 1 slot on the billboard charts. :P It'll be a hit one day. Wow, I should probably stop typing now. It's kind of difficult not to though because I keep thinking of more stuffs. lol It's feels sort of weird though because I'm really just talking to myself right now. ish. :P I'd be sort of amazed if you were dedicated enough to read this whole thing. Because when I see large chunks of text, I sort of just get scared for awhile. :P I apologize if this large chunk of text has a similar effect on you. So um.. I like you. (: Fo sho.  Bye :D (I'm trying really hard not to type anything more) :P Oh wait.. I just did. But okay, I'm gonna stop.. like... rightttt..... Now.
Aw, that's not too bad I guess. (: lol now I'm wishing I had written something more important/interesting though. :P (: Yay. Fo drizzle. :D You're like.. crazy amazing. :D
:P lol pssh, being crazy isn't so bad. It's um.. fun :D As long as it's not like psycho crazy. :P Word to your mother!. ..As Vanilla Ice once said. :P
lol cute silly sounds silly. :P You're cute.
Aw, that means I can't be mean to you. :P Not that I normally would.. but being mean to a cripple is just like 5x as bad :P  My day has been really really awesome :D And I keep like.. imagining that i smell fruit loops. :P And fruit loops are one of the best scents ever. I wish i had some though :P How has yours been?
:P pssh, well uneventful days can be good too. Aw, it's fine. ooh, do you have some at your house? :P
Awesome!!! Do you ever just like.. open the box to smell the fruitiness? :P haha I bet you could like, use them as an air freshener or something. Maybe if you put a fan behind a bowl of them :P
:D!!! lol I hope the fruit loops aren't too light.. you might just end up with cereal all over the floor :P. but at least they'll be pretty colors and stuff :D
:P lol That could work.  :D
:P lol That's probably an even better idea :D. I remember that they changed the spelling of Fruit Loops to Froot Loops because they didn't want to confused people into thinking that there was real fruit in them :P That was sort of funny. Hmm.. I wonder if toucans even eat fruit. :P Aw, sorry I was kind of unresponsive for that while :/
tidbit is a cool word :D lol and that sounds surprisingly fun.
(: Aw... Everything feels all suspenseful now. :P
Awww.. I think I literally missed you by like a minute :P  Good night then I guess? :D I'll talk to you later. (:
(: You're the bestest.  Sorry for asking this a bunch.. but are you possibly free tomorrow?
Cool :D It's weird that tomorrow is a Monday. :P
lol yeah! Me too. :D I wish tomorrow was like.. Saturday or something. But I guess that would be too much to ask of the Earth and the Moon. :P lol I learned a lot from the most recent Charlieissocoollike.
Yup. :P It was some fun science. I like the faces that he put on the planets.
:D yeah! And a cool like teacher! :P  You're just super duper amazing (:
redundancy is okay sometimes :P I think you're super duper spectacularly awemazing. :P
(: Aw, yay. :D I won't accept it though. :P Dentists are cool sometimes.
Awesome. :D Mine gave me some cool sealants.  And my day has been really really good. I made my first omlette today :P That was kind of neat.  How is yours going?
Well even nothing sounds fun with Gap :P  ooh, that's exciting ish. I suggest you eat lots of peanut brittle and apples beforehand. :P Spacers don't hurt as badly as people say as long as you don't chew anything with them. :P Protein drinks are nice.  Aw, well, I hope it's spectacular tomorrow (:  I just read two chapters of a war book which focused almost entirely on this one guy who got his leg amputated and ways dying on a hospital bed. o.o But i'm still okay i think :P
Oh yeah, it was just a joy to read :P lol did someone hire you for a party or something? :P Or was everything other piece of clothing you had unavailable? ooh, or was it a dare? :D I love the name Wallace though. I think I recall having a Purple Pigeon named that :P
Aw :D that's so nice of you. :P I wonder what kind of project needed a red and white guy :P
:P Ohhhh. that makes a lot more sense.  Yo estoy buscando for the elusive 'Camiseta blanco con arayas rojas' Donde esta Wally? :P
:P Oh yeah. I was sort of in a blank thinking of spanish words. I'm proud to say that I didn't have to use a translator. :P  I'm kind of scared for Spanish 4 next year. It sounds like.. tough.
Oh yeah :D I guess that's the brightside. that was probably part of my reason for taking the class. I'm not all that great at spanish though. :P Spanish 4 would be like.. taking it to a whole new level.. (literally) :P
:P pssh, you don't see me at all times..  lol :P sorry.. I know what you mean.  And I definitely don't kill puppies or anything when you're not around.. :(
:P whoa.. I thought you were talking about killing puppies at first. Please don't do that. :P  But on a brighter note.. um.. um.. It was President's day today :D
:D yeah! I learned that James Polk was president. Even though I sort of knew that before, but couldn't recall his name :P ooh! and we have 44 presidents. I think. And definitely :( It's one of my pet peeves.
:P I bet you know your presidents pretty well already. Oh yeah :P I noticed that when I was typing it. That's kind of funny :P well..as funny as dead puppies can be..
:P I'm not sure... it depends on the context.. like.. if someone randomly said "Dead puppy" during an awkward silence with a really straight face.. I would burst out laughing :P
:P lol something like that. And because it's just such a terrible thing to say, that it's funny. But maybe that fits in with the random thing too.
That's good.. because I have trouble with that sometimes :P
That too :P but also what i'm saying.
:P Or maybe it's just so meaningful.. that I don't have to ability to understand such genius.
Maybe meaningful stuff is genius in some situations :P  But either way.. the stuff you say is pretty amazing.. I hope it goes well at the dontist guy :D They put the spacers on surprisingly fast :P. Oh my goodness. :P I can see Justin Beibers eyebrows!! It's weird. Sorry. Just though i would um.. pass that on. Because it's pretty interesting/funny. I like how this type of news spreads so quickly. :P  . But yeah. um. Talk to you later today hopefully :D! I think I'm gonna go eat some food and maybe a doughnut :P. Sorry... I don't know why I tell you these random things about my life. :P Well I do.. but sorry for it :P
lol. Sorry about that again..It's unbelievable news for some reason though. :P It would be comparable to hearing about Lady Gaga suddenly dressing normally.  :D yay. lol I'm not sure if you'd want to know me better :P And nah, I just could only stay for the meeting--I didn't have a ride back from the high school if I stayed any longer than 3:30.
:P Or maybe it would just make you dorkier somehow. Not that you'd be dorky to begin with :P
:P Maybe like.. if you were wearing glasses, then that might make you a dork. But either way, you'd be an incredibly awesome dork. :P  By the way, I really like you too :D You're a cool guy.
Good night :)
Aw, I missed saying good afternoon to you. :P I mean.. it's still technically afternoon.. it's like.. always after noon if you think about it. :P but i think I can say good night again. :D :D yay. Lyrics! And they're good :D!!! I still want to read them more carefully, but first, I feel like I should mention that when I saw them in the preview of the message, I thought you were sending me lyrics to a Taylor Swift song :P
Oh it's fine :D Doctors are cool people too. Mine wears glasses, I think. Or if he doesn't, I imagine him to be the kind of person who has eyes that need glasses :P lol It's totally a good thing. It means that you can relate to millions of teenage females.
:D lol hmm.. you don't exactly seem like you need glasses for some reason though.. And it's not because you're not smart :P Maybe I just imagine doctors to wear glasses. Or just my doctor. :P And I hope that 2nd statement wasn't sarcastic. Because that is definitely beneficial. :P Taylor Swift is awesome at it. Or so I've heard. :P
:P lol. I'd say you're lucky.. but me liking you doesn't exactly fit in that category. :P  And females aren't that cool so you're not really missing anything. :P
:P lol way to totally contradict what i was trying to say :P Maybe we just have like.. conflicting opinions or something. :P
Oh it's fine, I didn't mean it as a bad thing.. just a reason why we were contradicting. :P  like.. it's hard to argue for opinionated stuff. So I didn't bother on that one. :P
Wait. no. :P I take it back, it's totally fact. And fact is, I'm not all that cool. :P
:P Whoaa! Do you remember that Nickelodeon show way back when that was called 'All That'? :P
Awesome!!! I actually pulled it up on youtube and am currently watching it. :P I don't think I remembered the name that well, but the theme song and the show are super familiar!!
:P Whoa. I've never ever heard of that show before that I remember.  But I guess you would've been a bunch older than me at the time anyway. :P Nick had so many good shows back then :P
:P Maybe All That aired longer. lol the ones that come out now are disappointingly uneducational :P I feel like I learned a lot from shows like The Amanda Show.
(: Lol yes!!! Knock knock. Who's there? Fryin' pan. Fryin' pan who? I'mma gonna hit you in the head with a fryin' pan. :P Drake and Josh totally still plays on TeenNick. I think I've out-watched that though, because every episode that they show is something I've already seen. :P Same with Zoey 101. I haven't gotten into that 70s Show ever though. :P
Oh, oh yeah.. I guess like.. they stopped filming :( I think Merry Christmas Drake and Josh was the most recent thing. :P  lol :P Episode rewatching is awesome (: I think those are called like.. marathons. or non-continuous marathons if you don't watch all of them at once.
:P Ah, I feel bad saying this again.. but I wish I knew what Good Burger was :P It sounds very um.. good though. :D for lack of a better adjective. Due to my inexperience with the show. :P
Whoa, this is some crazy new information. :P I wonder if I've seen that before without remembering it.... Aw, I don't think I've seen it.. maybe we possibly could sometime soon though? possibly? :P
Yay (: I like watching movies with you. They go by like.. really really quickly.
:P I'm not sure.. I think clocks suck it up and use it to keep going.. like maybe that's how wind up clocks run.. off of the energy exuded from the hours that are used up :P
Yay (: Does that mean that my theory can become scientific law? :P Maybe it could replace those 'atom laws.'
Pssh, not me :P When am I ever going to need to argue a case in court by saying that um.. um.. :P I can't remember my atomic theories....
:P Yay. (: I'm not sure if my life would be any less complete if we didn't know about atoms. We'd probably still think that we were made of the 5 natural elements or something :P ahh, I learned that people thought that back then in a science video :P
lol :P I wonder how fire and earth and wind and water and wood(?) can turn into substances :P But I guess like... earth and water is mud.. and earth and fire is um.. lava?.. and wood and water is.. rotting wood?..  And so on. :P
It's okay.. demostracles and aristotle and all those guys are in the same boat. But I guess they found out they were wrong, so maybe it's not exactly the same thing. :P
they never* :P sorry.. really inconvenient typo to make. They died instead of finding out. :P Oh yeah. I bet you were just really upset to find out that you actually didn't have a blazing fire inside of you that made up the entirety of your heart and internal organs.
:P maybe you can hang stockings on the mantle of it in the winter, and roast marshmallows over it (:. and chestnuts!
Yay (: I hope it doesn't go out either. That's especially bad for charmanders :(
lol :P They have cute-ly drawn eyes. And the sound they make is pretty cute too. :P Char :D
:D yeah! lol just don't let him evolve
:D!!! lol yay! or it can hold one of those stone thingys that makes it not evolve. like.. ooh! Everstone? :P
:P lol I wonder what me remembering it means.
lol :P Aw, you'd do that for me? :P hmm.. I feel like Pokemon is going to get really crazy advanced one day and not seem like pokemon at all. :P Like some of those newer games on the DS. :D!! Pokewalkers sound sort of fun though.
:D!!! Yeah! and like.. you could explore and find imaginary pokemon! :P I think that guy Ben still wears his at practices.
!!! oooh yeah!! :P And no one will know the race of your best friend. And like.. you could have this random guy who is your sworn emeny :P
lol :P! Maybe it's good that i don't know what region you were trying to say. :P I watched Bolt last night. :P It was pretty amazing.
:P It looks more recognizable with a 'K.'  It was awesome! :D it was so suspenseful and sad when the dog was trying to save Penny at the end! :P
Whoa. That was just so deep. :P So like.. maybe love is just as strong as any super power you could have :P
:D Yay. I wonder what happens if it's used incorrectly. :P  ooh. and it's like that beatles song :P All you need is love.. Those guys knew what they were talking about.
Definitely :D Like spiderman.. Aw, I feel bad because it did sort of start raining kind of hard. :( I wish I could've found an umbrella for you.. like.. what if you just melted or something because of all the rain?
lol :P If you were a witch type person, then you'd be the good one :D The eastern one? :P Or the 'fairy'? But yeah. I really really really liked seeing you today too (:  My day was like super duper duper uber duper amazing :D like.. because of you :D! sorry..  (: G'night. I hope you sleep pretty well too :P
:D aw. lol :P I still don't understand how I could make such an impact on your day. (: I like that song bunches. :D Aw.. I still feel bad about how it was all rainy. But at least you are, in fact, not a witch :P (I think) :P I'm totally not; if it seems it at all, it's just an illusion. :P  But you're just like.. truly super duper amazing (:
Whoa, reading this just got me all like.. smiley (: And butterfly-ey. And kind of shaky feeling too... (: Maybe you've done everything right.. and maybe I think you're extremely amazing and that everything about you just makes you a really good person who's super fun to be around. :P  (: See you tomorrow.
(: Aw. I like when you smile :P It's all pretty and stuffs.   :D I'm glad that I get to see you (: And that you're in my life :P  Here is that thing I was going on about earlier :P   
Well, I think it's amazing. (: It makes me feel really happy. And it's cute :P  lol :P I'm glad you think so. Me too :P I also liked Hermione (Whoa, I spelled her name right on the first go) :P and Ron because of their british accents, which happened to sound amazing in autotune. (: G'night and see you later.
:P oh, lol it's very fine-sorry for suggesting it in the first place. :P  Ooh! And I saw part of that Autotuning the news thing! :P Autotune is nice.. Oh my goodness, I think I'm in like with you.. (:. sorry
:D aw yay. I'm amazing. :P lol Not that I believe it. :D Arrrr you gonna be a pirate tomorrow? :P
I have trouble believing true things sometimes :P Or at least stuff that doesn't have much proof. :D and awesome! Make sure that you're one of the cool pirates and not like.. Bootstrap Bill :P Not that there's anything wrong with him
:P lol It's alright. Some things are okay with the whole no proof stuff.. like... hmm.. I believe in um.. ghosties. They're really scary sounding though. Well, i guess I don't truly believe.. but like.. they're real enough to be able to scare me. :P And I believe in magic. But I guess that Chriss Angel guy does make it look pretty realistic. hmm... And yeah :P I guess he looks kind of creepy in his 'zombie/sea creature' form though.
:P lol really? ghost and magic? What if I told you that I believe in those creepy green guys who live in your toenails that show up on that super creepy commercial? o.o Or that I believe in the United Nations and the Geneva Convention? :D yeah! Happy Endings are awesome (:
:P lol ewwy, my toes feel all gross thinking about it. aw. everyone deserves a happy ending (:
Yups, as long as their happy ending is good for everyone else too. :P And definitely even you. :D
You definitely do. :P And you'll most definitely get one someday.  :D Anywho.. um.. g'night (: I hope your day was awesome and everything.
:P Lol it's a promising beginning. I was absolutely terrible though.  :D See you on Thurday. :P It sounds so far away if you don't say it as 'tomorrow'... :P
:D! I saw you :P And it was cool!
Oh whoops :P lol yeah, it was at school. :D
It was pretty enjoyable. I'll have to tell you about it later :P i wanna hear about yours too! I'm out snowboarding still :P work in progress.
:P lol I wouldn't exactly call myself super awesome.. I'd be more like.. 'barely-knows-how-to-and-falls-very-often' :P So.. When I got home and changed.. I noticed that my shirt had been insideout the whole day at school. :P lol hopefully no one else saw that. Or maybe I could just like.. set a new trend :P
:P lol well who knows, maybe you'd be like.. super duper amazing at it.  :D Maybe if enough people did it, it would just like.. miraculously start snowing. :P Aw.. I was actually going to ask you. Like.. if I had been able to go. :P  I hope your day was awesome (: And I hope to hear some details about the concert :P Hopefully there'll be some videos or something, I was kind of disappointed that I wasn't able to go see Blake and them play.  I think I saw them at stepping out once, but I didn't pay too much attention :P
You're amazing at a bunch of stuff, even if you wouldn't say it. :P Awesome! :D Maybe they'll play again sometime, somewhere :P
Says you. :P That'd be amazing :D And I might be, I mean.. I probably should since I'm in town. I think I got pretty bruised up from all that falling though. :P Is it at the weight club?. And I like that song :D It's awesome (:
:P lol Are you suggesting that we skip practice to go have fun? :P Isn't that like.. (cookie) hooky? :P
I don't think it is :P You're fun to hang out with, so you'd probably be equally as fun to um play hooky with :P Even if I actually did tell coach that I wouldn't be back till Monday.
:P i still hope that your knees randomly recovered. That'd be nice :D Ooh, and it turns out that it did rain quite a bit :P
Aw.. :P That might not be the best for track practices. :D! It was pretty awesome! like.. water just kind of fell from the sky for awhile.
Definitely :D  The "cumberland Gap" makes me think of cucumbers :P
tee hee. Gap.  :P Do you think he likes cucumbers?
Awesome :D
:P It's fine, my sister wasn't too upset with driving you. And my mom actually suggested I invite you over again sometime. :P  And it was all cold and rainy and stuff, so it's good you didn't walk home alone. Aw, I kind of do too, but I'm mainly just glad I was able to tell you I like you (: I actually got that shakey feeling in my legs. And that flippy feeling in my tummy. I'm still sort of wondering what the thing you wanted to say was... Night night (:
:P Whoa. lol, sure it wasn't just because of your not-fully-recovered knee? :P And okay :D, I can always wait to find out I guess--unless it's something super important :P Have an awesome day (:
I trust your opinion. :D Well, then if it's important..  hmm..Important Things are best discussed by Demetri Martin :P But important stuff in general probably shouldn't wait too long to be talked about.
lol :P I think it's sad that Important Things stopped :( Hmm.. maybe the world's most cliche advice could help? :P
Yeah.. It's the only comedian I've ever majorly watched though :P Oh... and just that little "listen to your heart" bit. Unfortunately, all mine ever offers is a pretty cool metronome rhythm :P
Oh yeah, definitely. :P It's even crazier around you :P
Lol you know why :P
Maybe you'll find out eventually :P and okay, cool. :D lol are you sure It's open to guests?  and you too :)
Alright :) it sounds kinda neat and so does the movie, so hopefully i could show up. Plus, you'd be there, and That's just awesome :D bye
Aw, no luck on getting there, i tried convincing my mother, but she thought it was too far... Instead, i drove around a parking lot and did some reversing too. :P It would've been awesome to see you though... I hope that movie goes well (:\nSorry, meant to send all this at 7.24 but i don't think it went through.. But that sounds kind of neat :D. ifeel like I've missed out on seeing all the classic movies but im a terrible movie critic either way-i love bad acting, cliche humor and disneychannel movies:P. Yeah, anywho.. :P G'night and stuff. And see you tomorrow :D
Aw :( I was kind of worried about that. Was it some kind of self-prescribed therapy? :P :/ I hope you're all right
:( aw. Just think, in flat places like North Carolina, there wouldn't be any hills to get in your way.  :P  And I'm not sure if it's safe to walk around places when your knee could like randomly give out. especially not on rooftops or cliff ledges. But yeah.. g'night :D I'll see you tomorrow (:
I'm pretty lazy, so I guess I have a hard time understanding the whole walking thing :P   But walking is good and stuff.. It like.. saves the ozone layer.. and reduces obesity? oh, I heard it was moved to the 15th, but I also have heard it's tomorrow, so basically I really don't know though :P I'd enjoy it either way.
Whoa, That's even better! I love club day :P lol if only it could actually play music, then I wouldn't mind the lyes so much :P
:P lol nice. You're even better too. I'm not sure what you're better than, but improvement is always nice :P You totally could! It'd remind me of one of those 16th century poets though :P
lol not what i meant! :P I just meant that like.. I didn't know what we were referring to for 'better than'... And maybe everything is just on one level, so no ones better than or worse than anyone or anything else :P But you'd still be pretty awesome.
well you should feel better than pretty awesome.. :D
how was that osteopathic thingy? :P
Whoa! Awesome! Lol i wonder how that'll work out with braces. It sounds cool though cause you'll get to go in a giant tube :D i hope your knee is alright though. And i can't wait to see you and yo haircut :P but mainly you in general. It wasn't as bad as i thought :) the football field was just pretty muddy :P
Seeing you is super important :D especially since i still have to tell you that something :P and surgery sounds scary O.o i bet your meniscus is a-okay :D
I guess i didn't really tell you today... Sorry about that, it must be bothersome. I hope your day was amazing :)
:P lol! At first I was wondering what about that made you think of me..like, I was all, 'Wait.. I definitely don't stalk people, and I don't own a lion suit.'.. and then I realized I had told you about that cat video before :P Aw, I hope it's the minor one, because surgery is bad for you. Well, like.. it's good because it helps.. but.. hmm.. I guess it'd be worse without the surgery.. but like.. yeah.. you needing the surgery is bad for you :P  And it's not fine.. like, I'm going to tell you tomorrow definitely if I can like.. speak to you alone at all :P  :D ooh, have fun and stuff. Banners are cool. especially ones with spangles and stars. Y'know.. I've never bothered to find out what a spangle actually.. so I think I might look that up soon. :P Or not, because it might mean something unexciting and then I would've been better off imagining it as something super duper awesome :P  And it went pretty nicely I think :D Byebye for now. lol :P here's one of the videos we watched during that lockdown. It's so cute (:  . :P okay, sorry.. they're just all so cute. 
:P lol I disagree And I still feel like I have'ta tell you! :D Even though I'm bad at it. Whoa!! That's like, really really cool! I feel like you'd be really good at juggling :D
I hope your has been pretty fantastic too :P and aw That's neat :P
Lol is 'they' your parents? And me either yet :P
Oh yeah, it does :P hmm... Maybe i could make a life size sculpture out of household appliances :P
Lol :P Psh There's nowhere cool to go out to. Well... Hmm :P
Pssh, movies are overrated :P  lol I don't like that there's an SAT tomorrow morning; that means that some people are going to bed earlier than usual tonight :P
That sounds like a plan :D  (:  :3 You're so cool (:!!. And your hands are nice (: Sorry... Aw, I hope you got home okay..  (:  If it's possible, I think I got even more obsessed with you :P I'm sorry.
Aw, i think i forgot too! So i'll say goodnight too (: you're really awesome to be with. (: i really really like you! :D
(: aw.Lol i still dont believe it.Sorry i was all jumpyand nervousand stuff most of the time. :P sweet dreams(: you have cool youtube videos. Have fun tomorrow
Youweren't too accident prone today, whichis good:P i hope yourknee stops popping. Knees aren't supposed to pop. Water balloons are:P bye (: aw.Bestest friend.
It was okay :D lol I had some more "high-flying" kite adventures. Turns out it was a lot windier than yesterday. But yesterday was still a whole lot more fun even though it worked better today. :P   I hope your day was pretty amazing too :D And I hope you had fun with church activities and birthday activities and stuff! :D Ooh, and I read that poem you sent a while ago, and I thought it was super duper amazing! (: Like you :P
Aw, well as long as there were windows :P Like, if you were anywhere but in a basement, you would still enjoy the sunlight and stuff (: And that's good :P lol, at least there aren't many places higher than 7 feet that you can fall from in a house.  And it's okay, you having written it already means a bunch (:
Aw, sorry about what? Sorry i'm really bad with hugs :/  but i had lots of fun walking with you :D lol maybe we could do it again when it's warmer.. I hope you didn't get in trouble for being home late or anything
wait, really? I'm so so sorry :/ i shouldn't've like, stopped at all those places :(  and it's fine, hugs are really nice :P. Oh whoops :P lol i totally believed you.
Aw, lol :P Tommy's hugs look nice. And hugs in general are nice, just.. I dunno :P I'm bad at them.
Whoa, that's some pretty early falling asleep :P And this is some early waking up to. :P Whoever is on Facebook this early obviously has a problem :P Sorry, just kidding of course :P. up, too*
:P lol okay, that makes some sense. I think I have a Facebook problem at times :P Or maybe it's the people on Facebook who I'm more obsessed with.   I'm excited for club day today :D It'll be amazingly fun. And I'll see you there :P
Aw hi (: G'night to you too. You're so amazing (: like, i just got all these unexplainable butterflies  when i read that message and thought of you.
Well like.. everything you say is pretty amazing (: And my day is going pretty awesomely so far :D I hope yours is too
(: I like you bunches. And i hope your weekend goes amazingly :D it's gonna be super duper sunny tomorrow.\naw i had trouble letting go :P. And i sort of still have butterflies (: you have a really good Irish accent :P and scary story voice. :D!!! That is a super nice song! (: ooh, is that the one that you were thinking of yesterday?  And thanks (: lol I hope the same for you :D And I hope that you're already having an amazingly awesome time at that place where you're at! :P  (:
:D Fredericksburg sounds fun (: and so does the concert stuff! It's crazy, but it's like raining a little at this very moment. It's been pretty warm though :D  G'night and sleep well and everything (: Aw, You shouldn't be bothered with Facebook on an awesome weekend like this though :D I'll see you on Monday at school hopefully (:  Have a good time tomorrow and the day after tomorrow (Apocalyptic movie? Or was that 'The Day Before Yesterday'?) :P  Bye (:
lol :P That would've been a cool live video :P Whoa, then I could've like.. seen what you saw! And experienced all that awesomeness :P  And I was totally out that late on Sunday :P  (: I'm glad you didn't have any near-death experiences on the way home and I'm glad the van didn't crash into any power lines o.o.. (:aw, i kept thinking that you looked soso amazing and that you were amazing, and iwanted to tell you, but i don't think i did enough... So i guess i am now :P. Okay I'm sorry :P um. yeah.
(: I still don't see it, but thanks. You're super duper and I like yo yo-yo still :P. Yeah! :D I'm really glad that I got to. But really, It's fine :P You're cool
Well i was at the time, but then i got home and realized how much homework i had (and after my mom said 'no'). We should still do something sometime though :D. On a nice sunny day of course :P i really liked walking home with you (:
:D of course i wanted to accompany you, adventuring with you is amazing-even if the adventure is just through a quiet neighborhood (: i hope the rest of your. Day is happy and relaxing and fun-filled and stuff, like a monday night should be :P
:D I love Fridays. And being with you is pretty amazing too :D! especially when walking home and stuffs. Tomorrow is purple cupcake day (:. :D It was pretty moderate today. I hope everything over in your neck of the woods (to quote Al Roker) is nice too :P
hi :D how is your day going?
:P lol my day's going alright, I woke up surprisingly early and went over to my dad's house.. and now I'm home again :D
It was alright (: There was some nutella over there, so I was content :P
! :P Hopefully! lol I'm so bad at making cupcakes though. I guess it's not that hard--I'd just rather see you or something :P
aw, really? :P Are you positive it wouldn't be too soon?
!! I totally is :P except for ranch dressing. ranch and chocolate will never work out together :P
:P lol sorry for what? :D! I liked seeing you and stuff though. it was fun :D but I still can't believe that you'd never heard of cats cradle before :P. :P whoa, drugs sounds scary. But I guess that would make some sense since most of them warn you not to operate machinery. I'm glad I didn't hand you any chainsaws or anything :P
oh my goodness, I didn't even think of that. scissors are some pretty heavy duty machinery. I'm so glad that nothing dangerous happened :P   by the way, reading your message out of context sounds pretty terrible :P
lol :P maybe it was more of girl's game then? :P i mean, I thought i knew quite a few guys who did. I'm not sure though. :D you're such a cool person
(: thanks :P i hope yours is amazing too :D
Oh, it's okay :P You had pure intentions, so your awfulsoundingness is forgiven :P
Thanks (: here's hoping yours was just as amazing :P spider encounters are soo scary! :P G'night
Especially in enclosed areas like cars :P
oh i'm okay :P but mainly just because i didn't get a close up look at it. It was so so so scary looking even from far away though! :P
Lol maybe i can explain the whole story to you later :P and yeah! It's so so warm and nice out there :D. I wish i could just like, go lie in a giant kitty pool and drink lemonade out of a coconut :P oh, and be outside while all this is happening
:P lol! Yeah! Trees are fun :D and break anything but your bones :P
Whoa. The word 'pain' and that happy smiley just don't seem to go together :P hopefully it's a little better now? Maybe?
thanks :P yeah, it felt kinda of like someone was following me around with a giant spray bottle :P or one of those mist-er things. See you tomorrow  :D
Definitely. I'd like to go with you (: are you sure you were serious though? Like, isn't the prom normally for couples? :P Sorry, kidding ish
Aw (: dancing with you sounds fun :D even if i'm absolutely terrible at it. :P and being a couple sounds nice too (: You're so cool. :P
I bet you're awesome at it :D You're good ish at walking, and dancing is about the same as that, right? :P
Yeah, i guess we'll have to wait until some day in May :P and it's alright, random things are nice sometimes. Hmm... Is it... Someone i know? :P
(: you probably wouldn't believe me if i told you how excited i am. :P Whoa, it's you? Does that mean that you're going to the concert?! :D
well you best believe it, matey. :P sorry, it sounded piratey so i thought i should add that to it to make it, like, more authentic or something.. And Whoa, That's like, the best seat in the house! :o hmm, i heard that Drew was wanting to go to that concert :P
:P lol Is Drew not the kind of person you should sit next to for 2 hours straight? Pssh, he's not thatt fat that he needs two seats :P sorry, kidding. But if you gave them both to him, then it would no longer be the best seat in the house. :P Aw, I wish I knew where that art show was. :P Not that I would have had much of a chance of going.. but it's nice to dream :P I hope it went/is going well :D
lol :P Even at a Ben Folds concert? And awesome :D I'm not sure that I've ever heard of that place. It sounds super cool though :D! Sorry I wasn't able to go. I bet your artwork was pretty amazing to get put in a "Museum" (:
:P lol thanks. Maybe I just have a really bad memory :P I think I had seen the "Montgomery" part, but I just linked that to the "Montgomery Regional Hospital" for some reason :P  And that's still cool :D Whoa! That's really really cool/exciting! :P
Oh thanks :P aw i liked that thingy you sent last night
well it was really good :D even if you don't remember :P and awesome!! I heard it got put inside and out of the cold :D and that there was awesome food.
Yeah, that one thing :P and Yum! (:...To the food, not the crowded thing :P
It's fine, it was cool :D lol maybe like, you could tell the goodness of it from all the amazing smells :D
:D that sounds very fun. It's like you got to have a sampler or something. :P Lol Gap is so funny.  and the meet was a lot.... ... More fun than i thought it would be! :D some of the freshman distance kids are really really cool!
:P sorry to mislead you- i had to split the message up due to the strict 160 Character limit
Ah i'm sorry! I was really narcoleptic last might. We should like do something today because it's so nice :D
:D aw Yay. I'm free after 3 o'clock. What about you?
Awesome :D. So.. :P lol sorry, too soon?
:D It's okay. lol I enjoy that hypothetical reaction of yours :P  And I guess that it wasn't too late. :P You're really cool! :D
its okay, it's not toobad really- i'm juston probation.And it wasmy decisionto stay withyou (which i dont regret), so i willbe holdingmyself fully responsible:P
It's really nothing too too bad :P but sweet dreams to you too (: how are you doing?
aw, only okay? I guess i'm alright (: lol :P just "a little" off? Sorry :P kidding. But yeah- it was super duper windy too. I hear it'll be very stormy tomorrow. i have like, the weirdest feeling ever right now :P
Aw, i'm sorry i kept you so long. But i wish you good luck and goodspeed with that. :P and yes, it's very weird. Anywho, G'night and i'll see you later (:
:D I'll be sure to check out your pieces at the art show tomorrow. :P  Aw, you weren't at school today exactly..
I was like.. unsure if you were there or not :P because there was this slight possiblility that you could've been.
Well.. I mean.. I don't know. It'd probably be the smart thing to do. :P or like, maybe you just so happened to miss me by like a few seconds every time.
Aw (: :P i guess it depends who you ask.  And I still hope you get better soon :D I hope your T cells and B cells and WBCs all get together and have one big Get Well party for you :P
Well, I trust your opinion (on just about everything except me) :P And you're welcome (: I hope you feel amazing in the morning so that I can see you at school tomorrow and at spring festival (maybe) and everything. (Sorry, it's a bit selfish of me, but I sort of do miss you a lot--You seem to have that effect on people :P ) G'night (:
:P maybe I should. But that doesn't mean that I will. :P And it's okay.. you're like awesome anyway :D It's a bit disappointing, but I still hope that you'll recover and stuff (:  And nah, I know Drew was like, seriously missing you :P  It's really really really really really nice outside :D!!!  hmm.. ice cream is good for sore throats, right? :P sorry, kidding.
hi :D! whoa, so I like, saw your dad at the thingy. and I heard you were around somewhere as well
o.o whoa. this message thing is weird.
o.o well, were you?
or maybe you were a pigment?
!! I saw it! :D It was so cute, I saw a little boy voting for you
:P lol yes it was cute. Aw, you were there?!! o.o awwww I would'n't have been bothered in the least. Did'ja catch the variety show? :P 
well.. talent show, if you prefer :P
the interpretive dance was awesome :D
I can't believe that like, I didn't see you o.o
!!! are you sure you were there? I mean, I think Dusty said you were in the library or something, so I went to check it out, but like, I couldn't find you... But I mean, I did see your father, so maybe it makes senseish
awww. It is like I just missed you :P
:( I always knew I had bad timing :P So does this mean you're a bit well-er?
That's awesome! :D and it is :( 
! :( awww but like, I would've really really liked to see you and stuffs. 
:/ well it's okay. I just like, can't believe that you were there the whole time. It wasn't thattt crowded that I didn't notice you, right? :P 
aw, several times? I feel so oblivious now :P I'm sorry, I should've like, been looking out or something. And because that guy happens to be very awesome :P
oh. well :P I sort of kind of meant you?
that's okay :D You're still awesome! I could maybe even bring like, a chalkboard or something for you to wear around your neck if it's really that bad :P
Well, I still feel bad. Missing out on a chance to see you is one of the worst things I could do
But in my opinion, you're this pretty awesome guy who I really enjoy seeing :P And that makes all the difference
Yay :D !. exclaimation point! :P
*ahem** like yours? :P
But all opinions are true :P unless you don't mean what you say. wait.. hmm.. I mean, all opinions are true to those who are opinionating? 
:P lol. Opinions are nice. . sometimes. I like your opinions :D. sometimes :P
Well, I like them most of the time, except when you opinionate negative things about yourself. Because those are normally most definitely not true
:P I beg to differ. You have to be wearing the smile on the inside too :D
:P Maybe one day, that'll make sense. to me
Well that's okay, some of the most thoughtful and insightful things don't make the least bit of sense :P
okay :D 
swallow?. lol okay :P
I'm really terrible at swallowing pills :P
Whoa o.o lol I'm still on chewable vitamins because of my inability to swallow :P And just because they taste better.. and you almost died? O.o
That's a little scary/ironic. Because like, meds are supposed to be helpful :P  !!And yeah :D they come in so many flavors and taste like candy. I have trouble sticking to 2 a day :P
:P I know! I guess this is why plain old swallowed vitamins are more common. . Those are a little bit less tempting to overdose on :P
:P You're not boring :P You just are actually skilled enough to use them. or um... eat them :P
!!! yes!!. you could. 've like. gone up there and swallowed some pills :P And everyone would been so amazed
:P oh you're right. well, maybe as long as you bring all the paperwork. and maybe some kryptonite, then you'll be fine :D
I mean, it wouldn't be too bad. Like, if you don't feel well then you'd probably be better off staying home? :D
:P That might be a little bad, but I'd still say it's fine if you need a break or something :P . Fridays aren't so bad though
:P aw, that sounds pretty cheddar-y, but it's nice (: I wouldn't want to either
aw wait.. you honestly? It's okay though, I sort of liked hearing it (: . You're pretty amazing, Peter (:. sorry
:P mental jinx then? :P
It's okay, I think I was just as much a part of that failure. I still feel pretty bad that I didn't catch you there :(  
I still wouldn't say it's your fault. Head down? like, you were laying low? were you afraid that those cops would tackle you and your medications? :P
aww.. Yeah, I think I know what you mean :P Those germ guys are probably still following you around :P  hmm, what would you compare walking to? :P
I definitely know that feeling :P I think.. You're cool ;D. :D *. aw, I think I may have to get to sleep in a while though so that I can hopefully wake up early :P
:P oh, it's okay. maybe you're just like, a step ahead of yourself. hmm, what did you not say that you'd have to be sorry for? :P
:P oh! lol not exactly--I was a bit short on time when I got home, so I just used a box mix. I did however, put some extra chocolate chips in them :D  I still would really want to make the real ones though :D They sound yummy.
:P lol That's a good point. Maybe one of those surgical masks and some gloves would have kept them safe? :P but whoa. I bet someone could like cause an epidemic with infected brownies :P
:P you're technically a hero!. :P
like, I should be learning about you right now for history rather than that Lenin guy :p. whoa? :D
:P well in my mind you're still pretty close to the greatest person on Earth :P 
then it fits a super nice guy like you?
's not butter. :P. me either.. like, how can they make something that butter-like out of veggie oil?. It's just.. unbelievable.
:P wow. if you honestly think that's funny, then I'd love to see you at an actual stand up comic show :P
yeah? :P. lol well okay then. That answer is just vague enough to be acceptable :P. but I'm afraid that I still have to get to sleep
(: You're unbelievably amazing (: (like that butter) :P sorry, not funny anymore. But yeah, g'night to you too (:. and bye
yup, ho ho hopefully (:. byebye
oh :P Sorry. Did I say something like that?. that's weird :P. Hi there :D
Pretty good :D lol I just ate some corner brownies that I had left. how are you?
:P aw no brownies? :P Well, I think I might have a few left..  ish kinda?
whoa, sorry :P I kind of just died for awhile. but not much, just doing some 'chores' and messing around on an instrument a bit :P Whaboout you?. what about*
aw, nothing at all?. well like, i'd really really like to do something with you :D
You're not boring though :P
oh yeah, I heard :( that doesn't sound very possible though :P
:D awesome. ah, I'm sorry, I should probably go. I'm really unresponsive at the moment
okay, almost done :P
whoa, storm!
it's sooo weird! and loud :P
O. M. G!!. I can't see the sky :P. it's too rainy
noooo. :P you could still come over maybe? :P if you were up to that idea?
:D I do like it, i think
nah, my mind is about the same :D and I do know, just my room is a tad messy :P
:P lol are you sure?
I mean like, you could get a contusion or something by tripping over a godzilla type action figure :P
:P!! lol that may make for an awesome epithet :P . epitaph :P  . *
oh yeah, of course :P. hmm.. "twas only Godzilla who could take him down, though twas not in the caliber of his spirit nor in the longevity of his heart that could be more Godzilla-y than he". meaningful and senseless at the same time :P
:P oh yeah, I think the twas'es are what make all the difference though
yay :D . now you just need some Godzilla related death :P
:P Well, come one, come all then. There's still the possibility if you'd like to brave the weather.. and maybe if my mom obliges :P
:D yay. . brb
:D!
wait.. what's the first thing? :P. or the second?
oh, she said yes :D
yeah :P. whoa. I love thunderstorms (:
I know! :D it's crazy :P
positively positive :D
alright cool :D So I'll see ya soon? :D
oh hi :D. it's raining :D
whoa, where were you?
oh :P that sounds rather suspicious.. I hope he didn't get kidnapped :P. you know how much those people like kids in lumberjack jackets :P. lol if he was wearing that
aw. You're totally worth it :D. and more
:P psh, how is that good?
oh :P well, maybe that is good then.. :P I hope I like you more than Drew. does. yay thunder :D
si :D. and yay :D. I went to Roanoke today :D and listened to Star Country :P
yeah :P . I heard that tomorrow is going to be very very very sunny (:
me too (:
:D song material?. it's pretty
:P lol it's cool, what song?
:D oh cool, that's a good band 
aw, like the lyrics, or the tune?. is there a violin in it? :P that's a sad intrument
whoa!! :P double sad then?. ish
aw (:. I like the xylophone type things
teehee :P did you watch the animated version?
it's sort of cute. but still sad ish
:P if you so desire
awww :( it is sad
me too :(. :'(
wait don't! it's not completely sad... :(. because he's happy that she's happy? :P
oh.. :P no, I'm fine
aw, well thanks for worrying about me? :P. Rain is so nice :D. hmm.. what are you up to this very second?
Random music is cool :P like that snow patrol song
just trying to learn that McCartney song :P. and watching that Faking my Own Suicide video to reminisce :P 
:P lol no, I used to like the song a bunch, so it's like an old memory :P. hmm, I think it has harmonica in there :P
:P to? whoa, acoustic version? :D! this is news. Hmm.. have you seen the animation for this one too :P. ?*
:P That's neat. It's alright if you haven't though, I feel like it really doesn't add all that much :P. It only helped me realize the lyrical genius behind the "love more than six feet deep" line :P
:P It's like, the deepness of a grave. sorry :P I'm slow
:P . whoa, it's sort of late
no :P I was just wondering where Saturday went
:P Well those days are nice too :D!
lol :P like you?. sorry, idding. what'd you do? :D
well, eating is fun, and movies are cool too :P ! which ones. nah, you're not boring :P And whoever said you were was definitely kidding
noo :P I was kidding too
or are you?. maybe like.. you could be so boring, that your boringness becomes interesting?
... are you saying all this with a smile? :P
:P that totally makes it unnegative then. but still, you're like.. awesome :D. I think I'm gonna go eat dinner.. or something :D. got anything cool planned for today?
:P lol maybe that squires thing with Drew will pop up again. . :P and I'm not. You're like, wayyyyy awesome.. bye :d. :D. have a nice day (:
aw :/ why won't you?
Well, if you say so. but have fun anyway (:
:P doing nothing?. or whatever you do :D. you could make fun out of nothing :D
:P well I think talking to you is fun too :D. hmm, how would you rank the colors of the rainbow? :P like, from most favorite to least?
lol :P way to not pick favorites
:P it's okay, they're not listening. :P lol or a better reason; colors don't have feelings :P. aw. now I'm worried that they do :P
I know :( I'm sorry.. I was just curious :P. so?
favorite colors? :P. lol sorry 
:P Nice :D aw, now I'm feeling sorry for the less favorite colors :P
! :P I'm sorry! I didn't know how real it all way. was*. like, I thought you were just kidding about the whole color feeling thing :P
yay (:
aw :(. but, but.. I can change!
aw (: . :P thanks.. lol, the chapter we're working on in Spanish class is about apologies, and they have some of the most cliche ones :P. like, "I can change" and "I didn't mean to" :P
oh yeah, I guess you're right :P. ah, i gotta go. sorry, bye. :D have fun still
aw, why are you sorry? :/ . or, what for?. sorry :P . but yeah, have a nice night and all (:
oh thanks :P
:P I still don't know what for. *what you're sorry for
well, I like talking to you (:
:P are you still thinking that you're boring?
Well, I beg to differ :D
:P how did your unboringness lead to me being amazing? But anywho.. :D didja eat anything cool today?
Whoa!! :D!! like, from scratch?. that's kind of fantastic
!!! :D
!!!!. That's really really cool :P they do have some pretty awesome recipes. lol is that 3 minutes of prep, or 3 minutes to cook?. :P
! nice!
I think I may need to try making these :P i could go for some fast brownies. brb though, I gotta go eat some cake
:P lol sorry, that sounded weird
well like, I left it out, so I should probably go eat it :P not like I just got some weird cake eating urge :P
or some medical condition like  cake deficiency :P. aw, really? :P I feel so accepted
(:
smiles make the world happy (:. and when the world is happy, it smiles :D
(: aw. That just made me smile :P. (: and you being happy is nice
:P You're welcome. I don't really feel like I've done much though.. :P I like Adventure Time
(: Well then maybe I'll just smile more often so I can make you happy :P . lol It's actually hard not to smile when I'm with you
Aw, why not? Smiling is good for your soul :D lol it does sort of make your face hurt though if you do it too much :P
So I've heard :P. lol . !!!
Well, I like it (: Which may be bias, considering my infatuation with about everything you do :P And the whole muscley frowning thing reminded me of something :P  
:P what if like, some frowny person was told that and they were like "Oh I know, I just want a stronger face :P"
:D It is pretty cool! like you!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11. :D . This is amazing news.. And? How was it?. :P. I'll try not to be too disappointed if you didn't like it :P
:P . aw. well. Microwave brownies are probably just too good to be true :P. I have yet to try those Betty Crocker ones you can get at the store :P
:D!! That my friend, is the power of nutella at work :P
:D I always knew you'd come around :P
:P That's fine, I'm just happy continuing to believe that there's no one out there who doesn't like nutella :P
:P Still don't believe that though.. aw :(. I'm sad.
It's okay, it's not too bad
yeah.. I just snapped my guitar string during the tuning process :P. and now I'm sad I can't play.
it's okay, I think I can still get by somehow, though I lack the joy of music :P
I know, like.. a world without music is like.. a world without nutella :P. or you
You're totally right. like, I feel the same way. I've found a string, but it's the wrong one :P. I used it anyway.
oh, it's fine, it's just taking forever to wind :P
:P it doesn't sound exactly right... I wonder why..
Well, like.. I used the wrong type of string :P
:P Sorry, I was just questioning your memory. and not understanding your sarcasm :P. I'm bad with those things
aw, you shouldn't. :P sarcasm is difficult. for me
aw :/ that's never a good feeling.. was it that brownie? :P. or the nutella on it? (hopefully not :D)
:( 
I think people would care.. definitely.
:P Well, I am a little. But like, I think I get that feeling sometimes too.. like.. you want to know you made the most of life? and that like, what you does matters?. and you kind of want to know that you made an impact on stuff?. and that like.. you'd be leaving something good behind?
aw, do you mind me asking what?
aw, that sounds kind of like.. interesting. I hope that they're okay.. :P And nice picture
:P oh thanks. Well, I would fall under the red portion of that pie chart. so maybe it's understandable
but you are :P so, no need to waste a perfectly good wish on that
(: you're so out of my league though :P
so way, yes how :P
while I'm playing catch with my dog :P . and a frisbee. and I don't even have a dog :P
:P aw, well, you're lucky--but not because I'm really in like with you :P
(: aw... . sorry, bad timing, but I gotta go help my sis. g'night if i don't get back soon (:
okay, that didn't take so long :P. did you ever have a Gameboy advance when you were little? :P
:P that's kind of interesting.
I missed out on the 'gameboy mini' :P
:P I think a lot of people did. maybe
most likely :P. I remember that little thing they had about it being the size of a pack of gum :P
maybe it's because it's not true :P. and yes, that makes sense if you think about it :P
(: it's okay.. aw. I really really really really like you too . I really liked yesterday (:. :P I'm really sorry though
:P well, for like.. getting all up in your personal bubble :P and popping it. 
:P lol okay. I'm still sorry though.
:P did you mean *fine?
oh (: aw.. I feel very similarly about you. you're really really fun to be around :D. and I like your singing too (:
:P aw, I'm sorry. I'll try to provide some background music next time?
:P you mean, your amazing voice? And I was trying to feel the vibrations from your singing :P it feels cool.. lol :P 
no way, I'm not sure i'd ever think that :P
(: It's hard not to :P
:P nah, that's something completely different. it's this little thing called... crazy :P
ahhh, i really like this one rap song, but I don't know why :P
:P ah, well.. it's called Don't Push Me by 50 cent :P the lyrics are a little terrible though, besides the first stanza :P. lol wow.. I have really weird taste sometimes.
please don't judge me :P
:P lol if you say so. The song is very terrible though :P . I think I just like the gunshot sound.. I would do well at a firing range
I'm sorry too! . like, really sorry :P. still.
well, just for yesterday still :P. I don't know why you should be sorry though. you've been awesome :D
but, you shouldn't be sorry for anything.. I really loved being with you :D!!
:J well thanks, I'm honestly not though... OOh! :D. so I think I've decided what my favorite 'rap' group/song ever is :P
yes :P
I'm not sure if you'd approve though
Run DMC - It's Tricky :P. might just be my love for SSX though :P
... whoa, really?. :P. y'know.. like.. hmm... they do Walk This Way too?. familiar at all? :P
:P yeah, that one. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-O5IHVhWj0 :P If you'd care to listen to something that you might very well dislike :P. wow :P
I'm thinking how much you'll possibly not like it :P
:P 
:D!!! yay. It's so catchy!! :P. sorry.
whoa, really? :P
not to mention that one snowboarding videogame that I know it from :P
:P!!! whoa, and they're drug-free, so that makes them even cooler!!. lol possibly the only rap song that says that
:P If this is old school rap, then me too
"We are not thugs we don't use drugs but you assume on your own  They offer coke and lots of dope but we just leave it alone" :P lol, I love rhyming. really? :P but the music video is recent ish?. sorry, no question mark there :P
o.o! really?. well.. I guess the copyright does say 1986... but like.. :P I don't believe it.. Is that really Penn and Teller in the video? :P
:P It's okay, I'm just as not-knowing
ahh, rap is so cool! :P . mainly just because of the fast-talking and rhymes though. country is cool because of the deep voices, twang, and yodelly noises :P
:P . lol. Honkey-tonk-ba-donky-donk-donk
you don't have to be sorry though, like, you're really cool :D. and you don't have anything to be sorry for.. I'm sorry though... and I'm sorry for being a hippocrit :P. hippocrate*
surprising that you're really cool? :P
:P psh, who said anything about that second part?. sorry, kidding :P
:P everything?
oh :P   And because, i truly think you're amazing :D. And I like the way you think and stuff. And you smell nice :P 
oh definitely :P. sorry :P we all know the 2nd part is the mostest important though :D. :P "I want a girl with lips like morphine, knock me out everytime they touch me" teehee these lyrics are so silly
omg i know! that's so much better for knocking things out :P
:P oh okay. Glad you're catching it now then? :P. (: Music is so awesome
:D I think you're super amazing (: . hmm, have you ever had a bromance? :P
:P whoa now, really?
I'm not :P I'm actually a little curious about that bromance thing. it is pretty late though. care to explain? :P
the bromance?
:P I'm not too sure. I think it takes the form of something like those scenes from "I love you, Man'
:P is it still in progress?
oh. aw :P now I feel kinda bad. there's still time to hop on the bromance train though :D!
oh my goodness.
!. I'm so amazed :P
by Queen... like.. :P!!! okay, like.. I just looked up the song "Crazy little thing called love" because I was wanting to listen to it, only to discover that it was by Queen, which I would never have guessed. And that's when it hit me that they are one of the most diverse bands ever. like, you could listen to a bunch of their songs and never know that they were by the same band :P 
yes. :P! and knowing that the "crazy little thing called love song" is by them just gives me a totally new respect for them. because I really like that song :P. and 'The Show Must Go On' and 'I Want to Break Free" are just like.. amazing.. oh my goodness, I'm just like.. so amazed :P. sorry.
did you not know all these were by Queen either? :P omg!! and Under Pressure!. Ahh, they're so cool! :P
oh thanks :P I feel a little stereotyped now.   :D! and that's cool.. wait, really? :D you like them?
:D that's really cool. !!!
ohhhhhhhh myyyy goooooodddddnneeeesss!!!. !!!!. they sing this song too? :P!!!. I officially love them :P. I thought some different 70s bands were singing all these.. but no. Queen was behind all those old songs that I love :P. like, "You're my best friend" :P I love that one
:P lol yay. I accomplished something.. something good hopefully?
aw (: :D. You're my best friend too
catch... what? :P
oh, I think I might have missed it then :P . I'm still in amazement.. whoa. So that's who Freddy Mercury is!. :P. I really like Another One Bites the Dust too.. :P sorry.. um.. yeah.
I know!! I keep like, clicking on all these Queen songs in the "related videos" sidebar, and for most of them, I'm like, "Whoa! This song is by them too?" :P
lol at the moment maybe :P but this kind of excitement only lasts about an hour max :P And I still think you're amazing :D . Sorry :P it's still pretty late though, so. I should probably like get to sleep or something :P. hmm.. you know what a floozy is right?
lol :P a lemon tart? or a pop one?
oh nothing :P I just heard the word in a queen song and I was like, "whoa, I totally know what this is"
does this mean that Queen is british?
O.o. whoa, really?
o.o :P lol yeah, I was like.." but nothing this good comes from America". even our cheese is just like.. recycled stuff :P
:P lol way to bring yourself into this. I definitely wasn't referring to you when I said that :P
:P I was thinking about bringing that up :P
do I?
oh :P . well... what about like.. hmm.. George Washington? :P
:P. WAit!!!. I have one!!!. Oprah is American! :D!!!. and hmm.
yes. :D. and Clint Eastwood.. And um.. Sylvester Stalone?. James Dean :D! Elvis, Marylin Monroe, Humphrey Bogard. These are the heroes of American history :P
oh yeah, totally :D. ooh, I forgot to mention, Audrey Hepburn and Frank Sinatra (:. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omg!. this is what Bohemian Rapsody is?!!!! I'm so amazed now :P. okay, sorry :P
:P well like, I don't know titles most of the time.. I think I had Bohemian Raspody confused with that Nirvana song :P
si :P. I was just such a confused person before :P
:P oh yeah, maybe I'll suddenly be better at history class now that I know about the magnificence of Queen :P
:P still don't know better about that.. It's just even more clear to me that you're amazing. and wayy too amazing for me. like, I don't deserve you
(: nah.. it's just unexplainable :P
at least?. that like.. such a cliffhanger :P
oh, aw.. well I think that you're perfect (:
(: but what if you are the best?. like, you're really amazing.. hmm. Ever heard the song Fearless by Pink Floyd? :D
:P lol maybe just in your opinion :P And that one tis my favorite :D. somehow
ohhh :P well still, Maybe I don't feel like I deserve the best..
(: well thanks... That's nice of you to say. I wish I knew how to play cricket :P. it looks like a cool sport
yeah :D it looks like a mix between soccer and baseball :p. from what I saw. ah, I should let you get to sleep :P And I should get to sleep too
:P lol to hear me talk about Queen songs your were already aware of?
(: aw.. I like talking to you :D. but yeah, g'night and everything :D. I'll see ya later 
g'night :D I kind of like the smell of shaving cream
:P It is! And you don't have to apologize :P  Bye bye :D
:P It is. Ish. well.. It sounds kind of like a forest.. because of the word 'lumber' :P. but like.. hmm... and slums are like, ghetto neighborhoods... so like... :P
o.o whoa.. that is really creepy.
oh no.. Now it's in my head!. ahhh. :P
Some things you should jsut keep to yourself :P. it was nice to hear though :p. not the voice, but you talking about the voice
 it's cool. :P Now I'm surely going to enjoy mine slumber  whoa, I suddenly feel all narcoleptic o.o maybe it's the sandman's voice? . :P and okay, g'night. Enjoy thy slumber? :P
:P nah, it must've been that creepy voice thing
:P lol not if it's just the friendly old sandmand. sandman*. I need to play old school Mortal Kombat with you sometime :p
! :D
whoa! That's really cool :D!!!. :P lol mine isn't quite that oldskool. just PS1
oh, it's fine :P
lol :D I love those. and that sounds really authentic :p
I like you (:
:P I have that weird feeling again
Well, I kind of like it (: But I'm not sure whether it's good or bad :P
maybe :P. Actually, yeah, I guess so. You're so cool (:. I wish it wasn't so late :P
because then I could talk to you longer :P. sorry, it's a silly rason :P. lol :P raisin
if it wasn't so late, you mean? :P
oh, yay :P That thought makes me want to go to sleep. what about your bromance though :P. ?*
:P I'm going to totally disagree with that 2nd part. "girls come and go, but friends are forever" :P
aw (: okay, you got me with that. but still.. It's really nice talking to you :D
(: but what about you? You're like.. super duper duper amazing :D! It's almost like the word 'amazing' is too ordinary for you :P
(: And it's extremely true. ah, the clock keeps telling me that it's later/earlier :P. so I'm gonna get going so we can both get to sleep :P. G'night super duper amazing person (:
:P Your awesomeness is even crazier to me than my Queen realizations :P
(: I really really really like you too (:. G'night Peter (;. (: *
:D oh Hi!. !!!. It's sunny (:
so are you :P
yup :D you're sunny 
just not like the name :P I guess more like.. the disposition? 
:D I'm pretty good! I feel like eating some ice cream though :P How are you?
(: sounds good. maybe? i'm not too sure.. how does being alright feel? :P
:P I don't know many things, so I'm not sure that this would be one of the things that I do know :P y'know?
yay :D it does ish. hmm.. maybe alright feels kind of like.. indifferentish?
aw, I wish there was a really tall building somewhere in Blacksburg. 
I really like that feeling you get when you look out the window of somewhere really high up :P
it's kind of like.. fun :D. and you can see everything
:P lol yeah! And all the flowers look like random blurs of color. and ants are non-existant :P
okay, I've found something good about America :P
Ben and Jerry's ice cream :P I hear they don't have nearly as many flavors over in the UK. It's kind of an ironic thing though, because America is also known for obesity :P
:D yum. what about? like, which flavor is the best? :P or who can go the longest without eating a Ben and Jerry Ice cream cone that's right in front of them? ooh, or how the number of people vs the time it takes to eat a vermonster is inversely proportional?
ohhhh. Neat :D what exactly do they do?
:D
oh yes, I vaguely recall reading the story on the back of my ice cream pint :P. It sounds awesome :D
That sounds like a cool class :D. I think I might to Statistics my senior year if it's anything like an amazing ice cream store :P. do*
:P now, if only some really awesome teacher taught it. like.. why doesn't Senor Opazo also teach math? :P It'd make it so much awesomer
:P yeah. And there aren't many songs you can sing about math :P
:D si! I've learned so much from the guy. hmm.. I think Mrs. Delpercio may beg to differ about the whole 'there not being a lot of songs about math' though :P. she seemed to sing a lot
:P it's really quite something. You might want to put that on your bucket list :P
So, got anythings planned on this awesome day? :D
nah :P besides possible attempts at driving
oh definitely :P or a future accident. hmm.. are you positive you're not planning on anything today?
oh well :P you better get planning, because the day is starting to get old :P. i'm predicting it'll die in about 8 hours :P
you don't think we're spending too much time together? :P and that doing something with your friends would be much more productive?
Well, I'm not bored of spending time with you :P but I wouldn't want to like deprive your friends of your awesomeness all the time :D
are you sure? like, what if they're missing you right this very moment? . I can imagine it now.. like.. Gap curled up in a corner because he misses you so much :P
doesn't mean he can't do that and miss you at the same time :P
oh. well. okay :P but still I don't think you'd ever get like boring to hang out with
I think I'd like to find out just how easy or difficult it is :P . but okay :D. It's awesomely sunny
:P well, I do... but... :P I feel like there could be better uses of your fime
:P spending time with your non-girlfriend?
:P like the day, which only has 8 hours to live?
where it's not sunny?. well, you're sunny enough to make the inside nice too :D. brb, I'm gonna go outside for about 2 seconds so I can dress appropriately :P. okay, It's wayyy too nice out there for you to be staying inside :P no matter how sunny you'd make it
aw no :P!. can I at least do something with you then? :P. sorry :P
yay :D :P I feel like that'd be sort of shellfish though. You're cool :D
It's alright, and really really? :P
:D yay
You're like.. A super duper amazing blob of coolness that can randomly morph into a bunch of cool things? :P . hmm :P We could always chill outside in the sun :D And you'd be super duper cool :D
The second is a fact :P. i think it even says so on wikipedia
:P I put a question mark just in case it sounded completely weird. But you are really super duper cool :D. :P are you sure? that's where I always go for information about celebrities real names :P. like that Peter Hernandez guy
:P lol yeah, I agree. But still.. hmm.. I'm pretty sure the Webster definition of Peter is like.. 'awesome' :P
:P no way. I'm pretty sure that the last time I looked, it said that :P. sorry
even though you are? :P. sorry
(: 
Nah, I'm positive :D are you sure that you still want to? :P
:D hmm.. how bout that place we normally meet at? :P and asap?
okay cool :D
oh, that's alright :D
alright cool :D. take your time (:
Well okay :P just don't trip or anything like that
it's alright :D
positive :D
alright, cool 8|. :P
:P I would make a bear smiley if Facebook had those :P
:P oh yeah, good point <(")
:D. would you be upset if I had a 7:00 curfew? 
I'm sorry
:D okay cool
yeah :D  It'd still be only till 7 though :P
are ya sure? :P 
okay cool :D should I start walking then?
:P aw, I feel like it'd only be like, 10 minutes. but okay, see ya :D
:D seeing you was really really fun! . You're so awesome (:. sorry :P. just wanted to tell you that :P 
:P nah
:P lol it's only true on Tuedays. tuesdays*
:P Tuesday is opposite day
yup. :D. Kind of embarrassing, but I learned that from Spongebob :P
:P oh, by telling them that they're super duper not amazing?. It's okay though, I don't often follow opposite day due to that confusion :P 
aw :( I wouldn't like Tuesdays then. It's the only day I could tell you that I really don't like your brown shoes :P
on Tuesdays?
except Tuesday? :P sorry, I'm making it confusing. I like you so so so so much :D. sorry :P
(: aw, that's a lot of 'so's :P
whoa :P lo. l. so there is :P. so is such an important word :P. Even though it's often waved off as a filler, I believe that it's a really important segway :P  like.. whenever there's a weird silence, you can just be like.. "Soooooo...." And that normally fixes stuff :P or that thing about gay babies that I may or may not have told you. segue*
(: That statement still only makes sense on Tuesdays :P  And just for clarification, I have nothing against gay babies :P or Abraham Lincoln (because for some reason, I group those two things together in my head)
(:  :P lol that's good to know. how did that political party thing go? or is it still in progress? :P
:D Awesome. . It sounds so lengthy just to be a homework assignment though ;p. :P*
I feel like a may drop out of that class within one day next year :P
lol thank you for the encouraging words :P
:P lol it's fine, I didn't take it too personally. It's weird, I actually have really liked history class this year besides all the work. Like, it's cool knowing stuff that has happened in the world that i'd never heard about before :P like, I didn't even know who Martin Luther was before
:P yeah.. I got him confused with Dr. King
yeah :P it turned out that they were not so similar
I know! :P . :P It's okay though, I think both of them are um... of the same religion at least? so maybe they're some of similar. . sort*. they might've been the best of friends for all we know :P
I think I gonna go eat dinner now, since the kitchen is starting to smell really nice. :P So(there's that word again :D), I'll talk to you later (:. Goodnight too, just in case :D. And have a really good night (:
(: aw. If I'm super amazing, then you're practically a saint or rockstar or something :P  . And I like you (honey) bunches (of oats) :D bye
Hey, It's okay :P. You're so cool :D!. sorry :P
nah :P but thanks?  :D how was that groupish thingy?. or um.. sending stuff?
oh yeah :P I did. I had a nice little chat with your mother.  
nah, she was nice :D and all I really said to her was: "Is there someone named Peter there?" :P lol I wasn't even positive that I had the right number
oh, it's fine really :D
:D how are you doing on this amazing day?
:D I'm doing awesomely and I second that :P
Nah, no ride either :P. Whoa!!! tomorrow!!! :D!!!. !! :D guess what day it is?
lol no :P but good guess
and good song :D. yes! :D but it also happens to be..... *drum roll*
free cone day! :D at ben and Jerry's!. oh, and that too :P
!! :D I know!. we could like stop by before the concert or something :P. I don't know if they mean that just the cone is free or if it comes with a scoop of ice cream too :P
:D yups! I'd assume it's just the cone part, because they say that you can get in line as many times as you want :P
yeah :D! I love waffle cones
aw, well :P we could still possible (though maybe not) do something :P. possibly
nah :P quite the opposite. hmm.. what about you? do you have like homework at all? :P
:P!! same :P
yeah! :D it's a crazy coincidence
! :D
:P it's alright :D! I'm right there with you on the yaying
definitely :P ahh, cookies are really good. Like, my sister made a bunch for the bake sale and she left a tray of them sitting out. Do you know how hard it is to not eat unattended cookies? :P
Well it. 's really really difficult :P I've failed twice already. That means that there are 2 less cookies sitting in that tray :P I'm hoping she won't notice
:P it's sooo hard! I think I might fail a third time :P. okay, I covered them up, so it's all good :P
:P!!! whoa, me too! I'm not sure if I can say whether that's normal or not though :P. hmm.. I wonder what they would say if someone brought their own cone :P. sorry for bringing up ice cream then :P. too
:P me too! lol Is it too hard to wait until Tuesday?
:D yum!. whoa, what makes you say Rita's is better? :P. huh?
:P ohh the ice cream part :P yeah, plain old vanilla bean is still my favorite :D that stuff is really good!. It's like.. yum (:. okay, I just failed again :P but only by 1/3 this time
:P wait.. 1/2 :P
aw (: even though I fail at resisting unattended cookies? :P
aw, thanks :P That means a lot
I'm positive that it means a lot :D I really like you. Aw, well you know what they say about tomorrow....
:P nooo... It's always a day away..
nah :P It's okay about.... forever :P
:D That band sounds so familiar!
... :P!. ohhh. 1901?
:P sorry. It's the lame mainstream one, right/. ?*. Also used in certain car commercials :P
I really like it :D
:P. (:. ahh, Is it weird that I really want some pumpkin pie flavored italian ice right about now? :P
:P yeah, I bet a lot of people just sit at home thinking.. "Wow, I really wish I had a pumpkin pie in the form of shaved ice right about now" :P
lol  :P Well it's not impossible to want things that you've never heard of before. hmm.. I think I'd want a crazy laser pen that shoots rainbows :D! does me thinking of it make it existent though? :P And If only I could, then I would :P
:P oh, lol it's totally fine, I wouldn't make you like, walk all the way here just so I could have a frozen pumpkin pie (And more importantly, see you (: ) sorry.. :P 
I believe you, even though it's completely crazy :P I do remember that Slurpee run, although that may have been more Andy's idea? :P
oh, aw.. Nah, I liked it a bunch :D Seeing you was awesome on its own
:P lol it's fine really, I think the idea might be just a tad crazy. I would approve if it was the other way around though :P
:P no way. It'd make a whole lot more sense
Because like, then you wouldn't have to walk really far and stuffs :P
Whoa, really? :P where'd you go?. but like.. this would be different because it's dark ish
!!! whoa! :P That's pretty crazy. I wish I had run into you or something. the dark is scary. Have we not talked about the weird lurking tigers and jabberwockies before? :P
:P I guess you've got a point there. Like not even a tiger could think you're uncool.
:D!. ah, I gotta go eat dinner I think
eating is most definitely fun :D but you too! :P lol I'm scared to go downstairs and pass by those unattended cookies again. :P Now I know how the cookie monster must feel.. om nom nom nom
:D!! ooh and pac man. pac man can never stop his mouth from like gobbling up stuff. he can never live a normal life :P. he'll end up eating all his furniture. and even his loved ones :P
:P oh yeah. it's okay though ,they're just little incomplete pizza with no toppings :P  maybe they're meant to be eaten :P And alrighty :D You're really really really amazing :D!!!!!!!!!!!!. like a cant-o-lantern :P
:P lol nah. hmm. I feel like a cant-o-lantern may not be the most practical thing because it'd be rolling around everywhere :P it'd certain look cool though. like you :P. but yeah, I'll see ya :D! or something. bye :D have a nice night if I don't stumble upon you more tonight
:D I hope yours is just as delightful. byebye
no way :P but that guy you see in that in your 2nd song in Mulan is :P  . bye, once again :P. oh whoops :P make that *in your* once. but yeah :P bye
yeah, sorry :P. bye
:D! whoa hi! :P lol I was just about to call you
:P already on it :P
Does this mean that you arrived home safely? (:
aw, what? :P This is you right?. And yes :P I think that was just about the scariest thing ever though :P 
:P next time, I'm asking my mom to give you a ride home
... :( the smiley does not make that statement good. unless by popped you mean something else :P
.. oh, well in that case, then I guess that's good? :P. congratulations :P. aw, thank you for the drawing, it's really nice :D And for the concert and everything. (you should be on your guard though ;P)
:D me too!!!!. I really really really liked it :D. yay. :P I need to get some cool spotlights like those
!! yes :P maybe Ben Folds will come. . like how moths are attracted to lights :P
:P Don't worry, i got you on speed-dial :P
lol no :P I was kidding. but only because if I did, your house would be getting a bunch of calls from nobody :P
:P you sure you could speak for the rest of your household?
Aw, thanks :P That's really something (:
Just did.. :D
ah, the way people draw cows is really cute, but their never really that cute in person :P . they're*
It might just be all the mud on their face though :P or like... the cud :P hmm.. I guess they're sort of cute from far away
:P exactly.. but you're cool close up too :P
:P Au contraire, I've been pretty close up to you for the past few hours, and there was nothing but coolness there :P
Well I'm not sure that you being sure makes it true :P
:P I'm not sure about that.  You're pretty awesome though :D!!! . ah, I think I should leave you to sleep now (And go do my homework) :P. or something like that :P
aw wait... :P. are you jut kidding about that/. ?*. because I'm pretty curious now
hmm, and what you were you saying when we left? like... something about pasta?
yeah :D
um-hmm
o.o. whoa really?
awww :P i feel bad about walking away now. I really thought you said something about pasta :P
:P lol that 2nd one must be the literal words
:P well it'd be more believeable if it didn't have the whole wanting a hug thing in there, but the walking backwards definitely fits :P. ah, you're so cool (:
:P nah, it's just like, not true. How can someone believe something that's not true? okay.. well, it's very possible, but still :P  . And nah :P. if I were cooler, then how come my smiley only looks like this? 8)
:P
aw (: well that would make me really really cool by like association or something
(: I think that might double the cool factor. or like, exponentiate it or something :P
Oh, i'm pretty sure :P. And it's fine, I'll probably fall asleep soon anyway :P
:P yeah. It's hard to fight sleep sometimes :P. It just kind of sneaks up on you. (like those nap attack things :P)
:P well okay, but it's fine really. :P You're being amazing (:. have a really good night
(: G'night Peter. sleep well and stay golden (:
Because rain makes a really nice lullaby? :D
yay (:. it is. pitter-patter :P
:P did it work? 
lol :P. Know what a Granny Smith apple is now? :P. sorry :P
before, this conversation? . :P now I really don't know what to believe
oh, it's fine :P
just kept weaving that tangled web of deception? :P
it's cool, I had trouble believing that you'd never heard of it before anyway :P
:P i'll try not to. Ah, the words on my tongue right now are most likely not true but i keep wanting to say them anyway
:P it's fine, it's not at all your fault. nice question mark by the way :P. I'm a little confused too?
ohh :P well, it's nothing you'd be able to prevent really
:P well mine sort of depends on what you say
ish :P
oh, well, what were you going to say before I started typing? :P
:P oh. Well i was just going to say that if the feeling stays then I'd like, get the words out. I dunno. Sorry :P It's past late now
I wish I did :P
aw okay... I don't even know why I feel like this. sorry :P . anywho, g'night then and stuffs
:P I guess you're right. see you tomorrow :D
okay (: I'm yours..
What I saw was pretty fantastic too :P And I'm sure the rest were just as amazing :D (even that relay) . Aw, I'm sorry I couldn't stop by or anything, I felt kind of weird going to your house :P Your dad has a pretty awesome car though.
oh Hi :P
oh nah, it's fine :D
Awesome :D how'd you do? :P And no, I was really considering going over though. . :D so I figured out the song. and it's a beatles song.. And I was just about to listen to it.. when all of a sudden.. I hit play, and no sound came out :P. So, looks like I won't be able to hear it for a while
I know :(
It's okay though, I'll get to the bottom of it so I can listen to it :P (*pulls out magnifying glass and Holmes trench)
Whoa!!! That's really good :D You're like... fast. like.. Homer Simpson being chased by a giant bear fast :P   And when would you ever be able to ruin my night? :P. :P definitely, I'm not sure if I'm tech savvy (Jack Sparrow :P) to do it though. enough to do it *
maybe :P. Ah, I think I actually have to go.. partly because I'm gonna restart my computer, and partly to go eat dinner :P Hopefully I'll be able to see you more tomorrow at school than today though, that assembly ate up my 10 minute break . As great as it was seeing Jared, talking to you would have been equally, if not more, awesome :P
Aw :/ No way, I'm sure you'd only make it better. :D Seeing you is always really nice and completely non destructive of the wellbeing of my day :P. Thanks :D I liked that jog we went on :P lol even if it had a little too much hoytness in it.  . I hope your day has been just as nice (: . G'night you :D
I dream a lot of bit :P even if that does sound more like a familiar song than a random statement. but yeah :D bye
You really believe that? :P You're worth every second and more, even if that sounds completely cliche.
ooh, really? :D! how does it go?
:P Didn't you read that message? It's not a waste. Grape soda is really good sometimes :D 
Whoa.. I think I know what you mean.
Well that first line felt really really similar to how I felt... like.. did I ever tell you about like.. my heart being silly and my head trying to be smart about stuff, but like, I don't know which one I should follow?
I still don't know which I should follow. :( I like hearts, but heads seem so reasonable. What did your head think compared to your heat?. heart*
nice song by the way too :D
:P kinda and sorta sounds pretty familiar
oh, aw. Well I think your head is wrong too :P but all this talk of hearts and heads makes me think of that paramore song
oh yeah :P sorry for not specifying.. it's like.. "That's what you get"
It's weird though, I always though that that song was about listening to your heart and like.. "letting your heart win".. but I'm kind of realizing that it says the opposite :P like, it's saying that things go wrong when you only listen to your heart
:P ooh, as in.. heart over head? :P
oh yeah :P psh, he doesn't specify whether it went well or not though. . maybe it'll always be the universal struggle of heart vs. head
ah, I might still have to go :P. just a teensy bit
it's really fine :D that like..?. I mean, whatever it is, I'm almost certain it's fine, I'm just curious though.. because you haven't done anything wrong :P
oh :P well.. um. Would it be rude not to accept that apology?. like.. there's nothing to apologize for
:P Wait.. which weird feelings are you talking about?. And it's alright, the weekend is soon, and I can catch up on sleep then :P
okay, that's what I thought you meant.. there's really no need to be sorry about that though :D
:P Ahh, I don't know what to listen to. But I personally really like having you as at least a friend :D
:P i said 'at least'
It's okay :D
It's no problem, okay? I'd leave if it was really that urgent. :P And it's not your fault at all, like... I'm the one who's staying.. but I should probably go, so I'll see you later or somethin' :D
See you tomorrow? . :P. but yeah :D bye!
:P oh, just thinking of 3 word combinations
ah, that's a bunch of white space :P. Would it be bad if I were to scroll up?
oh okay :P
it's fine :D. okay, I'm gonna do it :P. i think.. whoa, that is just a whole lot of white space... :P. ohhh okay.. Well I like you too :D. even if that's not exactly it :P
you're not :P. but okay, thanks, you too :D
as are you :P. lol sorry kidding
:D pride yourself in.. hmm..not being dumb? :P
ohh :P lol. Well be proud, because it's totally working for you :P
aw, I'm sorry, really. just kidding, of course.. Even if you 'not a man' :P. sorry again
:P!! I know I know, I'm sorry
aw.. :P it's okay though, eating doughnuts with running just sounds confusing
you shouldn't be, trust me :D. Sweet dreams, okay? :D
teehee :P
still have gauze in your mouth because it won't stop bleeding? :P
:P deja vu. "I've seen this all before" :P. lol like my Zack and Cody reference?. it was a first hand experience
it's kinda bad, I think I was replacing mine every 10 minutes at first :P 
yours was every 5? :P. oh okay :P. lol I'm patient
okay :P take your time
yay :D. lol :P . did you enjoy the teeth pulling process?
:P !! lol the needles feel so funny. and it's hard to talk too :P "rugh ablae ohkea" :P. That would roughly translate too "My mouth feels funny."
yups :D!. I'm not sure about my feelings toward that.. I'm mostly happy because that gives me free time and whatnot :P
So, any details on the whole teeth pulling thing?
:P a lighter what?  lol :P Was he like, really tugging?
:P ohhh! nice! that's really cool. lol I was about to be like.. hm... I don't think cauterizing works on gums..
ish? Yeah, I read it ish :P. smart how you made it look like the thingy I gave you :P
:P oh, no, you were totally right. I tried to make it as un-pink as possible, but i guess it was still visible. I was afraid the paper would burn before the stuff turned blue :P
:P I guess the pink was helpful in that way. 
:P!! lol it sounds like such a cool feeling. . aw :D it's a heart. I remember it being really weird to touch your face :P. because your face can't feel it..
yeah!! exactly :P it's like.. your face is gone.
omg! :D!!!. Thank you Google, for choosing the best day possible to allow me to watch a video without worrying that I won't be able to hear what's going on because of my busted speakers :P
it was probably just some ragtime music, but I still caught the storyline :D
oh yeah, I was wondering about that :P I would totally be available for an indoor event though(because it might get dark soon :( )  . hmm.. have you eaten anything yet?
:P oh yeah. blood and cookies don't taste good together. my mom let me have some of her 'adkins' protein shakes when my mouth was all bereft :P . i think I was on those for about 3 days. oooh :D and i remember I crushed up my frosted mini wheats and poured milk over it, then let it get soggy. :P It was like eating all the little cereal crumbs that are normally at the bottom of the box.
okay :P And yeah, it was really something. I probably would've continued eating it that way even after I was better if it didn't take so long to crush up :P
:P lol I'm not sure if you'd enjoy it. And I should include some fine print saying that it might not work as well for some cereals :P. like, crushed up dehydrated marshmallows may not be the best :P
yay :D. I like you :D
:D. i think
yes :P I think, therefore, I am
:P I'm confused too.. I never exactly understood that phrase.. sounds better in latin.. And I think that breakfast food guy said it possibly :P. either him or the 'silent s' guy
oh um.. Bacon and Descartes? 
oh definitely :P . it's my favorite commercial, featuring that scottish guy with the spikey hair :P. I watch it everyday at around 7:30
yeah :P
(: It's okay. Though it's pretty profound :P. no wait, wrong word... I meant.. hmm.. abstruse? 
:P lol psh, that was definitely not average
Well I wouldn't say the same :D. I'm gonna go eat a doughnut
aw, sorry :P don't mean to like.. . rub it in that my teeth still work :P
I mean, I'm sure they have liquid doughnuts or something. aw, don't hurt yourself. or get dry sockets. I hear that saltwater prevents dryness :P
:P lol crazy that you're still able to, or is it crazy imagining ice cream going in your mouth?. your 'bleeding' mouth :P
:P That can be arranged.. maybe :P. it's like, always been the sunny side up to getting your tonsils taken out :P. And now I guess it could be applied to teeth too
wait, did you ever get the thingy I was saying about Google? :P. yay :D! you should celebrate by eating some super soft food
totally :P  Oh, and like, my speakers haven't been working. And so, I went to google today, only to find (you'll see :D) and it made me happy that I was still able to watch that without being handicapped with the whole 'no sound thing'. by the whole*
yes :D!. silent movie for my silent computer. on the day of silence? :P
yup :D! whoaaaaaa. epiphany!. Do you think that the "Day of Silence" people overlapped the two events on purpose?. like.. charlie chaplins birthday? :P
he was a pretty silent guy. poihaps :D
oh yeah :P I was just about to comment how it's down there all alone. :P It's cool though. yeah, I'll ttyl maybe :D good luck with your mouth. I want details on how/ what you eat later :P not in a creepy way, but just because it seems interesting
Well, I'll ask my mom :D maybe I could even provide you with a protein shake if you were to come over :P (sorry, my freezer is ice-cream-less) or we could do something else if ya had anything in mind. but yeah, I'll talk to you later :D. bye. for now
:D okay. happy um.. gauze-replacing and salt-water gurgling :P
:P lol :D!! or HEOD if you include the of.. sounds like some weird kung-fu yell. HeeeeOd. !
:P. :P lol psh, acronym makers only include it if it adds to the awesomeness of the acronym
maybe :P I liked yours too, because it's like a real word as well, so you could like.. confuse people with it.. just like.. say 'HED" when people tell you they're going to Carol Lees :P and then just watch the confusion/ weird looks
yeah, see ya :D I'll get back to you shortly if I'm able to do something
once again, good luck :P. hmm... HGRASWG. just doesn't have the same ring to it... sounds kind of like.. a caveman grunting at you :P
or like, what that weird man who mumbles stuff under his breath at the grocery store would say
yeah :P Aw, no offense to him though. All this med term mental health stuff is just giving me a whole new perspective on everything.
:P oh yeah, I'm excited. I might even end up with some portable Rochesljrlea inkblot test cards :P
yups :D Watchman dude
:P I'm bad with German ish names because of the non-phonetic pronunciations. hmm.
is it like.. Roar-shack? :P
or hmm... Roar-shaaaak?. :P lol
sounds kind of like jaques. :D yeah, doughnut. peace.
:D
:D hi again!. ah, you could probably guess already, but I don't think I'll be able to see you today :P. Good thing i did earlier today :D. lol Harry potter day.. That was a nice little costume and Redskins scarf :P
aw, doing something cool? :D
oh :D! we could!. lol, I don't plan that quickly, Peter! :P I like, just had the meet plan, and I only found out that was cancelled about 4 hours ago.
si :D tomorrow seems like a pretty good prospect
Aw :( That sounds so unsymmetrical and uncomfortable :P
:P it's okay, I completely understand. but now you know how like.. vampires must feel. or full-time boxers
:P or do both. At the same time :D!. That could be a pretty lethal combination because the sparkling could distract your opponent :P
:P psh, way to take a conversation about sparkling boxers and make it about girls not liking you. but it was a nice joke :P
:P lol 'human' probably doesn't even have to be on the list because it's so self explanatory :P for um.. most people at least.? . :P you think?. i think too
Whoa, the wind is like, being crazy outside. it sounds like.. it could be... A tornado! O.O!. Sorry, I won't even joke about such things
I know! o.o I never thought it could happen before, because of the mountains, but apparently this strand of tornadoes has gotten some rock climbing lessons or hiking boots or something of the sort :P
Are you sure about that? :P that sounds even more suspicious.. or tornado like.. I'm a little scared.
I might've been being paranoid, but I could've sworn I heard some screams from outside o.o
.... please don't joke.. it's like.. a really really scary sound o.o. it's like, a whole bunch of wooshing...and wind chimes... :(
I'm concerned. Yes!. but I haven't heard any tornado warnings, so I'm not too worrried.. yet :P
oh, no.. here come the sirens o.o. Thanks for the encouraging words though :P. wait, that may just be because of my proximity to the fire department, but still :P
Whoa! :P must be cause we live quite close :P . aw, you say that like you're good friends with me or something :P
maybe :P
best friends?. frieds? "{. :P*
that? . or um.. bf? :P. best friends/good friends? :P. sorry
yeah :P
it's okay, it hits pretty close to the truth :P
:P possibly
aw, (: it's not the least bit lame, although it might be a really bad decision
:P may I ask how so?
aw... (: . I like being with you quite a lot too. :/ aw, Have I ever told you that I feel kind of bad when you say stuff like that though? 
Well, because I know you deserve a whole lot more than me.. I'm sorry, I know it sounds silly and possibly cliche, but it's pretty true.
:P That can't possibly be true. But thanks for making me feel um.. adequate :P
not exactly.. like.. there's something special about you, i'm pretty positive. I'm still figuring it out though :D
Nah :P can't be it.. there's something more special even than that (which isn't hard). :P
You can't say there's nothing special about you when there is :D!!. beside me :P. besides*
not that I would count anyway
:P pshh, well your say is silly. sorry :P just in that though
Well I think you're really something special :D. ah, I'm gonna have to denounce my being perfect though :P me and perfect just don't go together. You might come close though :D
..like ranch dressing and brownies? :P. sorry :P wait.. what context is it in exactly?
ohhh :P I do see. sorry, my thoughts are all jumbles. like kev ;p. :P*
Jumba :P sorry
It's alright :P I wasn't sure how specific to be
:P nah, it's fine. Maybe your thoughts were jumba-ed too :P
aw, really? Well there's no use in both of us feeling bad :P or in anyone feeling bad actually, You shouldn't though.. I think it's just me. Or something like that :P but still, it doesn't add up (I really do need a better non-math related term for that) :P
Me either :P it may be an impossible task.
:J aw. :P well thanks then? If anyone can do the impossible.. it's you :P
:P maybe. for you.. somehow
:P me either
sorry :P
:/. :'(
you said heartbroken.
and broken hearts are sad stuff :(. sorry :P
easy stuff is normally nice, especially in track and similar things, but why would it make you heartbroken? :/
aww :/ i just.. i don't know..  I guess I have trouble grasping that it wouldn't be easy just to like, not be with me.  But I still imagine that you'd be so much better with someone better (for lack of better adjectives :P) And I know that you being with me assures that I can make myself the bestest for you, but I guess you could say that some things are just impossibly hard to change :/
Still.. some things I just feel... :/ very less than adequate at..
yeah :/
Sorry, I dunno . :P
nah, it's fine, I liked it :D hmm.. what is everything you could think? :P sorry. ooh, so the wind died down a little
:P oh nos! maybe the tornado is migrating :P
You mean a lot to me too (:. :/ 
sorry, I'm still stuck on that whole, thinking you should like someone better idea :P. i'm sorry..
awww.. well you're definitely definitely not a disappointment. you're a really really really good guy (:
:P oh no!! but what if you do find out what happens when you let your heart win?. or um.. "what you get"
And you deserve more of the light that I'm getting than I do :P
aw (: I like your compliments.. just.. I don't know.. the way I see me, with you.. like.. I don't know.. maybe this is one of those things I should be saying in person :P
:P yay
:P lol ohkayy.. but only because you used the um.. please word :P . And okay :D
I'm not sure if talking will make things worse though :/. hmm.. what are you saying? :P
:/ not quite. sorry :P I'm being sort of negative. But I really really do feel that way... I'm sorry, again
:/ aw, these recent past few days?
aw, :/ but that's terrible.. because you're more than good enough. And you're fun to be with :D
Maybe you're right.. maybe :/ . Love is silly :/
I know... I don't think that'll help me understand it any better though :P. it might..
Love is so weird..maybe it's not meant to be understood though :P
exactly :D!
yeah.. I know what you mean.. That's a nice definition (:
aw, no.. I agree with you almost 100% on that, so you'd have at least 2 people to vouch for it's accuracy :P
Much obliged :P
:P Heart not head?
aw (:. That sounds cute
(: Thanks.. It cheered me up a little :J
nah, more of nothing in particular getting me down :P. well.. sort of nothing in particular
:D!! . I'll go um.. read it :P
:P . aww Taylor Swift!!
:P lol it's funny, and cute at the same time. and maybe sad?. I think I've heard Taylor's version before, it's really familiar
:D well that's because he's already heard Taylor Swift's one, so he's not doubting anything? maybe? :P
Magic? no :P. ohh, I doubt my own doubt though :P. lol :P did you already hear the thing about how she capitalized out Adam's name in the lyric book?
aw, well I wouldn't doubt that you'd be able to write a really cute song :D  it'd be silly to waste it on me though :P
but yeah :D!! She like.. capitalized random letters in the lyrics..
and they spelled Adam somehow :P it sounds like a cute little relationshipe. ship*. aw.. really? :/
it's not.. just.. indirectly bad :P
noo :P not that either. your lyrics are awesome.
just me being a debbie downer again :P. lol I wonder how that phrase got popular again
Must be :D! and then she realized she was being such a downer, and that it would make such a great phrase. . Thanks :J And I think you have a few masterpieces already, but I'd believe in you :D!
:P lol! psh, who says you can't be a Debbie?
:P lol 
mustache guy
:D yeah! it's so weird. hehe my mustache must ache. ooh, I'd be a mistake getting a mustache case they must ache? :P. is this copy writed somewhere? :P. it. 'd*
mind if I use it for a certain project? :P
about um.. mustaches? :P
oh thanks :P. lol. whoa.. wind.. scary.. again. :P
:D whoa! that's just what I was thinking!
lol the wind or the (approximate) rhyme?
:D it's scary when it like.. pushes on the side of the house... it's like.. the not so friendly BFG
:P jump in a mosh pit where no one will catch you?
nah, just hm.. crowd surf on the floor?. :P
nah
you'd be wearing protective gear of course
:P nonsense.. that's ludacris.
:P really, you got stung by a bee? or this this happen ages ago and it turns out that the bee is still in there, making honey?. or did this*
whoa. that's really really scary O.o it wasn't near my house, was it? :P
...
....!
...!?!. :P I don't know.. i'm waiting for you to say that you're kidding... please?
I don't know.. like.
but like.. did you not notice till later or something?
awww :(. Sorry for freaking the bee out. it stung the wrong person
:P the right person would be anyone but you
but more specifically, me
I've never been stung by a bee before..
yeah.. once?
whoa :P a bee that lives the ground?. that's kind of freaky
I thought I was safe down there
whoa.. wait.. did you really really get stung? like.. how does that happen?
really?. I dunno. I've never seen anyone else get stung before either.. it seems like a 1 in a million chance or something :P. even though I know it's not
o.o. bad experiences? . lol :P was he okay?
That still sounds really scary.. I'm sorry for like.. giving you a bee sting indirectly.
:(
... :P for giving you a weird swollen bump?. that itches?. :P
:( aw, well you're welcome.. but I'm still sorry, mostly because I probably got it all angry and stuff by running away :P
:P I have little experience in the subject.. I know bees are bad at chasing people though. . actually.. maybe not :P. cartoons always say otherwise
when you ran? ;p sorry. :P*. whoa.. That's a little creepy.
o.o did you find like.. the bee on your back?
o.o . that's kind of really disturbing :P
that bee might have liked you a little too much to let go :P
:P no other clingy insects at least? Maybe it just got stuck.  wow, I remember once, sort of recently, I was home alone and I thought I saw a bee in my house, so I got kind of freaked out and just sat outside until my mom got home :P . I'm pretty wimpy with stuff like that :P
o.o!!!! yes.. :P lol what about me?
:P lol . only after a pretty long time and after I've realized that I should probably let go before I just like completely melt or something :P . :P like uncoated m & ms . or the wicked witch of the west
:P I don't know.
:P!! lol well maybe I could. and maybe it'd be sublime
oh, i dunno, it sounded mostly fine to me :P. hugging you is kind of undescribable 
! :D lol I was thinking of that song once I said the word 'melt'. and chocolate, of course. and of*. :P lol I think I know, maybe. but what do I know?
:P what have I known? that I'm in love with you or something? because that can't be it :P . it's like.. outrageous orange.                         or something
:P 
oh :P how does it actually go?
it sounds familiarish :P
Oh. :P maybe the familiarity is just in my head. that's a very cool band name though :D
Me too :P Unfortunately, I don't know what I know either
:P whoa, so that quote is actually quite applicable? maybe? :P Does it tell me how to find out what I know but don't know?
:P so that's what it'll feel like?. lol I'm not sure.. maybe I'll be at some airport and suddenly realize something
love is still silly :P
I'm not really sure :P I mean, that must've been a love song you were quoting from, right?
.. :P
:P really now?. that's kind of cool.
and original maybe :P
:P oh, I sort of maybe did fall asleep just a tad. I hope your day is going nicely and such :D
That's okay :P I think i just have bad timing
Nah, that happens to everybody once in awhile :P are you doing anything special tonight? I hear there are gonna be some candles in cups around 7:30
:P psh, I'm not Demitri Martin, no important things going on here. 
:D Hi there
I'm pretty alright I think :D how are you doing?
:D That sounds alright
ooh, :D!! how has eating been going? :P
:D Whoa, that's really good! like, how? :P
:P wait, really? 
That's crazy.. like... hmm. :P. ohhh :P . just kidding, still don't understand :P
like, how does the food not get stuck in the holes? :P lol
That must be it :P Just think, when you're old and loosing teeth, You'll still be able to eat all your favorite foods without a problem :P
:P! Where are the gaps in your mouth?
all 4? :D!
oh. :P That's where mine got pulled too! :D!! maybe it's like, the most useless tooth or something. 
:P aw, well, did you take them home with you? :P
That's probably for the best. Teeth look really creepy when they're not in your mouth.. :P
I mean, they don't look exactly like those dancing teeth in that one Fairly Oddparents episode. :P
! :D lol that must be what dentists do with all the unclaimed teeth they have.. :P hmm. I wonder where those all go anyway
:P aw. Part of you will forever be in some landfill.
That must be what that one band thought when they named themselves that :P . You're not though :D. Whoa, so, I just discovered the meaning behind that one Train song :P. well, part of it anyway
Hey, Soul Sister :P. I found out that there's a band called 'Mr. Mister" And I feel like that might be who is being referred to in the chorus :P
:D! yeah! . perhaps. :P lol "ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio?" I guess it would make sense if it was a band rather than a random rhyming filler
oh, you're welcome :P I hope it was just life-changing for you.
Aw, well there could be. I guess it is kind of late now though :( I dunno, how late is eight? :P. sorry, I rounded up to rhyme
:P I would most definitely want to. You're like, amazing and fun to be with :D
:P oh yeah, maybe the moon will provide lots of light :D. or something.
:D aw, I do want to. Would it be bad to think that there'd be more time tomorrow though? I mean, I guess that's what I thought last night too though, so I'm not sure. :/ hmm, didja have anything in particular in mind? :D
:D that sounds nice. especially with you :P
:D I'm glad you live moderately nearby :P
maybe? :P
possibly :P . whoa.. So I was thinking earlier. ... about like... the phrase "You are not" 
because like, it can be contracted like.. "You're not" or "You aren't".. but then, if you do a double contraction (Whoa really? I like those :D ) then it just sounds silly :P 
:D aw, I think I might have to go look at it. whoa! :D!!! I've never ever ever seen Ace Ventura before.. I still say you look like an Ace though :P
I'm not sure :P it just seems to fit you. I might not think the same after watching this movie though :P Have you ever seen it?
is it.. good? :P
:P lol that's definitely not what I meant. when I brought it up :P
I'm just not sure what we would do/ where :P
:D! aw, I'd like walking with you.. Where should we meet up? :P
:P it just needs to be ratified by my mom is all. and she has full veto power o.o. :P 
I think the same :P
:P I might have to find out
wait :P before I do, just because I know she might ask, Where exactly would we walk?
ooh, good idea :P she might approve
sorry :P asking is difficult
yeah :/ no luck. She said yes to tomorrow though
aw :( hmm.... me either :P. :D I <3 you. :P. that's a heart.
:D yay
:P lol yes!
!!!! :P That's kind of cool
!! :D!! I want to hear it :P. if I can get my laptop audio to work. :P did you say once, that you were always on skype?
:P oh okay
ohh :P lol that's funny. hold on, I'm gonna try restarting my computer again :P. okay, I tried :P but my computer still appears to be in a catatonic state. :P
me either :P I've dropped it before though, a few times. And it makes weird noises when I shake it :P 
:P not exactly. I don't really know what's wrong either. Sorry, I gotta restart again :P I might be gone for awhile.. Wish me luck :P
ttfn :P. :P I think my computer is officially mute. It's not yet Helen Keller status though, because the microphone and webcam still work :P  (Sorry, Helen) . If it were 11:11 or if I had a birthday cake or a wishing well lying around in my room, I would wish to see you tomorrow (or today?).  I mean, I could still wish on this um.. ooh! :D WishBear Care bear action figure thing. Maybe he'll help it come true :P. But yeah, g'night and have good dreams and don't get eaten by crazy sneakers :P. It's quite sunny looking outside (:
Oh i know, i don't even know how that happens :P
Whoa, That's pretty crazy :P were they from me?
:P Well maybe it's just some hollywood magic or witchcraft or something crazy like that. And thanks :P I think I believe in the power of WishBear :P. Oh, 'Ello. Any chance you're somewhere by your computer? :P
:P Well, who knows.. you may have like.. a wireless keyboard or something like that :P
:D si si. My computer says I've seen it before :P. I think I have.. yet, it doesn't look familiar :P
or maybe it's my first time :P
Oh, I think I most definitely do :D. if it's possible
Is it even cooler if I do? :. :D*
Yay :D. because I do :D
hmm.. Have I ever shown you this one song?  It goes something like.. "I've got these raging insecurities, want nothing more for you to see in me something you never really found me for. I hoped to always keep you wanting more. You dance around my head throughout the day,  A want, a wish, a will to have my way. So, walk with me into the setting sun. You look at me like no one ever does. And when I fumble over words, you smile. You'll kiss my cheek and say "I like your style."  Read me words from your life story,  I will tell them over and again. I'll tell the world just how you got that perfect smile I can't withstand.  Let me kiss you index finger, I'll point out how you've made me crazy. I know I'd do it all the same way; I'd do it all the same." ? :P. I known the song for awhile, but it's kind of starting to remind me of you somehow :P 
I really like the lyrics :P Especially that line about pointing :P
lol I guess that'd depend what crazy means. :P hmm.. so what do you wanna do? :D
:D I'm not too sure, I think you summed it up nicely :P We could sit around outside or walk or something, and possibly play mortal kombat :P lol
so do you :D
more than that cool :D!. aw, I'm afraid I'm only free till 7:30ish though
:D definitely!
:P like.. right now?
:P maybe. well, maybe 4:30, I could like, meet you at the dentist place, and we could go play in the park or something? :P 
:P oh, the one near my street I'm thinking?
:D!! lol nice math humor. see ya :D
:P lol that's what I was thinking too
:D okay cool, I'll start heading over or something :P
psst, Good night :D If you happen to be there :P
(: You're just.. like.... well, it's like everything that is good in the world was shoved into like one very awesome person who is you :P (And yes, that includes rainbows and imitation crab) :D
:P aw, did that rhyme on porpoise/. ?*
it sounded very nice either way :D
you think? :P were you in one of those "writing train of unconsiousness" thingys? :P
ooohh, so like, the rest is just waiting up in your head? :D. :P
:P wonderstruck. oh yeah, it's fine.. I'm sure it's 2am somewhere :P (or 5 o'clock, depending on how much of a fan you are of country music)
:P it's fine. Those songwriters really do always know what to say
Me too (: I think you get it across quite nicely though. 
Aw, no I really liked that :D lol it'd be so ironic if that was quoted from another song though :P
:P Well I thought it was amazing. And they have songs about just about everything out there.. Probably even about flying turtles with airbags. So, I wouldn't judge your creativity by that :P
Whoa. hmm, must be some hidden message or something :P
:P maybe it's just in case people can't tell that it's about a first kiss. or hmm.. That is sort of interesting. or maybe it's to mirror the "When we first met" title, if that was about this girl named Chelsea too
Or maybe.. . it didn't fit the meter :P . sorry :P . I think I might get to sleep right about now, or maybe research the Spanish Civil War or something :P
That sounds like just as much fun :P. :D G'night to you too. lol wait, do you happen to like that imitation crab stuff too? :P
:P how do you explain rainbows then? . rainbows are always good.. (I think)
:D You=awesome. And I'm not sure if you'd like imitation crab at all :P It tastes kind of like.. fruit loops mixed with fish. ish.. Anywho, G'night :D. My wish came true :D
:D aw, what was yours?
aw :P lol psh, that's okay, no one has to know about that second part :P It was just out of the goodness of your heart
It was amazing :D . (: Sorry for all the hugging though :P
I'll try to cut down a little next time and respect your restraining order more, if possible :P. :P lol were you honestly?
Well, you say that now, but like, maybe you'll regret it like, in 5 minutes or so. :P 
oh, i'm not sure, it was a completely random time :P 
I hope not, but anything is possible :P. :D I think I'll get to see you tomorrow.. I'm excited
Well, what about you, Mr. Amazing? :P You're still up there with the rainbows. :P over the rainbow
:P I could visit every now and then, but I don't think I know the combination :P And I lost my master key
Well that just doesn't make sense, but thanks for your reassuring certainty on that. :P Anywho, see ya tomorrow boyfriend :P. (:
:P!! lol . That'd be especially nice :P
(: I'm glad you think so. :D You're pretty amazing yourself. (as a boyfriend, not girlfriend :P) I hope your dreams are sweet too :D! byebye
(: . Peace out :P. Home sizzle
:D
:D I liked your rhyme. :P I hadn't even noticed at first 
:P Well it'd be weird if you spoke in rhymes, but a coincidental or cool one every now and then is nice :D!. lol Rhyming in moderation
nooo, never give up on your dreams :P. That's what I've learned in life.. oh, and hope is never dead :D
:P noo, she's immortal, really.. How are you? :D
.... was that a positive 'yeah..."? :P
aw, that looks like a question mark :P
:P I think those signify uncertainty.. Are you like, happy? :D
.... :P. yes, but I wish I knew like, what's troubling you. Can I guess? :D will you give me a hint? Should I already know? :P
aw :( inadequacy of.. what exactly? 
Aw :( Well, like.. you shouldn't feel like that, because you're like, more than good enough. for anyone and everyone :D
yes... . you most definitely could :D. aw, is that how you were feeling earlier today? :/
aw possibly? :( like, did anything in particular cause it? . o.o
It's okay, they're probably worse. It's just kind of um.. unsettling when anyone uses the phrase "killed myself". aw, wait.. continue. if you want. I didn't mean to like, interrupt
oh. okay. I'm still really curious what caused it though... you shouldn't be feeling unadequate at all or anything
aw, I don't see why.. You're pretty like, amazing. And I'd say amazing qualifies as more than adquate
But like, it rained while it was sunny today, and that was pretty amazing :D And you found a bunch of luckiness in the form of clovers :P ooh, and there isn't long until that break we have :D But then again, maybe it's Mondayness getting in the way of all this awesomeness? I'm sorry.. :/ I wish I knew why you're bummed, or how I could make it better or cheer you up somehow :/
:P lol . aw, so was that all that's troubling you? :D
:P lol nooo.. the inadequacy, I meant. Even though you're most definitely not inadequate :D 
But, it's true :D. And I wish you'd believe the trueness too :P
:D Well I think I've made enough wishes for now--it was time to pass it on :D Not that you're the 'less fortunate' or anything :P 
You seem like you're pretty perfect already :D
:D well, I agree on both
:P lol did I really help all that much? Maybe I should point out how amazing you already are more often :P
(: I can't think of anything that sets me apart from any other complimenter :P. well, just one thing, but I'm not sure that counts :P
:P I was gonna say that I'm special because I'm yours (: Hopefully that counts? :D
yay :P And thanks.. You're super duper duper duper special ;P. :P*
:P lol nah, that might make you un-special :P  It's because you're like, a good person :D And you're good at reading people and stuff. hmm. Did you really not know who CCR was? :P
:P oh okay, that makes sense. aw, why the :/ face? 
oh :P Well, I'd have to disagree on that, but feel free to go on believing it :P. (:
(: Aw, it's okay, cheese is nice :P I don't understand how you believe that though :P 
:P Maybe you're just nightmare-ing. I like you. sorry :P
:P lol a 'beautiful nightmare'?
(: Oh, sure :P Nah, it's because of you :D But aw, I gotta go
(: I hope you have some awesome dreams too :D (If this isn't one :P) I think you're more than adequate :P And you're still way out of my league. (:  Bye :D 
You're so awesome though. :D So it must be the not other way around :P :D I'll see you tomorrow :D!! See ya. oh whoops :P. Sorry for the repetitiveness of that last part
:P lol. That's a nice way to look at it. Bye Lucky :D
nah, you make your own luck pretty nicely (:
If only I could... :P But yeah, bye :D Waffles are way better than T-Shirts. Maybe. Well.. A never-ending waffle would be. G'night :D And nice talking to you
:P I like ice cream
oh, it's cool :D . :P! How was it?
yum :D I never keep trap of what type of drink is which, but is that the one that's like.. an italian ice milkshake type thing? :P
Awesome :P lol sounds like the perfect combination.. like, chocolatey sweet fishyness? :P
:D lol as long as it has sugar, I'm in
did you like, like it? :D
:D yum. Aw, me too :D! It'd be so cool. It's due tomorrow though, so I'm not sure if we could take a raincheck :P
yeah.. :P wow. so. hmm.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLvyUFYWGk. it's rather disturbing :P but I do like We the kings... hmm
:P lol the video gives the song like, a whole new sound.
oh my goodness :D!!!!!!!!!!!!
oh, just something exciting :P. lol it's probably kind of lame to be excited about :P
oh :P it's just some drawings of a very confused dog :P but they make me happy (:
:P lol here is a small sample..  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xwUqfCwZVeE/Ta4DbJNTzrI/AAAAAAAAE6U/up0I7kkUj9Y/s1600/dogsagain65.png
lol yeah :P lol :P it's funny, because everyone knows that trees and bs do not equal mailboxes
exactly :D!!. or one of those bear shaped jars of honey :P
aw :( alone? . and yes :P
:( aw, silly dentist appointment... And it's okay, really :D I can put it off for awhile longer :P. hmm.. what kinds of things do you put on bread? :P . i guess i mean like.. out of the ordinary things :P
lol :P crackers with bread? :D! that's like eating pasta with bread :P ooh, and cards?
:P oh, that must be delicious. It must make your tummy burn afterwards :P. well.. maybe as long as you don't swallow any bombs or matchsticks scratchpads it'd be fine :P
oh, no :P but it could be. lol :P i was just eating my weird bread and wondering what other people do
ohh :P lol. I see.. I dunno.. is like.. bread with cream cheese and honey on it normal? :P I just instinctively did it today, and I was wondering why, but then I remembered that I had done it once before when I ran out of that Honey Nut Cream Cheese and was trying to make some of my own :P
yeah :P I guess it's not as weird as matchsticks. It's really really good though :D so I can understand why people would try it
yum :D bread goes good with like, everything
I haven't had honey smacks since about 2nd grade :P
:D yeah! you just need something to stick it on
:P psh, but glue doesn't taste as good as honey and granola bars and honey smacks
:P oh yeah, better to be in bad taste right?
:P lol um.. yeah.. that um.. um... :P sure.
I can say for sure that no one in the Donner family was much of a stud :P . um. muffin
Donner party*
oh, it's cool :P . Willy Wonka knew what he was talking about though. lol :D you know what Honey Smacks reminds me of?
"But my tricks ain't for kids, if you dig'em, you'll get smacked :P
:P lol this is where my love for rap comes from.. maybe.. :P 
ah, well I best be off me matey. :P
arright me hearty :P. tee hee :P sorry. Have ye some fun scallywagging :P
:P I'll try. Is your line open if my brain goes in slow motion? 
oh, um. facebooking it up or the telephone if you're home. :P
aw, say what?. or take what?
oh :P I meant like.. a line like, a telephone line... sorry
it's fine :P
I should've specified which line
:P nah, it's cool. . okay cool :D talk to you later perhaps :D. thanks. sorry for the double cool :P
:P. triple. bye :D wish me luck . maybe
:P you seem to be the guy with all of it
:P who else can find as many 4-leafers?
It's okay, it was cute :P if only I believed it. but you're special :D. byebye. (in a good way :P)
Oh thanks :D And hey, I hope your track meet went well. :D Maybe I can ask you how it went tomorrow. :P  Yay :D Tomorrow is like.. a Friday :D!!!. whoa sorry for the double send, I think my finger twitched or something :P. or y'know, it may have just been my computer making it look like I sent it twice. The refresh button cures all. :P Either way, I hope your pillows aren't gone when you wake up :P. oh, hi :D
:P lol oh yeah, leg twitches and finger twitches are very common nowadays with those rising oil prices. And about the pillows.. well, anything can happen, and it's nice to be prepared, y'know, just in case something does happen ;P. It's going good :D. did I hear correctly earlier? :P
That the great Peter Mattox has nothing to do on this Friday-like Thursday?
That's kind of crazy :P And I think it could apply
ooh, and especially with that 5 leaf clover and crazy speed :P
!!!!! :D!!! Oh my goodness! :D That's almost amazing. Wait, it is amazing! What kind of age range was this guy in? 
:D!! Even more amazing. I was ignorantly expecting it to be some oldish guy in a rocking chair :P
:P lol impulsively questioned/honored him? :D!! And that's really really cool--I hope you wrote it down or something so there's no chance of forgetting. How'd it go/what's it about? :D
Awesome :D :P lol you can get me back for that so-called rap
Maybe the first part was ;P And yups, I'm positive. It'd probably be a better use of my time :P 
:D!!! . It's good.. And that would be like, the most minimal compliment :P. Maybe walking is your muse :P
lol well I'd be glad to be useful to your lyrical talents :P
You're quite welcome :P. hmm, what are you doing later?
oh, same, same. :P Were you thinking of doing anything in particular. ?*
!! :D That's so cool! Do you sing in it? :P lol If only I could drive (and not pay for gas :P)
ohh, like little tykes? :D
awww, that sounds so cute :D!. Really, Orphans? o.o Sorry to ask like this, but it just seems so cliche. I mean like, a troop of singing orphans?
Well either way, i guess it seems pretty nice (:
:P lol well spring break has only just begun. there's still time :P. And maybe if you wanted, you could come over later and we could.. hmm.. chill? :P. maybe make some waffles..
:P lol see, it was too good to be true that "The great Peter Mattox" was free. oh whoops, I thought you meant like, you were even busier now :P
:D! ooh, jobs are cool
lol alright cool :P You sure you haven't any offers already?
:P whoa, this sounds like a fun job um, I'll stay online most likely, but you can catch me on my phone if I'm not :P Run Forrest Run :D!. And good luck. :P 
Whoa, you ran?. :P lol what exactly was your job, if I may ask?. sorry too, i think I got a job too :P You may want to find some other thing to do besides with me :P
whoa, you went into the old middle school? :D That's kind of awesome!  :D lol getting your instructions sounds all official. Like you're a secret agent or something.. Sorry. Have fun with stuffs :D
Me?
ohh, :/ yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I think it's just me and my bad timing :/ 
:P lol oh totally. But If I really was amazingly awesome, then you wouldn't keep missing me.
:P well what rhymes with around?
:D! lol it seems like a good word to use then
just like Timbuktu :D
:/ aw. As much as I love that soda and as much as I have one :P, you shouldn't feel too bad :/ Like, I feel like I wouldn't have contributed all that much to your night :P but I'm sorry for kind of preventing you from doing much else :/ 
aw :P I don't understand the reason behind any of your opinions of me, but thanks? You're pretty awesome yourself :D 
:P Okay, maybe I just don't agree with your reasons, I could come around though :P (no matter how unlikely)
:P lol it does sound like a boyfriend-y thing. You're not obligated to though :P, especially since it's not true :P (Sorry) . hmm, what's this look like? http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=165741493482319
lol "inordinate" :P. that's a nice way to put it :D. hmm, I think I feel like eating a smoothie :P. I just saw the word, and now I'm pretty set on it :P
lol I'm not sure if I'm gonna go make one though.. I don't know what I'd put in it ;P. :P*
whoa :P glitchy?
sorry, I think my computer has a weird memory :P or I'm typing things without knowing.. but ooh, I do have yogurt :D! and some berries :D. And pineapples :D. and some juice. And an apple :P
and cottage cheese :P. lol
blenders are too difficult to use :P And I'd rather be talking to you then have a smoothie :P . And I'm not sure about the bowling thingy yet, it sounds like it'd be a bunch of strangers
oh :P lol I only found about this 3 days ago, and didn't invite my closest friends :(  It's so deceptive :P
oh, it's fine :P sleep is very nice too
! :D I liked the yogurt part.. Aw, I wish I could drive.. :P
lol, so that my mom would be more open to me doing things :P or something like that.. Hmm.. what time is your curfew?
:P aw, I'm not sure though.. if it was anything, it'd only be until 11:30. ooh! :D Dessert rhymes with yogurt ish
oh, that's kind of neat :P 
Well anything involving you is definitely not a waste of time :P
like, more than positive (:
it is :D
I like you. (:
(: Will you be my boyfriend?
:D aw. yay. (: I'm sorry :P 
I don't know.. being weird :P It was just a random feeling
:P psh, that's what you think. I'm actually the very opposite of amazing. And I don't mean nizama :P
I'd say that you're the amazing one (: hmm, do you think I should use a recipe for the smoothie, or just improv? :P Oh, by the way, you can stop by if you want :P Even though it's really late and it'd only be for an hour or so and getting rides would be hard. :P Sorry, I wasn't sure if I should officially invite you or not, just because it sounds pretty unlikely anyway. There is always some other day though.
Whoa, really? :P You're not kidding? 
whoa, even with my 11:30 curfew? :D
aw, that's awesome :D lol Your dad is cool.
:P I get the two confused often, or maybe they just go together, but cool still sounds fitting. 
:P lol must've been some random creepy person
o.o. You're not that creepy :D You're pretty normal.. I think :P
well like, normal as in not creepy. But you're amazing as in not average. :P
whoa. O.o is it someone you know? and yes, I serious do want you here :D. If you don't mind seeing me in the process :P
:D yay :D! lol :P I hope there weren't any scary people at the door. byebye :D for now
I'm really really sorry. My heart and my hand were a little out of sync when I was writing that. :P  You totally looked at it though :P Like, what if it was the thingy I was actually thinking? But yeah, I hope you get hope safely and don't get in trouble and stuffs 
(: oh g'night. I like you. lots. sorry :P
:P mysteries are nice. Awww :( I totally know that really scary walking home alone in the dark feeling. Maybe you just need a portable boom box? (: aw I had a whole bunch of fun with you :D sorry for the awkward hugs though :P
:D you're an awesome bomb :P And you too (:. night
:D so it did :P and it'll always be there to remind you. until it blows up of course and releases all it's awesomeness, which will only make you more awesome :P
or both :P. lol just as long as you come back as a not-ghost, it'll be okay :P
:P lol well um.. um.. :P . Ghosts are scary :P And unhuggable. but mostly just scary
i like your personality though :D. lol sorry :P I did realize you were kidding, ish
I'll quit rambling and let you get to sleep now. :P. oh of course :P
Dark alleyways? :P Aw, I'm still sorry bout those though. :P G'night you. 
lol is it all the ghost talk?
wait, you're unhuggable? :P
lol no wonder i have so much trouble hugging you :P
:P It's okay, I forgive you. :P lol sorry
But see, this way, it's easier for me to like resist hugs :P even if I've been a failure so far
Aw (: maybe thoughts of me create immunity from shady men? :P lol sorry. :P aw, everything everything? 
aw, how?
:P awwww.. not because of your unhuggabliity though :P And I shouldn't be resisting hugs anyway.  and nah, you seem like you can fix things :D
aw, no I like your hugs (: I think I just make them weird by being awkwardly positioned. They feel all warm though (: and fuzzy :P
Aw (: Well, That's really good. Because I like when you're happy (:. :P What'll happen one of these days? 
ooh, and umm.. When we drive in my car? :P 
aw (: Well I think that day already happened for me :P
yes, or at least, I think so :P. ooh, Whispers: "Goodbye, I'll miss you quite terribly". lol I can hear the background music
here in your arms? :P is that it?
:P sorry, I'm being narcoleptic. I like you (:
But yeah, I guess it is just a tad late :P
(:. aw I <3 Peter. :P. jellybeans are love
:P
or like. (: aw. That almost looks bumperstick worthy if the name was different :P
(:  aw. Next time I eat jellybeans, I have a whole new perspective (: but awwwww... I feel all special now. :3
Whoa, sorry, just thinking of you too much :P makes me light heated. lol :P sorry. byebye (: You're awesome
It's okay, it's nice most of the time :P Sweet dreams to you too (:
lol :P not what I meant (: and with that 5 leaf clover, that should be in no time :P  byebye. You're so awesome (:
I can't wait (:
Well that's okay, I think once you touch it, the luck is yours too :D
 (: Maybe it is crazy then. :D And maybe you're super duper lucky :P. bye (:. Thanks for being you (:
:P lol I do try :P . And I'm glad you're not anyone else :D
Nothing would :P. or wait.. :P you mean if you told me right now that you were someone slse?
:P oh yeah, then nothing would happen
:P lol sorry
(: you're nice. (: 
definitely is a strong word :P . And that sounds like some hard shoes too fill. those*
(: aw, well, I'll try to continue doing what I have been thne :P 
you're good (:
That doesn't make sense :P bbut I wiash I was, I'm really not good enough for you, sorry to start this up again
(: Well thanks for saying so, but your opinion may be a bit bias ;p No that i'm doing a DBQ or anything ;p
Mine isn't though :P it's just yours. Yours is special and bias and stuff. 
Well can I accept you then?
aw yay (: acceptance is cool. And so are you. And if I went back in time, I'd bring you back the first pineapple ever. i bet it looks like a dinosaur.
You'd have to get tinier though :P or maybe justenlarge the dino shaped pineapple. That'd be one rockin' house :P And maybe the pineapple could never expire (:
oh yeah :P no, i think that's a good good assumption. And if it were in texas, then it'd be double as large and you could be on cribs (: . And okay (: me too I think
G;night person (: You have fun too (: I think hugging you is still on my mind (: it's all nice and warm feeling. you have fun too :D it''s never a dull activity :P
(L yay. Dogs are cool, and I hope you have fun and don;t get bitten out of or anything (: I'll let you go sleep up for those adventures awaiting you tomorrow (:. If my brain was a church, i think the steeple would be upsidedown
Good luck with all that :D I think you'll be fine. Dogs are all pretty nice at heart and they fetch you things. (: Dogs are so cool. . G'night (: 
(: Thank you, bugs hurt and they crawl like little murderers :P Sorry to keep you for so long, if this sis what's keeping you. (: You're really cool. Bybye
I'm not sure, I was thinking it might be me, but I can't believe that you'd stay up just to say few words to me.. So I think it's probably something else
:P lol sorry about that. Ooh, and maybe :D I wish today wasn't so cold :P all the other 3 days of break will be at least in the 70s though :D
:D Good news, weather man says that tomorrow'll be sunny with a high of 79 (Relient K sounding?) (: And by weather man, I mean my google home page, which I'd consider to be about the same besides the magic green screen background and suit and pointing and stuff. :D  ooh, I hope the art show was/is fun, and I hope that the dogs weren't too scary :P I hear dogs like people who feed them, so maybe if you already did that, you'd be fine. :D Walking them sounds exciting besides the whole plastic bag bit. lol hmm, I've always wondered how people get those little sweaters on the dogs :P So, I feel like I feel a whole lot more productive on non-school days. Well, maybe productive wouldn't be quite the right word since I haven't touched my homework :P but I guess I mean like.. hmm.. more thoughtful. Like, I guess there's just a whole bunch more time to think about stuff and do stuff you don't normally get to do. I can't wait for summer this year. :D  P.S. My ukulele is officially tuned! (:  G'night! Should I um, sign my name even though it says it at the top?  - Leandra (I decided to anyway :P , but now I'm thinking it looks weird) P. P.S. I did not drink coffee at any point today. Or orange juice. 
lol :P yeah, i was wondering where the run was hiding, but now i realize that some clouds are probably holding him hostage. :P Happy Saturday! :D. Whoa! Just after i sent that, the sun came out :P
Pretty cool art sounds, well, pretty cool :D! Was it all mixed styles? Or did it consist of only sculptures made entirely out of Wisconsin cheese? :D lol And awesome :P I hope the dogs went okay again, and I hope they hadn't been let out. :P  ooh, and thanks (: I hope your Saturday is awesome too.. oh hi :D
I'm really really good :D How've you been?
(: That's sounds good. How is dog-sitting? :P
Aw, I bet they're only barking at you to show their appreciation and blind love :P
I don't doubt that :P
Aw :( No way, I'm still gonna say that growling was just out of love and respect for you :P
:P Your mom.. It totally applies in this case.
Oh, and a bunch of dawgs you've only known for about 2 seconds in dog years :P
:P psh, well for all you know, maybe that gout guy went into the future just so he could go back in time and quote you :P  
whoa, but there's so much more to you than just a face and a hand. There's like.. arms that you could throw frisbees with.. and legs that they could climb up and knock you over by :P
:D That does sound really really cool! It sounds like, an actual art show, like those ones displayed in museums and stuff :D!!! Whoa, what if you listened to a song called 'wallking the dog' while you walked the dogs? :P! That'd be neat. ooh, why 7? :P You going to that thingy too?. :P psh, well, that's probably enough for the dogs to love you by
Exactly :D good thing humans can perceive more than that too though.
yeah :P It means that if dogs love you for just that, then people should love you like decatuple as much
:D Maybe it'd only work at night though? Or maybe by that line it means that it's actually daytime? hmm.. oh yeah, that :P whoops. 
:P yeah, it does--unless it's just really quiet, so it's like the stuff going on at night is dead? :P but morning sounds better, especially since he's supposedly walking a dog :P  Whoa, so, were you aware that they made a music video for it? :D!!!!!!!!!!!!! And after Dog Problems, you better believe it's just as awesome :P  . Oh, probably something :P maybe just some piano music at squires, or an easter egg hunt or something. I didn't have much in mind when I said it though :P . Sorry, that was a really colorful music video :P
It's like, amazing :D!! It inspires me to change colors. Oooh! maybe it's some strong statement about racial acceptance :D! Or abstaining from drugs.
oh :P Well I'm not sure exactly what it is, but there are some low-key ArtFusion events there.
:P lol I haven't youtubed that song since before the creation of the video. ooh, are you eating some right now? :P if so, I'm totally gonna go ninja and like, go over to your how and get some. And it'll be so fast that you just won't know what happened :P one minute, you'll be eating ice cream, and the next, your spoon with be totally clueless at what it was trying to pick up. Um, yeah.  . Well, Doctor Who is probably more exciting :P I mean, with a 50 year legacy like that, I'm surprised that they don't show it in sports bars :P
Oh it's fine :P Whoa, that like, really old :P Good thing the plotline was so flexible for replacing actors :P
:P Who knows. Which came first, national football, or a crazy reincarnating screwdriver guy? :P sorry if that description is off
tee hee :P Britain seems so advanced
whoa.. whoaaaa!!!. :P . lol is it weird that I associated the super bowl with the year 1936? which is like, the inverse of 1963?. hmm.. Doctor Who came before Pink Floyd o.o
:P And they're British too, so maybe they watched it :P
lol :P "Say no to dentures'
:P lol! . do dentures need braces?. :P
:P lol Well it was nice anyway. And yay! :D It does!! :D Makes me wanna go do something out there.
hmm, I hear water gun/balloon fights are fun :P
:P oh I guess you're right.. :P It'd just be like, playing in a kitty pool all alone or swimming alone or throwing water balloons at yourself or something :P bu not everyone is off on vacation somewhere though, right?
:P lol are guys allowed to be Debbie downers? because if so... :P lol sorry, kidding. You are fun though :D I can think of at least 4 million people who would like to spend time with you. and I don't think i even know that many people :P
:D . yay
yeah. :P it is okay.. sorry :P
um. for saying stuff? :P
Aw, thanks :P that makes me feel a little better. You should know that you're amazingly awesome as well :D (I use "As Well" tentatively though, since I'm not quite sure that I fall into the same category.)  Whoa, so hmm.. have you seen this little number called "Traffic Warden"? :P
! :P It's so awesome! :P Like, I didn't know videos could be so inspirational and cultural before I saw it. :P I don't understand how they'll ever find the little fishes though, but I guess the main thing was that they survived? :P oh and something about love too, but I didn't catch that moral. 
:P oh, is that what you got from it? . It sounds about right :P I like to think they already knew each other before that incident though. . ooh, and that when delivering hankerchiefs, you should bring an inhaler :P
They kissed *a bunch* in the fountain :P
It would be so weird. psh, I don't think that kiss was just over fish and hankerchiefs :P . Whoaaaa :D!! . it is real!. (and I don't mean the magnificent plaid dinosaur)
oh, acoustic Hey Ya :P That guy in your grade did a cover :D
lol :P it's totally possible though. And the lyrics are so thoughtful :P
hmm. Life is cool (:
:P Can I be rubber. ?*
noo :P. glue is sticky and feels weird on your fingers
:P psh, that's what you think. But inside, I know that you're the glue :P
:P lol i think I have some glue that gets like that.. like.. hmm.. hot glue when it dries and no longer works? :P
Whoa, so I finally figured out what that amazing song is called! :P
oh, that too :P . but also another one. ooh, it turns out that first one was by the beatles :P no wonder it was familiar
:P you might know of it.. First,  Tell me if this sounds familiar..." I said a hip hop the hippy to the hop and you don't stop" or some similar gibberish.. :P
!! yes! :P . it was tough to find for me :P but I found a few versions with amazing lyrics, and here's the one with the best video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL7iWLFSH6Y. ahh, it makes me love rap even more :P
:P tee hee. I know! It's some crazy video skillz
and the best part: "Hotel, motel, holiday inn" :P
:P lol psh, you should hear the 14 minute version :P. it's kind of smart lyrics though. Sorry, I'm a little bias toward some rap of modern times too :P. I think I know what you're sayin though
:P lol they have cool names :P. lol I thought this line was really cool: She said I go by the name of Lois Lane And you could be my boyfriend you truly can Just let me cut my boyfriend called Superman I said he's a fairy I do suppose Flyin through the air in pantyhose but I said I need a man who got finesse and his whole name across his chest :P 
it's amazing :P. it inspires me to be a better person :P
i know :P rap is just.. so powerful
:D it rhymes :D. double-y
It's okay, it's not a bad thing :P. :D I like spring break.. I think I'm gonna go outside
:P aw, okay. If you say so. hmm
I hope you do too :D!! It's a really really really really awesome day!. ooh, and doctor who :P. maybe I'll watch it for the first time ever tonight
:P aw, would you really want to? Isn't there some more dedicated fan you'd rather share the moment with?
psh, like you could ever do that :P you'd be enhancing it
:P lol psh, well I'm not going outside on an empty stomach, so it may be a few minutes before the sun can [lovingly] attack me with UV rays :P
:P oh yeah, my time is just way to valuable for an amazing person like you.. too*
:P only if you're as startastic as me
:P tee hee. that's funny, because it sounds like that one word fa-cee-tious, but it looks like face.  Okay.. um.. this is awkward, because after i wrote this, I became aware that that is actually how you spell "that one word" :P I left my silly comment intact though, just so you could see my un-smartness too.. wow :P sorry. I feel seriously handicapped now.. like, my brain is just rolling around in a wheelchair :P. (:
oh it's fine :P I was just so positive that you were um.. emulating my startasticism by creating another pun.  And yes, that's my attempt at redeeming myself with what I consider to be smart sounding words :P. :P Oh, I'm so happy about it :P Well, I'm not sure. But sometimes it's nice to feel dumb. 
lol nah :P I have a full time 'dumb feeling', but sometimes it's more severe than normal. For examples, please scroll up :P  It's kind of like that.. "Wow, I can't believe I was thinking that :P" feeling.
lol :P your smart cookie joke was about cookies :P. :P would you believe me if I said I've only heard the 401k term a few times on the news and had no idea what it was referring to?
it sounds so familiar though... lol :P Gosh, I can't believe you didn't know what it was, Peter.. like, you of all people :P. :P. what do you say for yourself?
psh, no :P it just means that you're not retiring anytime soon or in the workforce. 
Oh, you should :P That was just unacceptable back there.
I'm not sure if I can still be friends with *someone like you*. :P
aw, no.. I'm kidding.. even though you might be too.. but like, once it gets to crying in corners, that's too far :(. sorry. aw, were your parents eaten by whales too? :(. sorry 
:( wait nooo.. withering should only be done by really really really old people and plants.
actually, i may have to withdraw really old people from that. just plants then.. I can't tell if you're kidding anymore, but I sure was.. not about the plant though, those do wither often
okay, that's good :D
:P wait.. only "certain bits"?
...
I think you deserve way better, but to make up for it, I'm still trying :P 
nah, i want to.. I wanna be the very best , the best there ever was :P
to train them is my cause! *dun dun dun *
lol :P okay, I think we all know the rest.
... 'gotta catch'em all :D Pokemon!". lol sorry, had to end it so it wouldn't keep playing in my head :P
:D yay.. I spreaded happiness.. in the form of nostalgia.. hopefully. sprad*. spread*
:D!! yay. That's even more amazing :P . And you're like, the amazingness of all. but, I better go get that chicken/cookie and clean my room :P . hmm, what pokemon thing was it exactly?
oh yeah :D!! I love where he licks Jesus.. Sorry :P. ooh, and the random spongebob boxers? If i remember correctly?. :P sorry. you're anything but a waste of time though
:P even if you press the "Credit" button? that normally works..
aw, well, I won't use hope :P. because even the impossible can become possible if you just remove 'im :P
and possibly cliche :P
:P what if I said that you're actually benefitting me by talking to me?. because like, you throw happiness everywhere :D
:P definitely not true. I'll prove it one day :D. did you really want to do that doctor who thing?
:P hmm... Well, I'll definitely keep my schedule open :P
:P well at least 6-9? . or so
nothin' better than being with you (: :P
aw yay (:. I like your smile :P 
(: aw, thanks.  :P You're pretty amazing. And on that note, I'll talk to you later :P And hopefully be able to do something with you doctor-who related
yay :D ttyl
ttys*
:P!. it's so warm :D!. or rather, was when the sun was more out :P. sorry, I'll talk to you later when you're actually there :P
oh hey :P! it's fine, I'm still hereish
:P lol it's okay, really, the only important thing I'd want to do is talk to you :D
:D dog sitting sounds so cool! And I know that snacks are awesome :P 
yay :D What kind of snack? 
:P lol that's a big snack :P . but awesome sounding. granola bar sandwich? :D
lol :P I need to try it some time.
:P Well, in that case, that 'some time' would probably be a post-apocalyptic world where only granola and bread plants exist :P
nah :P only if I had some neverending supply of glowing stars with smiley faces.
:P lol no. But I hear it instills invincibility in anyone who crashes into it.
:P!! can never go wrong with mushrooms :P That'd be so cool! :P it'd be like... a rocket?
:D yay
lol :P It sounds Irish when I read it.
it's okay, i'm down with the irish stuff. :P
aw, sorry for what then? :P you're awesome
oh, no It's fine :P
Well, okay then, but it's really not as important as you :P
I do say :D
oh, okay. Aw, did you still want to? :P
:P oh, nah, I'm still pretty free
Aw, Well I want to.. just like... I'm afraid that my TV is a little bit Doctor-Who-less :P No BBCA over here.
nah, it's cool :P hmm, did you know that Doctor Who aired about 5 hours ago or so in the UK?
oh, I guess I meant like, It's fine. :P I've never seen it before, so I feel like I won't be missing it too much. 
:P. :P okay, just kidding, with the power of the internet... 
:P I'm not sure.. how do you feel about.. illegal activities?
well um.. :P mass murder?
lol :P don't worry, I'm clean besides my honey nut cheerios
:P !! lol :P I'm um... a closest cereal killer. . closet*
So don't tell anybody :P
aw, thanks (: Well, y'see.. Every morning.. I... :P eat cereal.
There tends to be a lot of snapping and cracking and popping sometimes
:P lol my cereal is seriously serious about me seeming like such a serial killer
:P oh, nah, but mass murder and cereal killing is about the same thing
aww, my poor computer :P
:P oh, it's not your fault, it just drop it way too often :P. And I'd never ever ever want you to disappear forever.. because like, forever seems like a long time, and a long time without you would be like.. sad :(
yay (:
(: lol nice :P 
:P lol I wouldn't ask that of you
:P lol well that doesn't sound like a fair exchange
:P lol that doesn't make sense but you wouldn't be wasting my time at all

Really? :D . hmm, got any homework?

o.o. remind me not to touch your hair :P
:P lol oh yeah, you never know what could be hiding up there.. aw (:
oh whoops :P I accidently hit the space bar :P
ohh :P lol there may have been, but I by no means was planning on typing it out for you :P
:P mayybee... It wouldn't be a secret if you knew that there was even a secret :P
:P see, it just works out so much better this way :P. You're amazing :D. you like, don't even have to try. You could just be like, sitting there, and I'd think you're the most amazing person in the world (:
You're so so amazing :D I'm surprised your brain hasn't realized it by now. . Ah, I think I have to go get some homework done right about now :P. it shouldn't be tooooo bad though :P
:P lol or maybe I'll just chug through, like a train :P  aw, wait.. you have a secret? :D!
do you? :P
:P aw, playing the same card that I did?
well... okay.. I guess I just have to live without knowing :P. aw.. wait.. it's not really a secret unless you tell someone, right? :D
aw, well you're only 3 people, so that doesn't count :P. Yours seemed like a more valid point than mine though
you, yourself, and um.. thee. or wait.. . is it.. 'thou"?. :P. yeah
no, it's fine :P. I'm curious though :P. will I ever find out?
aw (: Well, I really really really really really like you too :D. and that does sound important :D Maybe I'll just have to find out some other day? :P
aw (: I love your songs :P even if that one is unrelated to you? :P. :D you make a good lyricist in my opinion
:P psh, I don't believe that, because it's what you said about most things, and I thought those were like.. aaaaaaa-mazing :D
(: aw. That's how I feel about you. Like, all the words can't even sum up what's going on in my brain, and they don't capture just how amazing you are... you're like.. (:
aw (: it's a heart :D. I wish I could tell you stuff.. it was crazy, but today, like.. I had that weird butterfly feeling again. and I dunno. I hope just saying "That weird butterfly feeling" sums it up :P I still kind of have it, like, right now, because I'm talking to you
yes (: but aw, wait, really? you too?  :D. maybe we'll save it for a rainy day :{P or sunny day. lol whoops :P unintentional mustache
wait, it's not bad :P it's good, and rhymeyish :P. so you can breathe :D please?. it's like HelloGoodbye's title :D
I thought it was good :P even if it is unrelated
aw wait, breathe :P . hmm, I've never been able to hold my breath for longer than a minute before :P. aw, Peter?. you there?
aw, I guess so.. I do like your song though :D. was that your secret? :P
psh, keeping an amazing song a secret is just criminal :P
lol :P well as long as you have 2 dices and that 4 leaf clover, you should get out in no time :P
:(. aw, can I come?. sorry, what were you typing before I interuppted? :P
to be with you, of course :D. I'm not sure I could handle it though :P. I hear they don't have nutella in jail..
:P I'd say it'd be the only reason to :D
:P oh, that may be a minor setback. but aw, thanks :P That really means a lot :P. I think as long as you offered some to the wardens, they would let it slip :P
lol :P must be. Everyone loves nutella, so you could probably have anything you wanted from a bunch of crazy nutella depraven prisoners :P
You're something (:. sorry to bring up how amazing you are :P
you're like, everything (:
(: I'm sure you mean a bunch to some other people as well :D
:P even if that is corny and shouldn't be true, it still makes me feel all butterfly-ey
:P lol the first on is a bad reason, but you feeling amazing is good (: . (: you make me all happy and special-feeling and stuffs :P. and you're a really cool person to be around :P. ah, I'm sorry. I'll let you get to sleep or something now :D so g'night and see ya tomorrow home skizzle :P
(: aw, internets should be more lively :P And I love spending time with you (n' stuff :P)!
:P lol it's okay, i really didn't notice at all :P And smooth um, recovery there :P  aw, toes hurt when they get stubbed :(
whoa, maybe it like numbs it or something ? :P. ouch :(. or maybe it's like, improv ice? :P
whoa, :P lol that sounds like a nice technique.. ooh, prepared for what? :P
:P aw, is this another secret?
aw, I'm racking my brain, but it feels a little cobwebby today :P. How's the rest go? :P
I think I like your version better :P
I hope so :P
:P lol That's not a bad thing. That reminds me of the title of yet another Hellogoodbye song :P
:P is it like, a feeling in your tummy that's like twice the butterfly feeling?
:P oh, and maybe some heart flutters thrown in there too?
if it sounds accurate, that's because a first hand account :P. it's*
I think I know what you mean... like, I thought for sure that it would go away after I got to know you better or something. :P I hope we're talking about the same thing. And it doesn't sound lame. hearing it from you just makes me like, more nervous feeling :P or something
Oh, well.. I'm talking about butterflies and such :P . what are you talking about? :P
oh, I had that in mind too :P
:P It's kind of scary. Like, not spider scary..but like... hmm :P I don't know either. and it's alright, it's not dumb
nah, that word sound too.. spider-like :P
:P yeah.. like.. hmm.. nervousness-inducing?
:P lol I think about it when I listen to Hellogoodbye :P
lol yes, but maybe mainly because of that one song :P
lol :P yeah, those are just terrible thoughts
:P lol nervousness-inducing then?
:P lol I'm sorry about that
I like hugging you though (: :P . sorry
lol :P you're awesome for introducing me to Tony Hawks. the videogame of course, not the real person :P
you're awesome for just about everything you do :D
You're welcome :P . ah, we should really get to sleep :P. but only because tomorrow is a school day :P. I really really really like you (:. I'm sorry I keep saying that :P
(: aw, well okay. I just don't want to bee all weird and clingy-sounding :P. be*
That's good :D I don't think you come across like that either
:P lol oh no, that'd be terrible :P. to outside observers I mean :P
lol :P ahh, you're still really really really cool :D. And on that note..
See you tomorrow? :D
G'night to you too :D. aw :(
playing hooky?. lol the question mark looks like a hook :P. but yay :D
:P psh, but school is so much more than that. it's a chance to see Jappy n company too :P
:P Well I don't see what sets me apart besides the obvious :P
psh, well that's just silly :P. but anywho, yeah :D. If I had a grandfather clock, it would be going crazy right now.... :P
whoa!! That's so cool :D. lol I wish my clock was a grandfather. then it'd wear cool hats and stuff. but yeah, the chiming could be problematic with sleep patterns :P
you too :D. peace out :D
lol see ya home skillet
:P lol Ditto. I think you've found a four leaf clover at least once every day :P. omg!! :D
:D!! . I think you would've enjoyed glee tonight :P. !!!
:P yes!! like... !!! :D!!! omg!!. so... I thought the song sounded familiar at first... and when they got to the chorus, I was like, "omg!! I have to go tell Peter!" :P so that's what I'm doing now.. even though I haven't really told you anything yet :P
this is to say that the Very Potter Musical guy sang that one song, Somewhere Only We Know :D. good combination, possibly?. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuNCZe1cHFk
sorry :P hope that wasn't old news
but yeah, I'll leave you to find out :P aw. :P. lol I gotta get back to the last bits of Glee :P. ttyt
:P lol Well the original will always be the most specialist.. i guess :P. special-est?*. yes, I did just mis-spell a made up word :P. :P hopefully you were kidding though? I mean, there is a little smiley by that statement... aw, why is that sad? maybe they just know that it's special to you.. It'd be like someone finding a bunch of cakes everywhere they go, and even if it was perfectly good cake, they might feel weird about just taking it from you. :P Plus, maybe what makes four leaf clovers so special is just that feeling you get when you spot the one-in-a-million oddity among thousands of regular clovers. Just finding one is a kind of monumental achievement and the four leaf clover is a tangible confirmation of that. So y'see, taking one from someone else would just be like having a bunch of trophies with someone else's name engraved on them. :P 
Aw :/ is it really that sad?  And I'd still say it's pretty impressive. :D lol wow :P I hope you were being sarcastic for that last part though, any other way would just be completely bonkers. :P But assuming that you were being completely genuine :P, I'd respond that that just proves how lucky you are, and hating yourself for that would just be silly. You should love your um.. Irish-given gift of special shamrock detecting? :P It's kind of lightning-y right now, so I wonder what tomorrow will be like. :D Probably magical and rainbow-y, or just even stormy-er. :P  I'll see ya tomorrow possibly! :D If you dream of magic marshmallows tonight, please tell me. :P . Whoa, Montgomery county has a flash flood warning for tonight. O.o. I don't think it's too serious though. *knock on wood.** I try not to be superstitious, but this just gives me a sense of redemption in case something bad actually does happen. :P Like, it wouldn't possibly be my fault for the flash floods because I totally knocked on wood. :P Yeah, See ya :D That magic marshmallow thing still applies :D
oh hi :D
Ooh, I'm good :D I was just off to bed so I could wake up all early :P
:P nah, it's fine
Whoa, did you hear among the talking during track that there was actually a tornado warning yesterday accompanying all that lightning? O.o And awesome :D hmm, well I guess marshmallows are always magical in a way. (: :D ooh cool! hmm, which 'Ghetto playground" were you referring to? Like.. the one with the graffiti? Or the one in close proximity of my house? :P I would consider both to be pretty ghetto. How did that go anyway? :D And whoa, you're totally right :D like the square root of negative one actually is less than 3. :P lol, I like how it didn't make a heart with the i<3u :P . it's totally fine :D like, you're not a bother :P
aw, you shouldn't feel like that, you're like, one of the least bothersome people ever, if people could be bothersome :P
aww, I'm trying to decide which We The Kings song to send you, because I think a lot of them are really good :P, but sending you all of them would just be crazy.. I like this one quite a lot though :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iInoyhz_iA
:P you can stop apologizing, you really didn't do anything wrong. And it's cool, i'm leaving in a second or so anyway, I just get distracted easily :P
I think the < 3 turned into a heart again :P . but yeah :D see ya (: If I'm not completely sleep deprived from my endeavor at experiencing a historical event live :P
:P well in that case, I guess it was a good thing that it turned into a heart :D lol :P I'll try to be the awesomest zombie ever.
lol :P did you get that off a bumper sticker? 
 lol well maybe if  I did have cute boots it would apply. :P And okay :D I'll try. Bye :D
:P ohh, okay, lol :P I wouldn't agree, but thanks?  Bye :D . lol :P I need to be more original with my goodbyes
It'd mean the mostest from you :D
Maybe your heart can figure it out :P . Can't stay, blue jay :P. so I'll see ya tomorrow :D
:D I hope your day goes pretty amazingly too! :P lol hmm, well, that new movie did come out :P lol. sorry..
oh, you're not :D
lol :P Me either. But it's fine really, psh, it's not like I was doing anything important anyway :P . :v. me either
Yeah :P I tend to do that often
oh um, the first bit :P I just bother myself sooo much. like, I can't even be in the same room with me for more than 2 minutes :P. (kidding of course)
:P oh yeah, I'm terrible with sarcasm
:D lol now I can't tell if you're being sarcastic
that way i'll know that stuff is fo sho? :P 
:P ooh, that's always a plus--for me I mean. :P
ask me if today works for me? :P
oh :P aw, well you're a pretty awesome person :D. lol I'm working on my campaign video :D . it's due on the 4th O.o
lol oh yeah :P I forgot about that special occasion. Oh, I'm really sidetracked, so I'm really not doing much of anything :P . but I should probably go anyway to save you from um.. . distractedness :P
I wish that you're not a terrible person :D. but that's already true
That's a silly thing to wish for :P you can always see me run badly tomorrow though. . And again, you're not a terrible person
:P aw, well that's nice, but wanting to see me is kind of crazy. :P Sorry all these responses are sounding pretty similar. My brain and cookies, when combined, lead to... not much at all. :P See, if that wasn't true, then I would've been able to come up with a more eloquent punchline for that.  And why do you think that wise turtle?
:P It's very very crazy, almost as crazy as thinking what you just said. You do stuffs right and are cool. :D and I bet you make the best cereal. ever.
A-ha! so you agree on your amazing cereal skillz? :P. sorry. but stuff you do is cool. yeah.
Falso :D. lol :P well it's the other kind of important.. like.. homework important--which really isn't important at all even though it actually is important. My brain just automatically puts it on the same importance scale as fried bananas :D
:putnam:
Asi, asi! :D. yeah.. 
totally okay, though I'm clueless as to what you did :P
I'm gonna requote myself again :P but that's a silly feeling to have. you should feel like, awesome and stuffs.
yay :D that's good :D!. **confetti pop*
aw :(
does this make you feel awesome? : (")>. lol :P. that is a messed up penguin..
aw, well I'd be glad to be of service :P
:P um you're welcome, and it's okay? though I deserve neither the thank you nor the apology :P
aw :/ well that doesn't make you terrible.. I'd say that'd make it the other way around
aw :( . Well maybe there's no such thing as a waste of time... like, I bet you could find merit in just sitting around eating cookies :P. maybe... but I know there's definitely something in talking to you that makes it amazingly worthwhile :P (aka not a waste of time)
yay :D just make sure you don't hold them in your left hand
oh, I'm not really sure :P
yay :D. you can put that word in your left hand. just to make it ironic. ah, I gotta go :D um, bye friend. Have a good night :D. And remember.... ...You are awesome. (:
completely fine, though not true :P Or if it is true, then it's a severe case of yellow journalism :P. :D. byebye
wait? :D
I'm waiting. (:
dum dum dum, da da dum dum dum, (jeopardy music) :D. :D
lol it's fine, didn't you hear that little doobly doo earlier about how you're not a waste of time? :P
aw.
Well, I think that's important. I love talking to you and stuffs too :D
what else is there?  :P . sorry, silly question. but I care abouts you and stuffs too :D. yeah, stuffs is a nice obscure word :P
as long as it's your left hand :P. lol :P sorry, I think I've overused that for today
It's okay, I don't know what it means either :P It was just a random comment at the time. aw :( why does your heart hurt?
maybe I could clear it up?. aw, maybe I should've just put 'boy' in front of that :P
aw.. any advice on what to clear up exactly? :P
:/ aw, well I think you're special :oD
sorry
not clearing things up :P. i'm not like Windex :P
aw :( . well I'm just really reallly silly..
lol :P maybe not this kind... hmm... why do you feel like just another guy?. you're not though :D. aw, maybe facebook is glitchy today.. I'll talk to you later or something :D. G'night :D
lol me being cute (which isn't true) didn't have to do with anything :P You're awesome though, and definitely not just another guy :D! I really hope you didn't walk home, because you looked kind of like you were :( I thought you were covered though :/ 
Hi you :D
:( um, your cat?
:( aw. did you really really walk?
oh.
:(
aw. adventures are fun. I should've like given you a ride, I mean, I was going the same way anyway
Well, she even offered for you :P I think she said that Brenda was too far out of the way or something. aw :(. noodle legs
awwwww :( i wish you had a phone. I feel bad :(
well, i could've given you a ride
:(. :'(
i'm gonna go eat a um.. water. um. bye :D
:P sorry. ;Dhave a nice day . 8:D
:D*. aw :(. :'(
I don't know, thinking of you walking home just makes me all sad :'(
:(
you aren't boring :D . I hope your night is really fun too :D
hitch hike?. look at a map?. ask for directions?
give someone your shirt?
oh.
whoa.
That's kind of illegal :P
psh, was following the main roads just too boring for you? :P
oh, I see. :P  Yay :D those are the two things that should be included in every tornado victim's survival kit :P
:P aw, well brownies are good with controllers
:( 
...
:'(. yes, talking to you is really making me this sad :P
aw, no that's even worser! o.o!. and it's fine, I'm kidding ish.. It's probably just guilt for not giving you a ride :(
:( Aw, well, for future reference, I like giving you rides because that means that you're not all alone walking and that I get to see you an extra few minutes
I mean, you're on the way.. :D . and it's very great. I'm gonna go eat that water now.. :P
that's just because I feel really really bad that you had to walk and stuff :'(
:(
thanks :P
lol I'll even make chewing noises. :D lol I'm gonna go to sleep soon
:P because I got to hand out with you and stuffs :D. aw :(
go fine vera :D. aloe vera :D. :P. find*
Well, I got some in my room that you could use
:P lol yeah. You need to get from there to here.
I would; you're amazing. I need a hug anyway :P. sorry, kidding
Well maybe I'd say I'm kidding just to not sound like a creeper. but that'd just be even creepier :P
:P oh, well, the aloe vera is scented, i think.. I really wouldn't care much though :P. lol. You're sweaty?. oh yeah, you did say you just got home..
whoa.
marathon man
:{P lol that's such a weird word
I haven't heard anyone use it since like.. that hefty commercial
:( aw, but you really really don't. I like being around you bunches :D  it makes me sad when you're sad though :(  
aw. well you should get some aloe :P and go do stuff
maybe I could send it to you through the computer? :P
omg that's a great idea :D!. besides the cd tray part.. don't you think the usb slot would be a much better candidate? 
lol :P I could just like squeeze it straight in
:D. then my computer will have awesome sunburn relief too
aw, nah, I could totally stay :D
lol as eating water?
well I could live about 3 days without that.. but I think I could only live about 2 without you... :P lol sorry. over-dramatic?
:P because I'd be you-deprived?
lol :P don't be sick for any longer than that
o.o whoa, how long ago? That sounds like a scary disease. :P  Whoa, really? Is that where the idea of 'cutting' came about from? hmm, I think I've felt both at the same time before :P might've been an illusion though. . does emotional pain ever trump physical pain then?
o.o Well, I don't believe it :P. I think the only way to get rid of emotional pain is to like... eat desserts :P. lol sorry, bad idea
maybe doing happy things is better. ooh yum :D. brownies are good
:P lol it sounds terribly corny and unbelievable. but it makes me want to see you :D
yay :D
awesome :D. lol :P I'd be in my pajamas
yay :D you know what that means?  
yes!! :D better known as a pajama party! :D
The woodpecker sighs. :D
:D Oh, I was deathly serious. . the wolf sits below, hungry and lonely :D
well, maybe not deathly.. but :P. oh, it's just "And howls to the moon: "if only, if only" Sort of sad, really :(
:P nah, I'm rather rather not amazing. :/
ish
oh, I'm fine with not being amazing :P
it's something else ish :/ although I kind of don't want to say that, because it leads to more questions, but I was the one who put the face in the first place :P (accidental rhyme?)
:/ lol :P I like how specifically put 'hands' instead, since we're typing instead of talking :P
:. :D* :P. ooh, I like hearing your voice :D, oh, and being with you :P
oh, it's okay, ti's really not that bad. :P. it's*. but tis make it sound cooler.
:P lol, well thanks for that. :P lol even if that means breaking out the sticker-smileys?
I don't know why though, I'm just like.. I don't know, like, 1 person out of a bunch. I mean, I'm sure you care about other people to, but those people are probably justifiably awesome :P
:P like a thumb?
lol :P aw. sounds like a nice little hallmark card. :D sorry
Well, I guess it'd mean that you're able to say extremely meaningful stuff :P  I think I actually really want to see you too.. :/. just to win that thumb war though :P
lol :P if only we lived in california for a second. it's still dinnertime round there :P
ah, I gotta do that campaign thingy tomorrow :/  And an elephant's tummy of studying. :P 
lol :P are you sure? maybe you're an awesome studying budyy
buddy* whoops, wrong double letter :P
whoa, like.. possible tonight? :P i think it might be just a little late for that
aw, wait :/ I'm just being silly and stuff. but if you do have to leave your computer :P
It's really really really really silly.. . and it can :D
aw :( I remember having a sun burn on my tummy last summer, and so I'm imagining that so I can have some comparison. I'm sorry o.o It must be bad.  . wait, what is the really really thing? :P
oh. :P. trust me, it's bad. lol :P "Yeah.... I have a Canadian friend... I went to her birthday party when I was 9 and the gamecube button said Zed.."
lol!! :P
it's funny, right? And okay :D
lol :P I've always wanted to be tiger... but maybe one stripe doesn't qualify you?
"earn your stripes" :P what they never told you is that you would have to endure sunburn for them
Whoa, me either! :D lol If it's a 3 day weekend, then that'd make it even awesomer! :D lol the next day off I'm waiting for is Memorial Day though. Whoa, you should do it :D It sounds daring. Like, sticking your hand in ice for the longest amount of time, but in this case, it would be like your whole body instead. :P. And okay, g'night :D Adieu to you too. (Do you think French people say 'goodbye' to mix things up a little?) :P
aw, don't lose hope! Maybe false hope is worse in some situations though.  I hope your night is full of nice dreams and everything but Freddy the accordion player :P. I mean, I hear he's a nice guy.. but maybe accordions were just never meant to be played in dreams. It totally works in Lady and the Tramp though.
lol, dreaming of me would just be so much worse than Freddy. 
psh, that just sounds unheard of.  and me? amazing? lol those words don't sound like they're soulmates. . their*. whoops :P
You shouldn't think stuff that you don't have any proof for. Well, maybe not for everything, because some things with no proof might be very real. . Oh, I found the more accurate translation for that song I seem to be pretty obsessed with at the moment :P Maybe it just surprises me how inspiring spanish speakers can be... "And I hear a voice that says without reason You're always changing yourself, don't change anymore And every time I'm just more the same I don't know what to do with myself"
I know! (unless that was sarcasm) :P
I'd trust you on maybe anything but that. Sorry
yeah, I guess so. Maybe the Spanish version is just a whole lot more inspiring? :P. aw, maybe it was just because it lacked a smiley next to it :P
psh, well rhyming isn't everything. Whoa, did you know there's a whole genre of stuff that doesn't rhyme? It's called like.. prose or something. :P  lol :P nah, revenge is silly, although I think you should believe you're amazing :D  . And maybe if I did see something (that's not there), then I wouldn't be as amazing?(not that I am). :P
lol not fair :P That argument doesn't apply to you :P You're awesome.
yay for individualistic beliefs! :D. :/
:P sorry. I must've accidently hit the questionmark key. and shift simultaneousness 
aw, but I thought it was perfectly believable :P. hey Peter?
Do you actually care about me that much? 
:P lol so much that a little smiley face had to make an appearance to show how much?. I dunno :/ I just wish you didn't maybe. sorry, those question mark and shift keys just keep popping out of nowhere :P. sorry for the other stuff too. I don't think it makes much sense. um
Shaved ice sound good :D
No, I don't not care about you :D
I know :/ I'm sorry
maybe, but then again, that could just make it worse :P. maybe it'd be better just to wait for it to get better on it's own :P
that seems to work. temporarily :P. hmm, maybe just bad timing, I dunno 
Explanations tend to clear things up (or make them worse :P) And you're not bothersome, or an awful boyfriend--I feel like I'm actually an awful girlfriend :/ 
I've done a bunch, and more if I were to tell you the thingy. And you didn't say anything bad or do anything wrong, you're awesome :D. It's just me. :P lol sorry for the clicheness of that
:P maybe that too.. And maybe a lot of "you should be with someone better." 
well.. like.. . :P. ah, I dunno. I'd rather wait for it to go away :P. That's what I do with the monster who lives in my closet, and it works fine :D. same with spiders :P
lol :P what if this depressisode is based more on truth?. I'd rather tell you in person, if I did though. I may have hinted at this a bunch before 
:P That's good. I think I've caught a lot of your rare times though
yups :D. I only really remember one distinctly though
It was a long time ago. :P  And it might be for the best that you don't go through with responding :P
oh, not really :P. I'm bad at dropping hints, unless they were unintentional hints. I don't even know what they would be hinting at :P
:P lol That's a pretty awesome metaphorical statement thingy. If I did write a book in your mind, I'd make sure all the chapters started with those awesome fancy lone capital letter :D. letters*
Am I skipping important chapters?
:P ah, I'm sorry for that
It's a bad story though, and silly, like, I think you'd be better off not hearing this one :P . aw :(. what? :( no. but what if the chapters are just more 'depressisode-inducing?'
:( aw, "Done with you?" Sounds like a neglected paperback novel or something. . You're awesome though
:/ And that's why I'm an awful girlfriend. Like, girlfriends should make you feel awesome, right? :D
it's the greater portion of the entire thing? . lol nosepass doesn't have appendages. he's just one big nose :P
aw :D Well, that's because you are amazing :D
Aw (: Well that just made my day a lot brighter, though the sun is stil gone and it's 11:11 :D . I don't understand where the happiness comes from though, but it's good :D
think about the sunshine that i supposedly  bring into your day? :P
:P well, that's just like, exactly what I would say about you if I was good enough with words. ooh, with my left hand :D. (sorry) :P
oh, no not at all :P . no,*
It could though.. (dun dun). :P lol oh, no, nothing like that. the first time I'd ever said it was like, yesterday to you I think
I hope so too. And it may have, just a little, for me. (:  hmm, would a girl be able to tell if a guy liked them? sorry if I asked this before, this may just be one of those unanswerable questions :P
I might :P  Aw, what if you're not trained in the art of like, smile or eye-reading? or what if they can hide it really well?
lol :P the word "tough" reminds me of a bunch of macho people 'grrr'ing. but aw (: . :P . you deserve someone super duper special :D
It's okay, that's definitely not something you should apologize for. :P I should be able to tell better, or believe it more or something. :P aw, I"m not sure I quite fit the bill. but thanks for making me feel that way :P
oh no, it's fine, you probably show it just fine :D maybe I'm the bad one at catching hints. and y'know, I think you're perfect :D. if perfection was a real thing, it'd be you :P
:D!! see, it must be true, then
:P I always used to think that a narcissist was an undercover cop.  (: aw.... i do just.. taking you from someone else would just be wrong. :P 
that you know of... :P. aw, but.. your heart's to amazing for me to have :P sorry, I won't start thing again
:P aw, is that why I've felt this kind of urge to wear a coat even though it's been in the 70s? :P
yess! :D. fireworks show coming from the harding field :D
:P oh, it just stopped
fireworks must be expensive. It's one good thing about living in a college town though :D
I'm gonna go eat that water now :P
it's fine, you're a really nice person :D. I hope so too :D I hope you are, and that you're not all alone in your housie
yay :D that's really really good. not the worried part though. , you don't have'ta be :D
jealousy is mostly silly :P I think like, it could be a false sign sometimes. I don't have all that much expertise though :P  . farewell :D . so long, and goodnight
(: I hope the same for you, and I'll try :P I do trust you bunches. Bye :D
(: okay, cool :D. :P lol trusting me could be bad :P
lol :P it's okay, I think it was an impossible trust fall, lol it was just unfair :P   :D I'd trust you enough to eat your pb&n sandwich though :D. do you really trust me? :/ like, do you feel like I could hurt you?. don't*
lol, well then, I would've eaten it even if you didn't :P
aw :P well maybe I'll think positively and just be like.. "At least you had some cool adventures and stuff :D"  . yeah :D
I know, it's just crazy how much I trust you :P
oh, it's been okay :D I had ice cream. I guess I just wish I'd spent it doing something else. How was yours? 
 lol oh yeah, definitely. Homework sounds so fun right about now. Aw, I have aloe vera still! (not to rub it in or anything). lol "rub it in"
Right on.
:P oh, it's fine. Well, honestly, I was thinking it'd be fun to do something with you. :D 
:D
oh, a little bit. hmm, well maybe i could think up video ideas while I'm with you :P lol you can be my inspiration.
:P
:P oh no, I can't watch it!. I want mine to be all orginial and stuff. originial*
lol like pringles?
ooh, and those sun chip things :D
:d :P
aw, how do you mean? you're not in the way right now :D. or ever
psh, why compare importance when I can do both at the same time? :P
omg, we better take advantage of this rare opportunity! :P. brb :P I gotta go investagte. investigate* . (. (Thank you, spell-check)*
:D yay. it's sunnyish and moderately weathered
:D. let's go! :D. I'll bring the nilla wafers and you bring the nutella :D
yes.. I just gotta find a sleeved shirt to put on:P
:D yay. lol :P I gotta ask my mom first though
:P. hmm, do you by any chance have a red cape?
:D!! omg I have a red blanket too! :D
:P lol.. oh, maybe :P
nope :D
oh, well, she didn't say no :P
well.. :P
:D I can. Well, she said we can hang out in the park :P Want me to me you over in my proto-type get up?
awesome :D. see ya there :P. I'll start walking to the dentist's office :D
yay :D. bye. :D. :P wait, is that elephant, or doorknob?
o.o oh nos, what happened?
oh no, then it says that you like elephant..
lol :P I already liked "Elephante" a long time ago
lol that's really funny :P
lol :P that's like, a foreign film?. oh no, really? :P was it fun?
:P you can't say it wouldn't have mattered! I would've been like.. like this smiley > :'( . lol :P chillness is cool
o.o because you'd be an angel?. :P
aw :D. but aw :(. I better go eat dinner and such :D
I will see you tomorrow :P lol I think I'm gonna ask Gap to bring his camera to school tomorrow, just in case.. . I'm not sure when it would be filmed though :P
aw, letting me go wasn't a good idea the first time :P
oh, I dunno :P
:P oh um, possibly earlier today. And nah, eating is just silly :P. even though it tastes really good :D
:P aw... Is it bad that I liked it a bunch?
oh, it's okay, really :D. And I might maybe think differently
aw, well.. not bad.. just bad in general :P l. like.. I dunno, PDAish? :P sorry... you're so cool! :D
:P maybe both. And you're not a terrible person!! :D I can't believe you would even think such a thing
Aw, well maybe both of those things aren't so terrible at all. . ah, I gotta go, I'm sorry. but um, bye :D. You're fun to be with :D
I'm probably just terrible at picking it up :P You're really really cool :D (if I haven't said it enough). bye :D
(Not accepting that untrueness :P) g'night to you too :D ooh, and have some sweet dreams as well. :D you'll definitely see me tomorrow, hopefully :P
(: It's fine. You're a neat person. :P yeah. Bye :D
:D yum.
:P sorry
aw, what was your wish? :D it was really nice talking to you :D!. I'm glad stuff is making sense. Peter is not confused :P
oh, well those seem more reliable than clocks anyway :P
Yay :D That's good sounding. I'm still curious what your wish was though :P
:P oh wow. In who's opinion?
:P psh, why would you wish for it then? 
o.o Wish I knew what you were talking about specifically :P. but there are only a few gross things that I know of
whoa, so it is what I may or may not be thinking?
ish :P
Would you consider something involving kisses bad? :P
yeah.. :P but only because you used the word gross!
:P lol that's good I s'pose
Huh, no :P unless you consider iCarly as such. but what makes you say that? :P
oh yeah :P Glee. And Degrassi hasn't entered my life for a few months now :P 
:P yeah, so?. :D
yes. :P I still wanna know where you were going with that
oh :P . Doesn't like, everything out in the world tell girls not to trust boys? :P we even learn it in health class.
:P
yeah, I guess not. But y'know, there's always at least one guy that they portray as being all pure and having good intentions :P
:P lol a theory to why I might doubt you? . and your intentions? :P
:P well, noo.. ish :P I do think you're a good person though (:
maybe.. but.. I mostly trust you, and I don't think you'd be up to no good ish :P 
no wait, I'm sure you'd be not up to no good.
:P lol so my improper grammar isn't good enough? :P
:D yay
aw, You're a good guy, I'm sure of it.. (pretty sure :P) sorry. 99.9% sure :D. define things please :P
:P I think that could be pretty close to home
:P love?
:D. aw :(
aw yay :D. (:
lol :P you sound like an organ harvester. sorry, kidding. aw, you have a few pieces right now :D sorry, it's a little broken up :/
aw :/ well some pieces might be permanently gone.. like, a creepy guy whos standing in the shadows? :P
aw :( It sounds so sad when said so bluntly.. you're not just another guy though.. like, there's something about you..
I don't think you could hurt me.. Like, I trust you.. I guess I'm just a little iffy on how you came to like me or something :/ But I think I'm believing it more.. (:
aw (: It sounds so cute. and surreal :P
no, it's fine, It's surprising though :P lol I totally stalked you. 
aw (:! It's like.. (:. :P I've been working on my stalking skillz since
:D oh yeah, I've had special training in camouflage usage.. lol really? :P that's a little crazy. I think that one basketball game was the first one i'd ever been to.
lol :P it was the first one we had attended together . I think I went because I was thinking you'd hopefully be there because I mentioned it :P. or just because you were already planning to go
:P oh, It was most likely just the smiley. That says it all :P. ahh, I really better go, I'm glad I stayed longer though :D
oh, just talking to you :D
lol :P alrighty, bye :D. see ya! :D. Have a good night (:
you were super duper informative :P And maybe I trust you a little too much now.
:P distrust? aw, I don't want to distrust you.. because you're awesome :D. sorry :P not a good reason perhaps
you're welcome :D yay. Bye! ooh, check out what I wrote throughout the day in my head :P. Ello everyone who's watching this today I was thinking that I'd like to be your SCA Secretary Hey I'm not so great at juggling and I can't play ukulele But since when was that required, anyway? I'll try to be the very best, like no one ever was And I think I've got a few skillz that'll help me with my cause.... (Cue listing of skills.). And I'll of course be holding up some props for each line :P
:P lol oh, hopefully :P or some non-votes from those poke haters
:D yay. I'll just hold up a pikachu stuffed animal. if I can find one :P
:P!! lol!! that might be a little too obvious :P but kind of awesome. Was it the XC prize because the judges just knew that every cross country kid loves pokemon? :P
:D!! lol!
whoaaa :D even cooler.
Oh thanks :P I can assure, the rest will be so rhymey and so meaningful, that both students and teachers will hopefully like it--and whoever is running against me will hopefully feel like I'm not just making a big joke out of it (which I'm afraid of doing, especially if their video is serious and sans-entertainment) :P
:P oh yeah, it's fine :D lol I'm pretty sure I'll use the part that said "Vote for me, because I'm dressed like this!" :P. lol. what a terrible platform.
oh yeah :P if only
there's always a place for the non-serious stuff.. (aka facebook). :D okay cool
:D ooh, me either! It'll be cool!
yay :D
(: Thanks for being awesome :P g'night
:P oh um, you're welcome? . (: bye. I'm so excited for filming :D!. the rap :P
oh thanks :P Me either. I hope my student teacher will be there tomorrow to beat box :P. I'm not sure if I'd be able to find a replacement
whoaa!! :P that's a shame :P He sounds cool.. but I'm sure he's off to bigger and better things :D
:D!! that sounds so gifted
Beat boxing sound really cool :P I tried it out and it sounded like something was dying :P . sounds*
aw thanks :P
Bein' secretary takes some orginization I've heard But I can assure you that I'll come to every meeting prepared I've already got my SCA binder at hand  And check this out, an accordian folder for when I'm in a jam.. lol :P nerdy is good, right?. whoa! pun!! :D accordians can jam
ah, if only rules weren't in the way.. "shouldn't be an all-student production". :D yay nerdy. 8)
okay, I gotta go feed my tummy now :P ooh yeah! like orphan rappers?. sorry if that sounded offensive :P. and lol, I know! it's just crazy :P
it's cool :D I'm just as much the um.. instigator? 
yay :D you too. byebye
thanks :P I'll have so much fun rockin' some rhymes. I feel like it's a lot easier to make approximate rhymes with freestyle :P. like, prepared and heard don't even sound that close unless said in a rapper type style :P
lol! :P . hopefully I won't be needing one of those
lol :P oh totally. Lincoln references score huge points with the history teachers :P
oh yeah :P just like my "I'll have this school running smoother than a whale" thought :P
:P lol thanks
You're all creative too though!! :D. hmm, do you think I could inspire a nation? :P. or at least a school?
yay :D. I'd like to be able to do that. I wish I thought of myself as a better candidate for secretary. Like, I don't even know who I'm running against, but I feel like they'd deserve it more :P
maybe :/ I feel like it'd be more beneficial to myself than the school though. like, I should be putting the school first... hmm... lol :P this is like me and relationships
lol really? :P you think I'd be a good, assertive leader?
:D aw (:
oh yeah, I guess you're right :D secretaries seem more behind the scenes.
:P I can stay organized and dedicated, that's for sure. And I'd put the school first?. :P
yay :D. lol :P I can be like.. "And I'll be sure to share the best of my ideas"   And then hold a lightbulb over my head :P
yes :D!. okay, I better go now :P sorry for staying longer
byebye :D you're fun to talk to and a good motivator
lol :P !! ooh, did you?
:P lol whoa rhymey-ness. I bet yours are awesome :D mine have'ta come from the heart though 
aw :D you're inspiring!. I wanna hear some rhymes from you tomorrow :P
ahh no :P can't read it, must beee original and uninfluenced!! :P. sorry :P
lol :P I have a bad habit of subliminally using other peoples work after I've heard it. maybe it's like.. a plagirism bug
lol :P it's fine
I wanna hear them tomorrow for sure :D. I caught a glimpse, and they look pretty amazing :P. I may have to use the word 'ballot' now :P
lol! :P nice
I knew what you meant though :P. bye! :D. g'night
you too :D
so, see any cool doorknobs lately?. o.o or um, elephants?. I hope you're alright and home and eating cookies and stuff :D I'll talk to you later. Apparently, I have a bunch of palmer to read :P
:P Poor timing tends to get even the best of us. Ooh :D Doorknobs are really awesome sometimes. unless they're like hotwired or something, like those ones in Home Alone. But even though are pretty cool if you're not the one getting shocked. :P And that's super duper cool :D! like, even cooler than a jar filled with elephants :P  And thanks :D Have a good night and see ya tomorrow! :D
Oh thanks :D And you were extremely extremely helpful! :D!!!  Oh yeah, It's oddly cold today o.o!
Aw :( sorry for the disappointment :P I hope it turns out well too :P lol. Lots of cut-scenes.  :D doorknobs can be troubling too sometimes. especially like, if you put lotion on right before you try and use one :P Then they're just impossible. Night :D
ooh, I wanted to do the same :D!. Luck :D. Oh, and happy cinco de mayo :D
yay :D. lol green salsa? :P made from some green tomatoes?
:D that'd make more sense
:D awesome!. to the studying part.. I didn't finish my books thingy :P. I only got up to Napoleon. book*
But I totally believe in you. lol :P there's Hitler. And um. stuff.
o.o. oh no.. lol :P not ringing any bells.. ooh, He liked Wagner.
and he was probably Narcissistic 
ah, I better go skim my really condensed book :P. that's like.. super skimmed information :P . :D good luck.
:P lol! Maybe my brain will come through for me this time. Yay :D smiles!
awesome :D That one where your art is down town?. or that one in britain?
awesome :D. I think I'd like to see that sometime :P
I can assure you, That just makes me want to see it more. :D
:P 
:D it looked nice when I saw it that on time.. and painted it must be like, amazing. :P Oh yeah, totally :P I hear some ragers might be taking place at iHop. I don't know anything bout those though. :P  .  But always remember: Just because Lincoln had a neck beard doesn't mean that it is seen as a symbol of honesty. Rather, it may be considered one of homelessness or rebellion. 
:P I trust in your painting skills (: . And AP US skills. :D have fun with it.
aw, well.. have fun when it's done then? :P okay cool :D bye!. I'll see you in spirit :D. Peace out :D
ah, you're right. But time and exams shalt be no obstacle for a friendship that kinders nor in hostilities nor the divide of presincctions. . yeah.. :P
Neither. :P That's me trying to make up something meaningful, when really (as you may have guessed) it means nothing at all. But maybe, just maybe, having attempted to write what I felt in my heart would be sure to count at least twiceover though no meaning lies in the verse? :P 
aw :( If I could choose between an amazing magical marshmallow cloud and your heart, you know I'd choose the latter. :P um. depends on the context though. :P I think i'd rather be stepping on marshmallows that corroded arteries.. (not that your heart has corroded artieries in it though, the word choice just sounded um, attractive :P)
:D psh, who knows. They might just be all squishy and suffocated. . :P ah, we better get to sleep (or studying), or both :D (at the same time!). So, g'night :D and good luck once again.. I believe in the integrity of your bubble-filling hand :d!
:P Then I hope you are ever so lucky? Though it'd really be my lucky stars and maybe your terrible misfortune :P 
aw. Well, as misfortunes normally go, I seem to remember that they only happen if you eat too many Lemony Snickets. 
:P lol The alias does sound an awful lot like a dessert, right? Aw, well if I only knew where/ what time it was.. :P. but that'd be too easy, right?. G'night :D
:P yay. It'll be like a treasure hunt.. :D byebye. And have fun (after it's over, if you don't agree that the exam can be such :P)
bye awesome person (:
:P psh, untrueness. . :D bye
Says the queen of Sheeba :P I'll see you sometime later, so that's not inaccurate.. unless you were planning on leaving the country or something. 
o.o. I'll see ya tomorrow, okay? :P. bye
:D I hope you reappear for at least long enough for me to give you a um.. . are they called fist pounds? :P. it sounds so weird :P
ooh, knuckle touch?. :P. lol. yeah :D! that one. fist bump.
:D yay.
aw :(. :D magic people can reaappear and disappear at will. . anywho, bye :D. again, g'luck :D
:D! luckyness
the rabbits foot and stuff I mean :P
How'd your thingy go? :D
the exam thingy?
:P just well?. Mine went well too. :D
I mean, I could also say that it was pretty crazy and time felt like it was going slowly even though I wish there was more of it. :P And the first question of the exam was really really funny because it was all-easy, but then the rest were interesting.. Like, I was really glad I read that book, because a lot of the "wise guys" weren't in our regular course material. :P As for the essays, I did my bestest, but I sadly didn't finish my last one :P Ever since Mr. Baker told us that one person didn't even finish one of the essays and still got a 5, it's given me a little more confidence that I could at least get a 2 :P . ooh, and the second time we got to tear of the seran-wrap stuff, I was so proud of myself because I figured out that the red line stuff is so that it tears in a straight line :P. And I was surprised that pens write so softly.. I'm worried that the person reading the exam will get frustrated at all my mark-outs though :P. sorry
lol :P yeah. Did you notice the red line thingy too? :P
aw :P that's not cool.. oh nos, sorry for holding you up.. I better let you get down to that mystery location :P. have fun :D
ooh, for the art thingy? :P. like a sort of, last minute entry? :P
:D that's even cool. Shame about the one piece thing though. The world needs more of your art :P lol think they'd ever let you just tape a bunch of paintings together all artistically and claim it's a single piece? :P. cooler*
:P . do you like banana pudding? :P
hmm, I'm not sure :P depends what kind.. instant banana pudding isn't always the bestest. :P. lol actually, I haven't had any kind of banana pudding in forever. so I'm really not sure
yay :D. lol I was looking at this "nilla wafer" box and there's this recipe for banana pudding that I really want to make. But like, I've already eaten all the nillas :P
I know :P like, how am I supposed to make it now?
lol! :D That sounds awesome! . But yeah, maybe that soggy cracker effect isn't what I look for in my pudding :P  . aw, why not? :D It sounds awesome. especially if there are refreshments. ooh, and a dress code :P 
:D! lol well I bet all the artists there will be doodling too. It just seems like the artist thing to do. (not that I would know, 'course :P)  . aw, not so great? . any reason why?
hmm.. maybe if you bring uno? :P
o.o ohhh, is it an old person thingy?. or uno-hater thingy? :P
aw :(. hmm... maybe you could know them? :P
oh, cool :D. ah, I gotta go, sorry :/. good luck and stuffs :D. and have fun :D
and sorry if I interuppted you doodling at all
never mind what? o.o. sorry
oh, I'm not really busy :P 
psh, my parade is gone already :P . I really liked the miracle whip float though.
:P lol wasting my free time? :P . ooh, and yeah. I still didn't believe it was really mayo though :P. aw, did I ever get the chance to wish you a happy cinco de mayo? I forget :P. and mayo is reminding me of it:P
yay :D. that's good.. but yeah, :D! Have a good time
I bet they'll be playing uno there :d!. I wish I could go :(
.... :P. It sounds pretty amazing anyways :D
psst, where is the thingy? :P
ohh like near the ice house? :P
:P ooh, it is.. I think.. I kind of feel like playing uno now :P
ooh, I have some :D
:P ooh! what's it of?
!! That's really cool :D
It is! . I like Winnie the Pooh :D!
... :P because of my like for Pooh bears?
... oh no.. :(
oh.. Well that's cool too :P. Oh, I was just worried he'd be offensively dead or something. But like, being a zombie is cool, right? :D
:P lol!!!. living pooh.. I hope they don't eat brains :P . hmm.. pooh would probably enjoy hunny more :P. lol :P hunny.
lol :P I think they specifically make AP papers paper cut proof. They probably don't want bloodbourne diseases while they're grading
Exactly. :P Well, maybe it wasn't until that one grader got Sickle-cell that they thought about it :P
whoa, just what I was thinking :P. well, I was hoping your thing wouldn't be over yet. so you could still go :D
oh, awesome :D!! It must be a rager. 
:P lol I'm trying out that policy of "appeasement" . psh, why would people leave an art show? :D!. lol :P I bet the paintings stay there to enjoy the fun.
okay, have fun and stuff :D
aw :(. or maybe that smiley isn't really sad?. maybe it was just in the process of making a smile? :D!
And have it be true too? :D
Aw, wait... somethin' wrong, (um..) sparrow song? :P
you're not trouble :D 
:P lol oh, good news.. it got approved. It's really terrible sound and video and editing quality though :P
:P lol it'll be on Tuesday.
pst... are you sure you don't want me at the art thingy? :P I could close my eyes when I pass by yours
Well I like art and stuffs :D. It's cool like seeing all the little paint and pencil and clay lines and stuffs :D. And colors. Those are awesome.. And I really like shapes. . :D
ooh, I was getting to those :P. lol :P is there a dress code exactly?
:P you'll be underage and underdressed?
:D
:D okay 
you too :D
sketch books are nice entertainment :D well, as long as you have a pencil to accompany it.. Or mixed berries
:D lol I'm not sure having a rabbits foot would help in that situation. not that it'd take luck to talk to me
that's what i was thinking :P unless you were just out of foot doners at the time of the operation... yeah :P sorry, don't know what I'm saying. It'd be lucky if I got to talk to you :D!. I'd play uno with you.
And I don't play uno with just anyone :P
totally. :D
:D. yay :D
so you'll be off?. to see the wizard?
:D awesome
o.o. you really had me going. :P. you had me so I couldn't sleep at night? :P. sorry :P I'm bad with lyrics. or I could've just been all.. "put on quite a show.."
:P aw okay.. byebye :D. lol :P I did fine the song though... apparently it's by the kinks :D
es fine :D
bye. oh :P um.
not that last one :P. hmm, was that a yes?
oh, I'm not sure :P
:D oh yay. bye :D
:D . bye.. well, maybe I could make a slight appearance there?
my question?
that's what I'm wondering :P
oh :/ aw.
no, not busy. I just fail at "appeasement" :P
nah, not grounded, but probably close to it.. I dunno :/. i'm sorry
Well.. It's kind of silly :P . or maybe sad, or maybe both
aw, it's fine. I like talking to you :D. oh, nice rose by the way :P. are you gonna "indian give" it
awesome :D
oh :P lol well I wouldn't want to deprive you
should I not read it then? :P
:( aw... . because you sent it? :P
don't worry, I don't have to read it :P . Or maybe it'd be better if I did? 
y'know, since you went to the trouble to send it and make all those spaces and whatnot? :P
:P whoa, that happens to me somethings :P. wait, does your return key really say "return"? :P
awesome :D. !!. whoa. mine says "enter" :P
!! :D. That's kind of crazy. and awesome
:P like, how does it fit all that on there?
:P font size is key.
I hear you learn some stuff about that in graphic design :P I'm sad I missed out on learning about Helvetica :P 
Really? I heard it was one big unit :P . Could've been some exaggeration though
oh, whoops :D Projects sound much funner. Are you guys really gonna start on Government next week? . instead of like, watching some movies or something?
oh, that's a relief :D I couldn't imagine like, not chillaxing after the exam
sighs aren't good signs.. even though they look similar and all
Doesn't matter?!11 if you're sad or something, then it totally matter. That could lead to like.. babies dying or something, somehow. :P. apparently recycling does.
oh, okay. Well, a sigh is still a sigh. no matter how small :P
It's very important :D!
because if you were sad.. then the whole world would just go into a slump
aw :(!! oh no, can it be? does that mean that you italicized_are_italicized sad? . :P sorry, my improv italics didn't work out, so you'll have to use your imagination
ooh! ooh! I have hugs :D!. :P
yeah :D!. aw.. Well I have so many, in fact, that I'd be very interested in donating at least one of them to you :P. in the hopes of your recovery from this terrible illness called sadness
psh, like there's someone like that out there :D. and if there is, they'd be so awesome that they probably don't need hugs :P. or at least not from someone like me :P
no way :P it means very much the opposite
ah, whoops. Maybe I should change the context then? . And nah, it's fine :D finishing AP euro has made me quite content :P
either way, I'd like to talk to you :D
nah :P do you know what is silly though?
oh no, not that :P I was thinking more an astronaut walking on the moon in clown shoes.. or really, anyone in clown shoes :P. especially someone trying to walk through snow.
I know :P. ooh, mimes in clown shoes. it'd be like some hybrid street preformer. we can call it the Pointless. 
:D I get excited about silly things, and here is one of them that I really liked: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ReUKFEgnlB0/TcG3fNb9CpI/AAAAAAAAE6g/-uNlElxi9ms/s1600/bookanouncement2altaltalt.png
yeah :D I really liked it
:P sorry too, I get short term memory a lot
well, unintentionally :P. and maybe not 'a lot', just sometimes when my brain is all distracted with thinking :P
That's good, because maybe they'll get short turn memory and forget I have it :P aw, sorry for being what? awesome? :D. And it's fine, 'less you have somewhere to be; in that case, i wouldn't stop you.]
... o.o Oh, and don't forget the withering. I hear that's important too, though some over look it. :P
just as long as you come back to life as awesome as you are now? :D
.... more cowbell.. sorry :P. I still don't know what "no pogo" means :P
I feel like it's referring to a pogo stick, but i'm not positive :P
only a select few
oh whoops :P sorry about that then
lol :D!! . That's awesome! Wherever did you find that lovely song? :P
:D! it's so nice! I've heard it's a bad courtesy to let friends sleep on the floor while you sleep in a bed though :P  . aw :( what are you sad about, if you don't mind disclosing?
:/ a mess? what made you a mess?. or wait.. when did it start?. sorry
aw :(! how was I not aware of this? was it that exam today?. :/. I'm sorry.. I should've noticed or something
I could pass on the hug through a carrier pigeon :P
aw :/ anything in particular? I mean, school almost over, it should be all happy and stuff :D
oh. Well that's okay, I guess it wouldn't really do me any good to know.. hmm.. would banana pudding help? ooh, with nilla wafers? :P. or ritz crackers?
aw :/ songs are moving sometimes I s'pose.
lol whoa, that song you sent the lyrics too is by that band who did that cover of "I wish"! Sorry.. continue please :D
That is a depressing song
aw, is this about relationships then? :(
well those are just silly, so I wouldn't worry
:/. aw, I wish I did send that carrier pigeon.. I hear they give good hugs. even though they don't have arms :P. or eyelids
like hugs?. I do like hugs... most of the time :D. well, from certain people :P
aw, I like hugs from you especially. even though I shouldn't :P
okay :P lol I'd have trouble resisting otherwise
I do. It's because I like hugging you.
you're a lot to like :D like, not liking you would be crazy.
Whoa, that's kind of crazy. lol oh yeah, I noticed you aren't that great of friends with Edwin.
wait, are you? sorry :P I really don't know. but I think i remember I was talking to him, and then I was meeting you. I think.. maybe.
Awesome :D he likes turtles :D. !. it's so cool.
aw. It sounds so sentimental :D. I'm honestly not that special though :P. And we do go to the same school :D. not to make it seem any less chancy
Chancey sounds like a butler's name
I'd say you're special :D. very special.. And I don't know why you'd be sad :(
Look :D! look with your special eyes! :D. :P
..:(
okay, that's good :D. and hopefully, you never ever will
:/. well that's all behind you now :D. :P
yupyup :D. awesome bomb
oh, yeah, i think so :D
snow-destroyed?
:D! And I still do.. :P 
aw. honestly? I was imagining a picture of a unicorn.. well, not really :P. I don't know what I would've thought you'd be writing :P just secret stuff
whoa. I'd be saying wow to that too :P. It's still pretty much unbelievable
I was really glad my locker was so close to yours :D. sorry. you can continue
and close housies? :P
:P lol. Don't worry, I wasn't thinking that you'd move just for a crush
:D I like it. It's nice to dream and stuff. It does sound pretty chance-y. . What, like.. we're meant to be together? :P. You and I. . :P. lol cheesy. sorry
A-ha.
ohhh, okay :D
That sounds a little less cheesy
That's a good song :P
Skittles.
I'd like to be in your life :D. Maybe I can.. grow you some potatoes? or build you a bike ramp that'll lead you to hollywood stardom?. :P sorry. hmm, how'd you get my phone number back in the day anyway? :P
oh :P whoops. It is on facebook :P. lol it's alright, I liked talkingto you :D even though I didn't know who I was talking to for the first few minutes
noo, it's fine :D lol I liked you too, remember?. so that just made me freak out a little more
Don't worry, everything you did was awesome and I never gave it a second thought :P . Well like, I definitely only think the coolest of you :D
If you did, I hadnt the slightest clue. And I still don't :P
lol sorry, I gotta stick up for my opinions every now and then :P. otherwise I'd just be one of those conformist oatmeals.. Oh quaker oats, whyever did you put a weird old man on your box/tube?
:P maybe they could just put some picture of grain on there and call it quits. or a duck.. but I guess that'd be Quacker oats
oh yeah :P Maybe I'll know that for next year :D They wore pilgrim hats. And lived in pensylvania? :P . you're not a mess :D
:/ i wish i could be more reassuring or something. . but you're really awesome. :D
It's out of trueness more than kindness :D And I've probably said this before, but sometimes the most truest things are unbelievable.. like that thing about dogs having three eyelids o.o
:P . it's alright.. You're unbelievable :P. I used that song in my video I think
the one by EMF
:P it's okay, I still don't. And I didn't even know the band name till I looked up the song :P. they might be a one hit wonder
:P oh,that too. Can they be both?. so what exactly does it stand for?
lol nice :P printers are too though
:P please don't expect too much.. It might be the boringest 3 minutes of your life
:P lol well thanks.. I wish I had made it sound more like a rap though
it's alright, I like songs :D
aw, what are you thinkin' about sayin?
yeah, you'd be saying it :D
:P oh, I'm up for anything. :D. It sounds really fun and what not.. Are you up for it? :D. or down with it?
whoa, really? I won't let this go the Ben Folds way.. if you know what I mean :P
:P you'll find out. some day..
yup :D!
:P lol I totally got that one
sub :P. I think.
o.o I'd be monumentally confused
:P well I can assure you, it will be in due time. I think I found 5 dollars the other day too.. :P. now that you mention it.. maybe.. :P
whoa, sneaky.
aw :D the sock monkey is awesome.
aw :P Were you the person I told about how I really like that one sock monkey in Mr. Magorium's magic emporium? :P
aw, it's fine :D tiny is cute :D
no way, you're to awesome to be a robot :P. would you believe me if I said i was a penguin from the past? <("). wait, why were you sent here? :P
lol an experiment to see how long it takes to get some girl to fall in love with you? :P  psh, I thought robots talking in enunciated voices. talked*
:P psh, robots don't have hearts.
well you have part of one either way :P
:P robots hands aren't tiny enough to type though :D
whoa, I think so.. or that recent one with that one guy in it about mini robots?. well.. I guess they were more aliens :P. just kiddig. kidding*
whoa... that's kind of cool sounding :D I always miss out on the cool meetings :P
is this stuff in your robot training? :P
songwriters seem to have that gift. :D like you. you seem to say stuff pretty perfectly a lot
aw, I'd be sad if you were a robot
because as spongebob put it :P. Robots can't love :P
:D does he learn to love? :P 
yay :D there's hope?. aww
oh no, it's a good aww :P to symbolize the cute ish ness of that movie? :P
:P You're amazing.

:P*
oh, nah
aw, yeah :/ g'luck and stuff though :D. you'll be awesome
:P maybe I could sneak on the bus then? 
lol I'm not sure if they'd allow it either :P
whoa, really? :P spectators?
:D lol well the only other thing i'd have is the cosmos, so I don't see why not :P
that's what I thought too o.o but apparently there a part 2 tomorrow :P
I know :P And yeah, I think. Just to be in some relays though
yeah :D
oh o.o well the cosmos thing shouldn't take too long :P. Whoa o.o. there's something on my wall
oh, it's fine :D . ooh, can I comment on it?
psh, my Saturday was lost to homework anyway. you'd be saving it :P. lol maybe going to lynchburg would be a little crazy though?. yeah, we should get to sleep :D
:P oh well i have to tip it a certain way to hear though the headphone jack.. Well they do both start with "L' so it's understandable :P
:P if only I was allowed to make my own decisions
:P I don't know who you're talking about, but i'd go to see this awesome guy named Peter. ah, i better go eat and then go sleep and stuff  :D
Peter Mattox*
Peter Brett Mattox*
wait..
Bret* with one t? or is it two?. :P. my finger twitched, causing me to hit the key twice. yeahh.. see, happened again with the yeah :P
I would wanted to go :D
what would life be then? :D. lol yes :D
oh. . well it'd be awesome :D
because you don't need some girl to complete you; you're awesome on your own :D
aw :( well, you don't have to. I was just trying to prove how awesome you are :P. sorry
:D
which is really awesome.. I'd like to float :D. in the sea
and you seem like, amazing :D. sorry, is this a song? :P or just coincidental
ohh.. hmm . nah, it's fine :P i'd just feel bad if I didn't get your reference. especially if it was something like that. but we better both get to sleep :D
:P Well you'd be better than that even.. G'night. :D And good luck
I hope you're feeling wayy better (:
:(. aw.. :/. is it the same thing as earlier?
oh yay :D. lol :P. leaving out the most important 3 characers. characters*
Well that's really good :D I wish I knew what exactly it was, but it's good regardless (:
yay :D
Smiles from you are the happiest thing ever (:
nah, you seem like a happy person :D but even if there are a bunch, it's just all.. amazing and stunning and whatnot :P
aw :D lol the vagueness of that makes it awesome. it's very grand :D. I'd say it's piano material :P
that's how grand it is :P. :D
aw, but it's all awesome and stuff :D. vagueness reminds me of marshmallows :P
oh, it's fine :D I think I caught the gist of it perhaps. It definitely sounded really nice (: hopefully :P  (And that's weird.) :D. (: 
And me being different would make me not me? :D I like you and not a different you :D . (but your smile is awesome :D)
(: You're you and just you make my heart happy.  :P (I think it's the opposite of lame, it's un-lame.). :D Good luck
(: you're like.. an awesome bomb.. Sorry, i think your awesomeness just left me completely speechless for a second there ;p. :P(. *. g'night :D
:D Thanks! I hope yours was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! (Wow that word is really difficult to sound out. :P) !!! I wanna tell you about stuff tomorrow so hopefully sleep fixes the deadness stuff. Have a fun Mother's Day even though you're not a mother. :P And the stuff you're typing (or that you were typing) is awesome! I fell asleep to the disney channel a while ago and had the weirdest dream ever about people rolling their r's. :P G'night. You're really cool!
Aw, still got that 'zombie' feeling? :P Did you eat too many um.. brain-shaped food items or something? or maybe just not enough sleep? ooh, or too much? Anywho, I'll talk to you tomorrow :D! Don't forget to turn the lights off in your room before you leave the house :D .. I always forget mine and then end up killing lightbulbs :(
:D psh, zombies have it more fun. Actually, maybe not. They seem pretty oblivious to what their doing most of the time. :P Whoa, that's killer, dude. (pun?) :P !!! would you believe that I haven't changed the lightbulb in my room since we moved in? It's one of those new fangled energy efficient gizmos I think. (knock on wood that it won't go out within the next few minutes of me sending this :P)  Are you well on this Monday afternoon? I would talk more, but I have to go finish spanish homework and then find my laptop charger(it's essential! :P).. Ah, sorry :P read that message I sent-ish. I'll talk to you later (:
By the way, sorry if it sent twice :P. bye for now and have fun :D
Hi :D
yay, beat you to it :P (if my facebook is accurate)
aw, :( that's okay, it wasn't too great :P. I'm not sure, my facebook said you were typing, but I doubt it :P
oh, aw sorry then :P I feel kinda weird for saying that now. It's fine, I should probably be doing my english homework anyway (last essay ever! [Hopefully :P (well, like.. this school year anyway.)]) . aw I hope you're okay.. But I assumed so since your fingers are still working.
aw :( so you're not okay?
aw :(. The only good part of the video was your commentary :P And awesome rolly-chair pushing. And maybe that clock throw.
Oh, just a short line :P but it's still cool!. ah, I feel bad for breaking so many rules on the video. like, making it somewhat 'entertaining'
aw, thanks (:. I hope so
aww :( no, it's fine really. Even if seeing you today would've been awesome, I'd rather you get better and stuffs :D
oh, well it depends what you have.. Like, I'd be completely find with just a cold, but anything with a cough I might be against :P oh, or anything lasting longer than 4 days. Or involving the GI tract
oh :( aw. Well, even then, I'd like to see ya :D
It's worth it both ways :D. And especially worth it when you're at your best
yes :D 
omg!!! I love Up :D. had you never seen it before?
it ends happy though, right? or did you cry at the beginning after the nice couple montage?
aw :( I still can't imagine a guy crying. Especially you.. :P maybe it was just a yawn? 
:D aw, it is :(
I don't like sad old couples who die :(. well.. like.. . you know... like, what happened in that movie
well, I guess they weren't sad until one of them died.
:P lol I think you would hate most Nicholas Sparks books then.  Just for the unnecessary sad plots.. unnecessarily*. I've only read one, but I've heard things..
aw :( yeah. It was mainly a happy movie though, I thought :D. and it's fine
si, si
nah, I'm a terrible procrastinator on school work. I love the smell of the hand soap i used :D. I can't stop sniffing my hands :P
aw :( that bad?
lol :P aw. Would chocolate be easier to smell?
Totally sure :D. lol :P And then I say that I have'ta go :P
o.o That could be a bad sign. And I don't have to have to go :D. sorry for the rehetoricalnessish
:D are you on the bottom of your game then?. just set Monopoly on top of you :P
The box gets all squishy if you sit on it though, so maybe being on top of your game isn't the best :P
! :P oh yeah, I bet that spinner thingy would be quite sharp. sorry, I'm thinking of Life :P
I love the little people you put in the cars :D!. it's sad that you can only have 6 though
yay :D she's one out of 6
nah, just sounds like a mild case of um.. MAHO? :P
I had crocodile leg syndrome today :P
Well, I'd describe it as like.. when your leg feels like a crocodile is gnawing/omnomnoming on it :P
Oh, it's not too bad, I think i ran most of it out :P I hear that running in zig zag lines helps you es-ca-pe :D
or because you're awesome :D
oh yeah, I forgot, you're too awesome to be awesome :P. ah, sorry, I should probably go eat and do homework now :D
I hope you can smell chocolate and other nice things soon :D . yay :D timing
:P I'll can fun too and save it for later, or for some funless person in need :D . have fun too :D. and try not to go near any soccer fields if you do do that :P
:P I knew what you meant. Nobody's perfect :P (sorry to quote a forgotten memory)  And life is awesome!! :D Thanks, bye!. lol I like how you got the middle of the word amazing :D. Imagine if it was sang like "'mazin' Grace" :P
I guess it'd just be missing a silly-bowl
Thanks for being not-dead :P lol I would've said 'un-dead' if that wouldn't've made you a zombie. . Byebye for now :D
o.o Please don't.
.... :P That answer is so self-explanatory that I just won't respond.. Anywho, ttyl :D. bye
you may or may not know this, but there's a pretty cool lightning storm going on out there.. 
:P I think one of my goals in life might be to catch lightning on camera without using one of those high-speed high-tech thingys. . I was thinking that now would be a really good time for that :P
oh it's fine really, I'm like, right next to the window :P. And I need something to do while waiting for the perfect long-lasting lightning of course :P
:P you're not, but you made it sound that way earlier too . ish
lol :P is there a best of ways for that?
I don't really know :P Whatever you were referring to, I s'pose
:P oh it's fine, happens to the best of us. All this Thunder reminds me of a sad song . bye um.. Boys Like Girls :D
:P well, it's just the title of the song, so, y'know.  Do storms remind you of anything? :P
Sounds nice even if you were kidding :P
oh, maybe a little.. I mean, maybe in a different context it could sound nice
like, you know how some people say that they live for music, or like the words of children, or the look in the eyes of the one they love or something?  in a context like that, I wouldn't call it morbid.
aw, well judgeyness shouldn't prevent you from living out your dreams :P. or something like that.
Do I know? :D
Oh, I think I definitely know.. Actually, not really :P I don't even know what category the thing that I'm knowing is in. something about living for something?
What do I know? I know that strawberries taste good unless they're moldy. And I know that life is kind of like.. one big (not box of chocolates :P)..hmm.. Well I guess it's just some place where you can go do whatever you want and be whoever you want and there's a whole bunch of decisions you can make and people and places to know. Yeah. (I guess I don't really *know* what life is though..just some observations :P) And I know that school is ending soon (which makes me really happy :D). And I know that.. hmm.. When I think about it, a lot of the stuff that I know is just what's fact. I feel like I don't know much stuff for sure besides that. 
lol :P yeah. I mean, I guess the definition of a fact is like, something you know for sure anyway. But I wish I knew more than just facts :P
to know the unknowable? :P
yeah :D I guess that's a good reason.. or maybe I live to figure out what I live for :P. I've never really wondered what I live for actually :P It's kind of like.. everything around me that just so worth living for. so I don't wonder
:P food?
food to live, and live for food :D
lol thanks? :P . positive. what was your bad idea?
:P nothing could be a bad idea.... :P
:D but knowing things is good most of the time, right?
:D When you say cliche? 
um.. pick up lines? :P
Aw, I like that notion :D. Would it be silly if I said that some of my biggest inspirations in life (am I too young to have those? :P) come from a TV show?
Well that's good. I was thinking about it, and I think that's what's had one of the biggest impacts on my life :P. Authors too, can be some of the most inspiring people. I think I need to read stuff by this guy named Tennessee Williams. He seems cool. And Tennyson, if they aren't the same person :P
Trust me, there's not much you could say that I would think is lame :P . Saying what's on your mind is the bestest because if you don't, then it's kind of like.. hmm.. . would the phrase "a wasted opportunity" be too cliche?
Oh. Well, I have a short memory span if it helps :P
lol :D I like that one. the word loneliness always reminds me of a lion :D
:D yay
:D ooh, you made a video?!
what kind of something? :P past memories?
Awesome :D I hadn't noticed it was off sync though :P
redoing it just for the idea of having redone it is nice on it's own, so either way would be cool :P
People would definitely miss you as they did today, but if you don't feel well, I think staying home would be the best :D
:P oh really? what about like.. me? And the track team? and your classmates?
...:P I'm sure you have an impact on peoples life when you're gone. or at least occupy some of their thoughts for awhile. you probably make more of an impact when present though :D
Well that means something too, right? :P I mean, a welcome back party for tomorrow might not be the most practical, either. Maybe respected figures get more notoriety and stuff, but I guess they'd be missed more for what they do that makes a difference? So like,  . I think you make a difference, and therefore should be missed? :P
well maybe not if missing you inflicts sadness, but just wondering where you are seems harmless. . :D
Minds are supposedly infinite :P so no worries there
o.o. The way you're saying that, it sounds like you're actually trying to be convincing :P
(which would be silly) :P
Well that's silly. :D
like.. Why not?
Well, say hypothetically that you are just another guy.. and say that everyone out there is just another guy.. like, why would I talk to anyone ever then? or how would I even find out who "not just another people" are :P That'd be the logical type answer. Another (though more cliche and not so real sounding) response might be that you're honestly completely amazing and talking to you is awesome too and you're super different (and most definitely not a loser) :D  
And my brain might be thinking something like: "Those thoughts are just silly and watermelon-eating and you should just believe that you're genuinely worth peoples time :D
ooh, by the way, talking to you can be very entertaining :P. otherwise, I'd probably go talk to like my wall or something instead :P. well, not really.. but you're still cool :P
maybe if it's yours :P. lol :P
nah :P. hmm.. which sounds cooler, ditio or it-oid?
:D yay. anagrams!. :P
It means that you're definitely not an idiot.
or is it just all too true?
Just because you're sick at the moment though, right? I'd say aspects of your personality make you cool. :D I think that's what basically defines coolness in most people.
Or maybe coolness is more talent based, and amazingness is what comes from your personality? :P. or maybe they're synonymous? 
You know how they say that there's someone for everyone?. Well, assuming you do, that's probably because there are a bunch of people out there with a bunch of different mindsets and ideas, so even if you're the weirdest person ever by someone's standards, another person could think you're amazing. :P not that you're the weirdest person ever. But by generalized/idealized American standards as to what an amazing person is like (or maybe just by mine?), I'd say some of your personalities and morals fit pretty well.. lol :P "Shun the non-believer"
lol :P what do I have to do with you being amazing?
lol including me? :P
I'd say you're pretty amazing.. (see above comments) :P
Well that's balderdash :P. Actually :P out of context, you deserve someone like, who matches the caliber of your awesomeness more accurately :D
:P so what you're saying.. is that.. . You're like the awesomest person ever? :D. wait... :P
well I'm thinking that you are
ahh, right now, I'm doing this essay thingy. And like, I feel really bad for slacking off on it because I feel like teachers really enjoy when their students try, and by not trying, I'm then contributing to my teacher's sadness.
:P I didn't mean to say that, but I was afraid that's how it'd come out. not the second part, but the part about me being as awesome as you
:P it's not important, but it is if I make my teacher feel badly by me not trying.. ah, do you think she'd care that much? :P
:P okay, I'll try.. And it's alright.. wait, could you remind me again what your clicheness was? :P
:D lol totally true though, right?. :P. sorry kidding. ish. um. you're cool.
:P does it?. You're amazingly cool :D
Psh, what'd be so great about us two being amazing together :P . actually, it does sound pretty awesome :D
:P. Rawr.
mostly :P but it's mainly in response to this essay. See, it wouldn't be so hard to do it nicely if I hadn't already written a 5th rate rough draft :P
mostly the rawring thing :P
nah, it's fine :P you're more fun. But maybe you should get to sleep to benefit your unsickness thing? . wait.. *mostly to the random thing :P sorry
I like sleeping :D. it's so chill :D
It's like, a chill as a person can be besides unconscious :P. as*
:P lol hey, maybe they should be using those rather than nature sounds on those sleep-aid alarm clocks.. :D ooh Gap. What'd he say?. making sure you're alive? :P
ohh :P lol That makes sense.
That makes sense too :P Why?
lol Gap?
oh.
Oh-ho?. :P. Hi ho?
oh. That makes way more sense then him calling for himself. :P
:P Do I know too?. Who was it?
:P lol That's weird.
aw :P what explains the second time?. to explain the first? :P
oh. Well I think he honestly wanted to know where you'd been :D
nah, it'd be silly to not want to talk to you :D
:P looks like it.. Hmm.. I kinda want to see you right now :D . I need someone to write a letter with :P
:P it's not silly. It's perfectly resonable
You know why, right? :D. :P
oh.. okay.. :P
It's like.. your awesomeness. And you're awesome because you say stuffs. Like that other day, when you were talking about um..the buoyancy of various materials. yeah. I thought that was cool. :D. I'm awfully persuasive, right?
When I say the "other day," I might be stretching it a little bit :P . aw. Well :P your company is awesome even if you sound like a 'dying duck' :P. or look like one.. aw :( poor dying duck.
because you were imagining what a poor dying duck looks like in your head? :( oh no, don't think of it--it's too sad! :P . oh, didn't I do such a good job of explaining it though? I thought I covered all the bases. :P. (kidding) maybe I can find the words in time though? :P
:D yay! are you a good letter writer? . oh wait :P
I'm not sure :P I wasn't sure if you meant me finding words to describe your awesomeness or the me seeing you thing :P
yay :D. lol imagine what 100% milk would be like :P
:P lol well i've had 2% before, but I'm not sure if I could handle that extra 98%.
lol :P I wonder how many farm people do that :P just keep a cow in the kitchen and use it when you need milk :d! It's a brilliant idea. hmm..does milk start out at 100% and slowly decrease as it travels around factories? :P
2% chance of disease? :P
:P lol this is how much milk is leftover after we "tampered" with it. 2 whole percents.. sorry :P. If I were being realistic, I'd say I've always thought it was the amount of fat in the milk, since 1% is supposedly healthier
:D lol whenever someone says that, Patrick (from spongebob)'s laugh immediately starts playing in my head :P
maybe tomorrow :P. or sometime within the week. are you really that good with letters? :D
yay :D I hope you are. I'm kind of sleepy 
aw. I hope you get back in it soon. . and maybe.. sleepyness makes me feel like curling up with a bunch of pillows and watching Jay Leno . I've never really seen Jay Leno before though :P. I just know he has a big chin. would your face feel heavy with that?. maybe it'd be harder to chew because you have to lift more up.
and maybe when he's surprised, his jaw hangs open a little more than others :P. sorry.
you and pillows are very similar, right?
I'm not sure :P I guess it'd depend whether the pillow was goose-down or not
:P that's exactly what I meant
oh. Well it was possibly what I thought at the time when I said that, but I started to think that that might not be the best thing to say :P. or something.. um.. I can't wait until like.. tomorrow :D
:D like Winnie the Pooh. . And mainly because I'll be done with homework by then :P lol yeah, homework is almost my only complaint in my personal life. 
yay :D. friend. :P
Hundered Acre woods friend :D
or is it spelled funny?. oh :P maybe. . I like how the author included that the animals were bad at spelling :P
yay :D. lol totally :P. Dictionaries aren't helpful to bad spellers unfortunately :(
boys are silly. :P
oh, I was talking to you... lol :P . sorry, i'm kidding. for the most part
aw no.. you're not silly.. or not in the way I meant :P. you're the good silly. :D
oh, you're welcome :P
When it has to do with you? :D. you're silly when you say negative things about yourself, but you're good silly when you say funny things, and you make me feel silly :P
o.o That sounds scary.. Moms help I hear :P
was it like, a screamer? 
aw :(. i'm sorry.
oh.. hmm. I feel like a Kangaroo wearing a beret would be awesome.. and a statement about national diversity?. they might have to make ear holes in the hat though
I would've asked what the scary video was about if I didn't get scared so easily. . :P
o.o . whoa.. okay, I'll be sure not to :P
oh yeah, those 'ginger kids" can be really scary, right? . :P sorry, I'm kidding, I just read the description. lol I've never heard you scream :P
:P. You're pretty.
:P . I wish that I had some kool aid right now (:. And I wish I could talk to you or something
Well like, in person :D
yes. But still :P 
:D it'd be awesome. Then we could talk about the um.. you know.. :P because everyone knows you only talk about that in person.
:P aw, well stick with that idea because I'm not sure when you'd find out, since it's not to be discussed in a place like this :P
:P Patients are cool :D. lol Patience for Patients.. ahh, I love fireworks at weird times of night :D. didja hear that one? :P
o.o scary video still getting to you?
don't go anywhere in the dark o.o
and remember, flashlights make you immune. So do stuffed animals and clocking devices.. cloaking* 
aw :(. ooh, stuffed animals are also very good huggers?
awww :(. well, I can stay if you need :D. for um.. moral support?
I'm really scared to close my eyes when I'm washing my face :P. because that's like a few seconds where you can't see what's going on around you in an empty room :P. I'd want to stay just for you :D
should be? :P you being unscared should also be important :D. wait, it is :D
Well I like you
:P just as long as this means that I can talk to you a bunch in the future
yay :D. *boy*friend? :P
you too :D
maybe :P. hmm... do you like flowers? :P
do you have a favorite? :P
ah okay :P they're all good as long as they don't attract vicious bees or smell like rotting pumpkins? :P
yay :D
but that never leads to anything good, right? :P
:D
okay bye :D. good luck. and have fun
you too :P
nice talking to you. remember, ghosts=not real puppies and bunnies=very real :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWDc9oyBj5Q. :D. sorry :P. bye
awww.. it's legs are so short :P. sorry. me too :D . byebye
:D!! it's in puppy form :P lol while I really like cute animal videos :P they beat scaryness any day.. wow* :P somehow my wow turned into while... I must be having weird accents in my head again.. sorry :P bye
G'day :D. for tomorrow. I bet it's daytime in Autralia :P. Australia*
oh yeah :D. Good morning. lol whoops, I got caught up watching cute puppy videos
:P lol are they like, entertaining?
lol :P whoa, there might be a name for that. like scaryyoutubevideoaddiction or something :P. or maybe it's just all those tempting related videos
o.o . I'm glad you're still with us then.. :P
yay :D I hope I'm that lucky too.. bye awesome person. Stay safe and unharmed by imaginary ghosts :P
lol if Beetlejuice scares me, I wonder what the video would do. :P please don't say that.. unless it's casper. I'm so thankful to whoever made that movie :P. "The friendly ghost"
oh yeah :D! as Wendy or something :P Her career debut. Aw, no spiders for me either :P not unless they look like cute little fluffball with smiley faces on them and no legs :P. or pinchers. yeah, well g'night :P sorry for staying longer :P
yay :D byr. bye*
Hi :D!. How've you been doing. I noticed you were a little bit gone from school. Or were you? :P. doing?*
Awesome :D
:P That sounds silly. You'll see me eventually, so no need to miss me for just a day or so. :D  I've been pretty good :D it's really nice outside. And I am (generally) free from homework :D!! . yay.. whoa, the AP English exam was today. I heard some stuff about it, and it sounds scary. O.o
oh, I missed you too :D! I was all like excited at the end of 2nd :D. 2nd period*
it's okay :D it was fun anyway I s'pose. I hope your day was really really nice though :D!. Didja get to do some fun stuff at least? Or maybe first, are you better? :D. like.. un-sick? :P
lol :D That sounds very chillax. :D and the feeling a little better thing is good too. Hopefully you didn't have any weird dreams?
whoa. lol but see, stuffed animals really do help, right? :P
yay :D. I had a weird dream that there was a random guy in a suit at my house :P. he wasn't a lawyer though :P
lol aw :P well It's okay, I guess he was the one who clicked play :D. He didn't look too bad today :P. actually, he looked his usual self, I'm not sure if I know him well enough to say that though :P
so maybe he has occasional recurring fears of something attacking him? :P
:P something like that could scar you for life. Maybe. Actually, I didn't see the video, so I don't know :P I think I've almost gotten over my fear of mirrors in poorly-lit rooms while I'm home alone :P. ah, I gotta go. so I'll ttyl. have a fun rest of the day :D
:D I might go eat some ice cream, too. That stuff is really good :D!! oooh!! And I found the perfect root beer float cup!! :D . (sorry if I'm repetitive in any of this :P)
yeah :D It'll definitely be an upcoming event :P And awesome. bye :D
oh hi :D. nah, it's fine
lol I don't mind that interrupting cow knock knock joke either. :d. :D*
I could be. Right this very moment. hmm.. what color is your tie/bowtie for that random thingy that we might be attending sometime next next week? :P 
:P okay cool. Red sounds neat. Like sitting on top of a rainbow.
like a quadruple rainbow?
oh hey, I found the picture that goes with it too :P sorry, it's a little graphic.. but it's what happens when too many rainbows get together and cause awesomeness! http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S5nkxhOMZxI/AAAAAAAACKI/BdjrZfSrat8/s1600-h/exploding+rainbows.png
oh I forgot to add the (inside some random persons tummy*) part :P. lol actually, I didn't even notice that.. I thought they were attacking her. :P. lol. !! :P
lol but who wouldn't want to get attacked by four rainbows at once? :D!
oh whoops :P I forgot to read it. Apparently she's so awesome, that when she explodes, rainbows come out instead of internal organs :D!. aw, rainbows attacked you? :P did they think you were a put of gold or something?
:D rainbows sounds so friendly and awesome. What about windows? but aw :( does that mean you're upset often?
They can travel though computer screens too, right? :D and the space and time continueum?. continuum* 
:P I'm surprised your room doesn't attract vampires. It seems very light-proof :D And oh yeah, those sprinklers are just crazy. Especially when you shine some rainbow-colored lights on them? 
Yay charlieissocoollike
maybe? :P lol I don't think he talked about that actually.. or did he? (here's my short memory span kicking in)
:D maybe you gave them permission a long time ago when you put that welcome mat outside?. oh no.. maybe I should get rid of mine :P. hmm do you have a welcome mat? :P
lol yeah, that's like an invitation to anyone within 10 feet of the door
:P aw.
Actually, I think mine says "wipe your paws." I'm gonna be like that Jon guy and say: "Yeah, my dog can read :P". lol! Matt the welcome guy? :D
I feel like Butlers are a little bit like that. and those guys who stand outside of hotels. It might very well already be :P sorry, the idea wasn't too original. oh just kidding :P I don't know what I'm saying.. I thought you were talking about something else.. but yeah. Welcome Matt.. good idea. :P sorry. yeah.. I'm gonna go now :P. um.. bye sorry.
maybe he plays good music too :P
it-oid? :P sorry, it's not very catchy. and I'm still curious what you were typing before I went on a tangent :P 
( I still like that cosine joke :P). aw, sorry for yeah.
okay :D . byebye. It sounded all important though. I could tell by the way the little dots looked in place of the normally just plain green dot (props if that made any sense at all in your head)
ah, well okay. If some light goes on, let me know :P ooh, see if you can beat the lamppost outside my house
:P oh I don't know.. I was thinking how like, an imaginary lightbulb goes on over your head when you think of something, and the streetlights go on around this time too.. soo... hmm. sorry :P
oh, well okay then :D I'm all for hearing unimportant stuff though :P. That's basically all I have to talk about anyway :P
.. :P lol maybe indirectly.
oh, thanks :P lol or my indirectly important stuff?
:P I don't think I have any of that actually
oh, I don't think I have anything that I would be doing either :P important or not
oh :P I might not have exactly meant that.. like... hmm.. Have you ever like.. said something kind of awkward to someone when you were passing them in the hall, or done something kind of embarrassing? I do stuff like that a bunch, and whenever I do, I always kind of quickwalk/ run away a little once I pass by. Maybe sort of like fleeing the crime scene? :P That actually happened to me at least once today. But yeah, that was me a few minutes ago too.
lol :D ooh really?
whoa that's cool :D! I wasn't sure if it was a common thing
oh. Aw, well if it were you and a conversation, I'd say you'd be joining rather than interrupting. :D  And I feel like when you'd do things in those categories, no one would really think too much of it besides yourself. :D I feel like it might be like that for a bunch of people (maybe even including myself). Like, most of the things I'd think are pretty um.. "devastating", are just like soon forgotten mostly-normal things to everyone else :P . sorry :P 
maybe that's because they know that you're just too cool for them? :P. or something.
Doesn't that sound like.. really silly though? sorry. 
okay, do you honestly honestly believe that?
oh.. :P lol sorry.. little one word answer.
oh whoops, I was talking about mine :P yours was completely okay.. but thanks too.
*response? :P. or *reply?
I get those words mixed up a bunch
But in *response** to what you said earlier, I'd say it's silly because talking to people is like one of the most fun things in life :D!. if you didn't talk to anyone ever, then life would be like.. non-existent almost. That's why languages are so important and what not.. whatnot*
**To that first part: If you really think that, then you should do it for yourself--like, talking to people is the only way you can learn things and figure stuff out. :D . And that second part is just pure madness. . :P
...!!! :P lol . I wish I knew how to word this.. It doesn't like.. annoy me, annoy me. But it does sort of bother me that you'd think so lowly of yourself or at least mention it so much. Like, it's okay to think you're not good enough, but you shouldn't let it stop you from doing stuff you want and feeling as amazing as you can each and every day :D yeah.
the sky is all white :D
It's fine, really. :D sorry, hold on for a second, i got a call from mi padre 
ah, I'm sorry; that was a teensy bit more than a second. . And at a bad time :P
but yeah, as I was saying. You're awesome. :D. lol :P perfect, perfect? or was that sarcasm?
:D yeah. so... How are ya feeling?
aw :( ooh!!! chickens get cooped up everyday in a coop :P so at least it's not quite that bad. I do hope you recover though :D
:P That could be either really cute, or really disturbing.
:P awwwww like the little puppy trying to get down the stairs?
That sounds really interesting :P I'm wondering what exactly happens in this video though.. ooh Plot synopsis please?. sorry :P it's a funny word.
lol :P I just read that entire thing in my head as a rap.. I think it started right when you said "lemme 'splain'... It just sounded so.. rap-worthy :P
That video sounds pretty interesting though :P. and try me :D
I have, although I'll admit it was ages ago. Did I tell you how I remember jumping over lego boxes while I was watching? :P I was so little, that the lego boxes were actually a challenge to jump over. . how did that one line go again.. . Anybody want a peanut?
:P Or not as much so.. Does I love you, Man mean anything to you? :P
yeah.. :P That Princess Bride line is the majority of what I got out of it.. or a part of the majority :D
Twas quite meaningful :P. I always forget how these movies end though :P. so I miss out on the cheesy type endings
:P depends what sort of movie you watch.. hmm.. . lol :P I'm thinking of disney movies, and only a few seem to break that stereotype.. Lion King not being one of them.. Romance is silly :P
hmm.. in the Hunchback of Notre Dame, doesn't the hero not get the girl?. (I never finished it! o.o)
That's what I hear.. I think it's one of my friend's favorites
I should see the whole thing sometime. :D
:D I love putting my time to good uses.. Oh no, I just remembered that I didn't ever eat that ice cream like I was wanting to. But I s'pose it'll still be there tomorrow. Hopefully. :P. ...Or tonight when I get a peanut butter ice cream craving. :P . I'm not sure if that's happened before, but maybe it's possible :D. sorry
Did you eat through another drywall? :P
o.o! whoa. lol :P And that's why you should always eat desserts when you feel like it. . :D. I'm comfortable with that moral.
Weird. Sugar always seems so innocent :P
ahh, I've never had a real real nightmare before.. just those midgets dressed in gnome outfits with the scissors, but that wasn't too too scary. lol :P it was kind of funny looking back on it.
:D!! I heard it in my head. maybe. :P wait.. maybe I don't see the rhyme :P. But i like it either way :D . They were serial killing gnomes!! And they wanted to like throw the scissors all samuri style and slice me in half or something. very scary.
your terrifying dreams?. what do those consist of? o.o
whoa. That's crazy. :P I can never get myself to nightmare about things like that, though I'm not sure I'd be wanting to have any nightmares, but y'know.. if I had to pick.. I might want werewolves over skydiving gravity defiers or creepy grass shaving blob monsters o.o . I always thought that parachute pants were worn while skydiving :P. Are they? I'm still not sure..
oh. :P lol yeah.. those might not be the most helpful in skydiving then
I've never had a dream like that :( or a dying nightmare.  What do they feel like? o.o
! o.o!
whoa.
I can honestly say that's never ever happened to me. o.o. It sounds sooooo weird!!. I sometimes get those funny feelings where you miss a step in your dream and then you do this kind of awkward twitch move in real life, realize your foot didn't touch ground, and wake up :P
Those are cool :D
whoa :D that sounds fun! . were you like, at a circus or something? Sometimes sea lions balance on balls :D
ouch :P lol must've been even worse than me and that backflip incident.. Aw, you're staying home tomorrow?. What made you decide? 
.... :P. real reason?
oh, it was back in my high jumping days. :P
because I think you might be going over your 2 day limit if you do stay home :P
I'm not too sure :P
I'd miss you bunches :D. !. unless you're really not feeling too well :(
:D yay. for the cereal reference. I love those :P
aw, I'll try not to be. . I'd be super happy if you were in fact there though :D. How is the sicknessness?
:D and the usual is?
.. :P continue...
.. anddd..?. :P. is that a good same ol' or bad same ol'?
I'm not sure :( How bad is bad?
o.o I can't imagine you being all sick either. I hope you didn't catch it from me or anythign.. but I'm glad that you're not dying :P
aw no, I'm sorry if it was
:( I hope you make a recovery within the next 5 hours :D
I hope you come :D. if that's all I can do :P
yay :D
.... well.. there's always friday? :P
..oh no, it's not thatttt bad, is it?. a week-long sickness?
o.o But when? . :P
oh. :P Strep is bad. . whoa.. lol :P I think I had strep once, but I didn't have a cough. my throat just swelled up a bunch.. or um.. my "lymph nodes"
are chicken pox scary? o.o I wonder if I am still susceptible to getting it :P. do you still have your tonsils? :P
As far as I know, I still do. I mean, unless I swallowed them by accident or something :P
yeah.. And I think I may have gotten that pox vac. thingy possibly :P
hmm.. how do you feel right this very moment on a scale from 1-10?. yay :D. for vaccinations
:P oh yeah, isn't that the point of the vaccine? so you can get it over with?
ohhh, so technically, I have had chicken pox :P. in a small unaffecting dosage.. or something.. :P. ohhh sorry, I'm thinking of innoculations.. maybe? :P
ahh I'm so not thinking about what I'm saying.. o.o. whoa.. Maybe all your B-cells and helper-T-cells fell asleep?
Did you bathe in baking soda? :D and wear oven mitts all day? . sorry. hmm, how little were you?
whoa, that sounds rather old for chicken pox :P I can see why your doctor said it was rareish/bad? maybe? sorry, I'm bad with diseases. :/  . lol :P this is a wellness scale, not a pain scale.
Aw.. is it just the sickness making it low?. lol :P are you down with the sickness?. sorry to make fun. When I said I'm bad with diseases, I meant like.. gauging how badly someone feels when their sick or something like that. :(
Awesome :D lol it's crazy how much paper these people have available to send :P
good kindling maybe? :P
lol sorry, I guess it depends on the college. Most I don't believe I've ever heard of though o.o. sadly
:D! I think I've heard of that place too. lol :P Prattfall.
hmm?. :D
Awesome :D didja get in?
psh, so? :P you don't need to with your schools :P. skillz*. sorry, weird typo :P
:P preorders are always nice
:D
yeah :D. possibly.. but you know what's awesomer?
well, not random at all :D. it totally fit . with my um.. heart :P. lol . :D <3. And um.. the awesomer thing might be like.. soup kitchens.. yeah.. those are good :D. for the community and such
:P lol yeah. It's awesome in it's own way. (: A kind of awesomeness that everyone can agree on, similar to rainbows and panda bears (unless they've been mauled by one o.o).  Hmm, can you get mauled by a rainbow? Oh yeah.. you do, don't you? :P
I'm sorry :( It's hard to forget. Your words were just so powerful.
:P lol oh okay.. hmm. Sorry, this is kind of personal, but um, got any plans for the 21st? :P
yeah :P I guess I mean like, dinner/picture/after-afterprom plans. Sorry, just my mother and Patrick have been wondering :P What a weird combination, right?
:P
yeah.. :P. sorry, I dunno
nothing in particular :P lol that one person was suggesting watching the sunrise and I thought an improv water gun fight would be nice, but I'm not sure of the weather.
:P lol the 2nd one would have to be scrapped if changing was not an option. pst... are you positive that you know not of before-prom plans? :P
:P oh, lol It's fine. I guess I just gotta get back to those people.. or *that person. lol this is like a Fat Person problem
I think Patrick. He was inquiring.
:D awesome.. lol I'm surprised you didn't ask about the Fat Person bit :P. unless.. you know? :D!
like, in Ms. Boling's class?
oh yeah :P she called it the "politically incorrect term" for those permutations we've been doing. like.. when two people want to sit beside each other.. "It's like they're a fat person, because they move in one big lump." :P she said something along those lines. And yeah, I have to go places with you in one big lump :D (not that it's a bad thing)
:P That's prom night for ya. Or so I've heard.
lol :P Me either.
:P oh definitely.. well like, the vice versa
It's fine :P Patrick offered up his place for pictures if you'd want, I was thinking you'd want to do something with yo friends though :P. That's why I asked and whatnot 
lol :P ohhhkay. ooh, is Drew going? :D
:P lol I was just wondering because I heard somemone joking on the track bus one day about him asking someone to prom for some reason. :P 
:P sounds cool. lol Glee told me that that term for that is "stag"
:P sounds familiar
oh okay :D. I'll see ya tomorrow maybe :D byebye
aw, well have an amazing day either way :D G'night to you too
:P oh I'll try. I'm a little nervous. Byebye :D
just school :P And it's fine. Ttyl :D stay safe and unsick. !! it's so awesomely rainy! :D. I hope that you're hope by now, or if you're not, that you're having as much fun as possible in the pouring rain :D!!! I love rain when I'm wearing waterproof clothes :P or swimsuits or such.
That sounds fun though :P Why else would people buy super soakers?  :D And okay, g'night :D
:D I dunno, it sounds like a nice life experience. I know that it'd definitely be fun with friends at least :P Lightning is nice when it's not hitting important things :P  Oh yeah, sorry about that. :P hmm. I made a weird cheesecake. But it didn't turn out so well :P lol.  
You were probably just trying to be original without knowing it :P. you don't ever fail. (: ttyl.
lol :P those are two different buses though, right? :P that'd be funny if they just waited there 2 hours or so. :D Guess which bus I'm taking? If you need a ride to the 2nd bus, I would be able to help with that :D See you there if it doesn't rain and thunder a bunch :D. oh no, your status worries me. But there's a smiley next to it, so maybe it's sarcasm? :D
Hi!! :D ah, you're so cool!. sorry :P
:P psh, that's questionable. . :D! cheesecake!. I forgot to add cornstarch though, so I don't know what'll happen now :P
:P but if you've never made one, and I have very little experience, who's to say that yours wouldn't be like, super amazing :D maybe you're a natural cook :P
:P not as spectacular as the fourth of july :D. I can't wait to try it though, I'm gonna like, attack the oven once the timer rings :P
Yes :D!!!!. with a fork.. or spork, whatever's avaliable.
:D!! I'll try. ooh, it just rang, I better go :D!. aw, you're bored?. I have some ideas... hmm..
how open are you to destroying your kitchen? :P 
:P lol I'll go get it :D! I. 'm so excited :D!
and okay :D go have fun with stuffs
I like bubbles :D
Byebye
You too :D The weather isn't so bad :D!
:P there's always something to do :D! especially outside. and thanks, you too :D. byebye
Yay :D! That's very extremely important :D! ooh, I saw a doorknob too. It looked a lot like the doorknob on my front door-in fact, I think it was. :P Shiny doorknobs sound like the product of really awesome metal or excessive polishing :P ooh, or windex.   I hope the rest of your day is really really good too! I had fun talking to you and stuffs. I kind of care about you, like.. a whole lot, so it was good to see you betterish (hopefully) minus the finger thing. :P Sorry. um. Bye! :D
Oh, you're welcome :D I like listening to you anyway. And it's fine. Good luck to you too (: I hear that 28 out of 55 is passing :P 
:D! you were at school today.
We both were :D which would explain how we knew that each other were?. No, listening to you never ever ever gets boring :D!
yay :D. things are explained :D
(:!. aw, I saw you out in the rain walking today too :(
oh, it's okay. It was more fun seeing you dry and whatnot :D!. whoa. Floods are scary.
Well, I'm glad you didn't drown or get cold feet :P And that you didn't have to walk the entire way home.. I was actually hoping to find you :P 
Really really :D Though I was questioning your choice to walk home alone in the rain.
Aw :D wait.. nice walking home in the rain? :P or nice getting Drew's doughnut? . And nah, I was just hoping you weren't all sad :(
Ohh. aw, sorry to offer you that bit then. :P Hopefully it was a different kind of doughnut? . wait, you were sad :(. ?*. it wasn't the same thing was it?. because you're not a jerk. Even if I did hear people singing that song today :P
lol he sounded like he didn't want you to when he was recalling it. :P But you're definitely not a bother. And you're still not a jerk. :D
Oh no, it is the song? :P I'm sorry. And maybe I was really just calling my mom over and over and clutching a bag with a doughnut in it in hopes of splitting it with you. :D. aw wait, what's bothersome? sorry
so..not just the song? :P sorry. And that's weird. You seem like the most-un-jerkiest person ever.   Me, busy? :P aw, I didn't see you till the end of the school day. But trust me, I'm never too "busy" to talk to you. :P unless someone's having a heart attack.. You're just thinking silly thoughts :D (no offense, of course, just my opinion based on what I've heard :P)
lol funny thing is that I was actually looking for you during a few of the "busy conversations" :P primarily just that one with Tim and Patrick and Leyla and them bout Promanade. oh nos, who says you're not important enough? because you're only ever not important when you make it that way. but even then, you'd still be important somehow because you're you. :D yeah.
:P If that wasn't rhetorical, I'd say you're easily one of the most important people in my life. And who else would I want to take up my time than someone I'm pretty much in like with? :D
:P lol answering my rhetorical question too? Well, if you were in like with someone, wouldn't you want to spend like most every second (or at least as much time as possible) with them? :D
Well, I'd say that you're that someone for me.. And it's fine :D
oh yeah, it's fine, I just want ya to know.. And even if you deny, you know that you still know deep down inside :P I think. Hopefully.. deny..it*?. :P
but somehow, you do :D
Yay :D. I like you.
For some reason, I just really wanted to hug you today. :P Sorry.. Maybe just pretend I didn't say that.               Are you sure you've never been to the cheesecake factory?
:P not even in your dreams? 
Whoa. crazy. The name is deceiving though, really there's only one or 2 counters with bunches of cheesecakes in them :P. display counters*
Awesome :D! Yeah, they seem to have them in bigger cities.. The closest one is in Richmond :P. Ooh, New York sounds fun :D
Not if it's the BEST CHEESECAKE EVER. :P lol just kidding, I actually can't remember it, so maybe it wasn't alllll thatttt amazing. Most cakes are pretty awesome to me though :D
yum?
:D!!! Yum! Was it from a grocery store near you? Sounds pretty amazing.
:P I wouldn't be willing to make a bet that big unless the goodness of the cheesecake was based purely on thoughtfulness? :P. no question mark* sorry :P I said it like a question in my head and got confused
:P now I'm just worried that it won't be as awesome as it was 2 days ago. But trust me, it's still sitting there in my fridge :P
lol :P do you laugh in the face of food poisoning?. It's okay though, I've taste tested all of them beforehand :P
o.o I've never had it before.. I feel like it'd be the scariest thing ever.
o.o like I said, scariest thing ever.
Did you know that Sprite uses artificial preservatives? :P
oh totally :D. Did the game "Head's down, 7 up" come from the soda? :P
I always thought it'd be fun to drink it while playing :D. ah, I think I'm gonna get to sleep or something :D . I hope that you're not sad :(. because that'd be sad :(
:P lol I don't know what the first one is, so I'm gonna go with corsage.
:P when in doubt, pick the thing that sounds familiar.. That's a technique that I used for that SOL today :P. hmm.. Well they normally match the dress/overall color scheme, so I'd say some red flower with silver or white ribbon? :P. I feel like an interior designer now
:P lol! it's like that Glee episode! aw, can I know for sure?
It's very important.. :D
:D yay. I like happy. And you :D and them together. . G'night :D see you tomorrow for sure.
:D bye
:D
:D yay. I like those.. ooh, i found that quote from Glee about corsages :P
(: yay. G'night then :D
:D! I like rhymes along with random smileys. Should I say something about memes? :P It's the only other rhyming word I can think of
(:! You're so cool! I'd say I'm a little out of your league though :P (in the downward direction)  Byebye :D
:P you're in your own really really high league :D bye!. :P
lol It's fine, I really don't think you're a jerk at all :P I just sorry I didn't exactly succeed at making you happier than you were. In fact, I think I actually may have made it a lot worse. But I hope you're okay and whatnot :D I'm off to clean my room :P 
Aw, what? No, you didn't do anything wrong at all, trust me. :P It was a fun short walk. Plus, an excuse to completely invade your personal space? :P   Trust me, no sweat. I'm just glad you made it home safe and everything. And sorry I kind of left immediately after I sent that last message, the battery kind of died very immediately :P
Honestly, the last thing I want is for you to feel bad about stuffs.. I shouldn't've been so clingy/pushy (do those go together? :P). I probably should've just let you walk, but I didn't want you to be all alone or sad or anything. :/ hmm. I'm not sure what I should've done instead. :P. Hi :D!. aw, this is very bad timing since I'd really like to talk to you, but instead, I have'ta go "clean _all_ the things." :P ooh, and laundry.. But first, I have'ta ask you for a favor..
Well, you know Saturday? :P. like, with the meet and all?
Well like, my mom wouldn't exactly be able to pick me up after it due to conflicting time schedules, so I was hoping that maybe we could do a carpool thingy and I could take you to the bus at the high school in the morning, and hopefully you could give me a ride home? :P. sorry
Oh, yay :D I hope it does, but don't worry if you're not able
:P oh it's fine, my mom said she'd like to. And you're on the way.. yeah, otherwise it wouldn't be a carpool! :D
covered in what? :P insurance?
oh, well there's not sense in two cars making that 10 minute trip :P And okay :D let me know if you can. Oh, and sorry, looks like the Kabuki thing worked out :P I was kind of hoping it was booked just for you (I mean, I guess I could've pretended, but I would've felt bad). Hopefully your taste for flaming onions will have changed in the past few months/year? :P. booked, just*. commas mean everything
:P okay, okay. It'll be fun :D! bye for now Peter (: You're so cool!
:P Well then, you're awesomer :D. case closed..  (:. byebye
:D!
hi :D
I'm really reeally really really good :D. I gotta wake up early tomorrow to take the bus though :P
:D lol I hope my bus driver still remembers me. And okay cool :D!
Oh. Whoops. :P Well maybe I mostly just didn't want you to sit at some picnic table somewhere and be sad. Not that I thought you would :P sorry, I probably shouldn't treat you any differently you having told me that, but I still wouldn't want that to happen. :( But for future reference, I better just let you walk if you like :P. aw, g'night :D!
Aw, Well, you definitely don't bother me, as you might know. :P Oh yeah, I'm sorry about that. :/ I guess I just had to get home quickly and was a little flustered(this word reminds me of tornadoes :P). I'm sorry 'bout that and for wasting so much of your time. . um, a sadish aw? :P. possibly wistful?
because it's time that I won't be spending talking to you? :P (lol yeah, cheesy, but that's the main premise behind it)
Oh, no, everything's pretty fine :D  :P psh, sleepwalking doesn't sound too bad besides not knowing what I'm saying to people :P You better get to sleep too, district runner. :D Good luck tomorrow! Hopefully I'll be able to tell you that at school too.
I'll try to make sure I see you :P  That's pretty awesome. :D I love new experiences.. Tell me how it goes :d. :D*. /what it's like?
you too :D And it's not 2012 yet :P g'night :D! you're super duper lucky, though it doesn't take much to talk to me
:P whoa!! it all adds up!. because may is 05. And two 2's plus a 1 makes 5!!. o.o. oh no!
It's okay though, we can make it last :D
:P if our lives are in fact, ending? :P
How is Ike short of Eisenhower? :P
:P That sounds like a good explaination.. :D. With that, I'll let you get off to bed :D. g'night :D
:P Well i guess you could always sleep on the bus.. or just run well without sleep :D see ya tomorrow  and bye :D
Whoa, you have work? :P lol sorry. and okay :D byebye
whoa, you have *homework? :P. lol okay, bye
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up tomorrow at 7:25ish-7:30, okay? :P. a.m.* 
Wait, There's a second bus? :P. Lol Yay, i see. Make that two hours later then.. Sorry bout that
:P lol yeah, I'm a bad reader, but I like sleeping in later than 7, so that's good :D g'night
:P but it's okay, because I'll get to see you all day tomorrow. :D lol. yay 
:P I'm not tired of you yet, you're a pretty awesome person. (: But G'night to you too. And I'll definitely see you tomorrow, even if you demonstrate those :P
I'm pretty glad you failed too :D Aw man, klondike bars? That's sounds like a party! :D But yeah, I guess I did have a whole lot of ice cream anyway. Ooh, it was way more fun than I was expecting! :D We did stuff.. hi hi :D. (:
I'm really good but I think I'm about to go into a root beer float coma. :P It made me kinda sleepy.
(: noo, it's never enough.. Oh nos, I'm sorry about Sunday though, it appears that your parents were in fact, quite clueless as to your whereabouts
oh :( aw. I'm really sorry.
:(. aw.. punishment?. I accept full responsibility
No :P If I hadn't like sleepy, you might've been able to leave much earlier. been all like* :P
No way, you were just an innocent bystandard
oh no, she's not upset or anything, just probably concernedish?. aw :( the punishment isn't too bad is it?
O.o what? :P
no, it's okay, really. My mom was actually saying that I was the one who's the bad influence :P I got you in trouble..
No, I'm fine, I just gotta check my voicemail :P. And it'd be better if you didn't disappear :D
:P lol you know what I said.. Wait, if I said that.. then what did you tell me back?
aw :9. :(*. lol :P The first one looks like some guy at a party.. or a polar bear
Aw (: yay.. (:. ah, I'm all smiley now.
I wish I had mustered up the courage to say it more in person :P
:P lol did I say it in my sleep?
I'll never know :p
sorry for what?. :D. Bein' amazin'?
nah, that's way too fun to be soory for :D. sorry*. I keep trying to remember stuff from Sunday and I mostly just remember me calling you warm :P
lol did I say that?
:P I don't remember that
hehe :P still don't know what you're talking about
It sounds pretty true :P. from what I remember. aw, but now stuffed animals just aren't good enough :P. sorry
Aw :( I'm sorry I couldn't be there. At least there was ice cream? And the rain held out :D That wasn't part of the punishment, was it? :/. :P lol I guess you're right. I just wish my memory was better than
Yeah, my dream and you all just blurred together :P 
aw (: It's okay, it sounds a little impractical. Thank you so so much for Sunday though :P It must've been really boring just lying there with a crazy half-asleep person.
For not disappearing? :P lol, you like crazy half-asleep people?
Well, I'm glad that didn't happen, but it'd have been the bestest dream ever. I can't normally dream up nice stuff like that :P just people with Pablo shirts.  And that's good that you were sleepy too :P I'm not sure if you could've tolerated me otherwise.  :P lol like the awesome ocean thingy?
aw (: yay. I really care about you too. :P oh no. What else did I say while incapacitated? 
lol oh nos, what is my subconscious telling you? :P
Oh my goodness :D Thank you so so so so so much for walking me home and spending time with me and stuff (: It's really silly, but I can't stop thinking about how awesome you are. It's just like, a constant thought: I'm so lucky. (:  I hope to see that Disaster Date soon :D and I was surprisingly, not watching Glee! :P You were basically right though, because I would've if I hadn't fallen asleep. You're sooo cool :D G'night and have some dreams that are as cool as you (: 
Ooh, good luck with the brownies- i wish i could help :D
They'll probably be amazing! :D I've never had one of your brownies, but they should be cool because you're so cool. (:
Well i'd still think you're awesome regardless of how good your brownies are :D
Yum (: brownies sound good right about now :D
Aw, thanks :D just knowing that means a lot to me :P
i'd most definitely still want one! :D Ooh, something cool happens tonight!
Doctor who? Right? :P
Aw my phone only shows the first part of the message, but i hope it does play in america :D
I wish i was good at inferring stuff. :P well, i really really like you :D
An hour and a half? :D when i get home, i'm gonna read these facebook messages :P
aw :D! I read those earlier messages, (I think from Wednesday). And they were pretty amazing. I agree with the spider thingy and whatnot-They're just all scary. :P Maybe I can hopefully change my opinion of them eventually. And thank you for walking me home when you don't have to, it's really really nice of you. (:  I hope you got to see Doctor Who and everything :D! And that the brownies went well and that the Mountains of Misery thing is amazing.  I luckily, did not run (there were some scares there for a few minutes when I was told I would have to) and the team got 2nd in their heat. :D  Hopefully I'll get to see you sometime this weekend, because you're pretty awesome! But have fun with stuff that you're doing too! 
:D!
Howdy.. :P
It's going really really well :D! I have some cereal. How is it over there?
Whoa, what a coincidence :P You like cereal too?
Oh :D That's a good song. Even if it's corny :P   Aw, that's sad about the Doctor Who. If you weren't too against it, you'd be welcome to watch it over here whenever. And I bet your brownies are like, more than fantastic. . That's pretty amazing! :D
psstt.. what kind of cereal was it?
!. They're grrreat!
hmm.. i think we have some practice today.
Aw :( I would take you if my mom knew about it :P I was thinking about telling her soon..
I'd want to :D!. It'd be like an adventure!
:P Wait no, the finding you at your house would be an adventure! :D
It would be sooo cool :D!
Because. You'd be all like.. there.. at your house... And I'd be all like.. there.. in your driveway?. :P. ooh, would you let me if I drive?. :P. (I've never driven on a road before)
it doesn't look to busy today though. :P. I'd just be stalling a whole bunch and maybe swerving
yay :D. brb, I gotta go get some stuffs
okay back.. :D oh, my mom said that practice is optional anyway :P
I don't think so, my mom doesn't approve of the conditions outside + running. :P I was mostly just wanting to see the peoples there
Well that's silly :P. We should do something :D
yay :D
would you want?
:P Ooh, I happen to know that the pool opens at 12:00 ish. 
si, si.. lol :P
Ooh, I'd totally want you over here! :P. :P lol I'm terrible at swimming.. I can barely stay afloat :P 
Yay :D that'd totally work. Two drowning people together would be like.. pretty awesome :P but there's normally ping pong and basketball and volleyball too if drowning is too scary for you :P 
yay :D
aw :(
well, you could always come over :D Or I could go get you with my awesome driving skillz :D. walking is for people with legs :P
oh.. :P
It'd be so neat :D along with brownies? . aw, Well, you could come to that too :P . because once you're over here, I could just give you a ride

but wait... it's always right now :P
oh no, what does that mean? :P
o.o . does it?
I like your opinion more :P
lol nice profile picture :P
I'm not sure what my opinion is either :P. I think I'd like to do something cool with you :D

Me too. Sleep tight!
Hi there!
It appears to be getting progressively worse before it will get better!. It's going well!. How are you doing?
7pm it will be!. I'm sorry you're feeling lonely :( In need of a phone call?
Not a problem!
:P Haha, yup! I've got  it in multiple bags.
That'd be nice, but I won't be doing that until I've gathered up all the things!. Perhaps I'll need an additional day...
Thank you!
Do you have an apple and banana for the smoothie?
Great! Do you have a leafy vegetable?. Or avacado?
That's perfect!. Protein powder? (or peanut butter)?
I'll bring a scoop of the one at my house!
I can take a hint...!
I think so.
That raccoon is so motivating!
Still going well! It's been a bit overshadowed by the violin.
Oh I'm coming over at 7pm still!
I'll be sure to be ready too!
Just be yourself 9:. (:
See you soon!
Thank yoU! Neat video!
Thank you!. (hug)
No, this is a great start!
Thank you!
You gave me good luck, which will surely come in handy!. Would you like to come over and list stuff on eBay with me tomorrow?
List your stuff.. I will be listing mine!
You can list on my account if you need. How long is the restriction in place?. How does 9:00am sound?
Awesome!. Let me know when you are on the way.
hehe! :P See you soon!
(hug)
Hmm.. what is a good recipe for Twe and I to bake?
Hmm.... Not tomorrow, I don't think. We haven't planned yet, though.
http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelysanders/easy-one-bowl-baking-desserts#.bg0M8B8Y0. Zucchini bread sounds awesome!. Can we please make some of these?
Now deer can also swarm us when we visit Japan!
Exactly!
Good morning!
I slept well!!
How did you sleep?
Hooray!
I was going to leave around 10:30am after I eat breakfast!. Would you like to come, and/or eat breakfast with me?
Cool! Meet me at 10:15!
That's alright , I'll drive!
Only if you'd like to join me for breakfast!
Okay! I'll pick you up at 10:30am then?
I'm safe! I'm not sure yet where my phone is...!
Thank you!
Awesome! Thank you for finding it!!. I don't need it urgently! Could you please let me know if someone texts me (not an email notification)?
Oh, who from?
Oh :P. hehe. Thank you again!
Good morning!. What a cool video! Thanks for sharing!. Hi, would you mind checking your exam schedule to see when your last one is for the fall semester?. I'm thinking that we should start booking early!
Okay, thanks!. How many Gamecube controllers do you have?
No, I am just making sure you have enough before I sell these Gamestop ones!
Got it!. How is your morning? What are you doing?
That's good!. And is that question rhetorical? It's hard to tell over Facebook.
Oh! Well... I think it should be anything that will get you more experience! Since you will be interviewing all this fall and spring!. It might be helpful to review some of the job listings you're interested in to see what you can do to be a better candidate for them!. Or just persue one of the projects you're working on!. Get something ready for posting/publishing to the web.
The second way is probably best, because interviewers will know whether you are passionate or whether you are just after the job~. !! And I know I'm excited to see a new one of your animations!
Would that be the same as making a layer in photoshop over the previous layer?
You can do a trial version of TV paint, and if you like it, I can buy it for you!
Don't let not having the right tools hold you back!
http://www.animationcareerreview.com/articles/top-20-most-essential-software-artists-and-designers. You've probably looked through all these. But TV Paint is not on there, so I'm sure there are alternatives!. Pixar has a free software called RenderMan~
Yes, its a plugin for 3DS, Maya, and other programs, it looks like. Are you looking for 2D or 3D?
anime studio pro is inexpensive!. Only $111, and they have a demo you can test out.. Sorry, 151 for Mac. http://www.amazon.com/Anime-Studio-Debut-10-Download/dp/B00IUSWBBU/ref=pd_sim_366_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KY4GKJDC821MVAZRBPC. This one's only $25!
Adobe Flash, After Effects and Photoshop all have animation capabilities (you probably already know).
Awesome! ^-^. I tried to find which 2d software the Cal Arts Character animation program uses, but I had no luck.
(: And you can get back to your animation camp!
Want to come over sometime and watch Inside Out?
Great!
How does 7pm sound?
Great! I'll see you here!
See you then!. (:
I'll wait for you!!!. (hug)
You get a big hug!
That's when my Mum left for tutoring!
Okay! See you soon!. (: !!. Maybe those tomatoes in your fridge... if they are still around!
the torch!
Hi!!!
Is your invitation still extended?
That sounds delicious!. Is it delicious?
Whatever you recommend!
I can eat the sauce with veggies! (:
Go for it, then!
Then don't bother with it!
I would still like to come!. When is a good time?
I'm available now!
Awesome! On the way now.
Hi! I love you!
Okay (: You too!!
It goes well!. I am slightly off schedule, but I think I will finish in time!. How is your day?
Awesome!! Which ones?
Awesome!. Glad you were able to get all the materials!!. Keep me updated ^-^
What position is she going to be in?
What does "flat" mean? I thought it would be a 3d figure!
Oh, I get it!
It's going well!. How about yourself? Progress report on the plastercine!
Oh, I see...!
Yes! What was it before?
Wow!!
Oh good!. I've got to go! Ttfn.. Or not.. since I can take Facebook with me O.o. Wait.. so can text messages!. Any way... bye!
I'm still doing well!. How are you?
I'm sorry. What happened?
Is the Plasticine cooperating?
You've got this!
Yes
Of course!
Playing tennis is fun!
I think I will hold off until tomorrow morning, though!
Surprise me!
It all sounds nice!
What should I tell you?
I want you to invite me to do something with you. :3
Sure!
That game is scary!
That's okay. I don't have any bad experiences playing!. It just seems scary to have people running at your arms trying to break through!
Do you remember playing?
Sorry, I'm actually not very interested in making an angel food cake!
Did you have any other activities in mind?
Well thank you for trying!
It would be my pleasure!
No, I just need to be invited (like a vampire!).
Would you like to come over for dinner at 7:30pm? We are having porkchops.. *at my house
Great! I will see you then. You can park in my driveway!. Thank you for coming for dinner! It was so nice having you ^-^

Maybe you can show me the ropes if we ever play!
I am good (: How are you?
I am in La Serena. It is nice! The best part is practicing my Spanish and learning!. I rode a horse on the beach on the first day! And tomorrow we are going to Tololo Observatory on the mountain!

What did you do? I am saving hugs for you!
I can't wait!!. Friday the 29th?. 28th*
Awesome!!
I have class, but you can come as early as you want that day, unless I find a different ride to Blacksburg!
You are neither of those!. I prefer you, but also not because I wouldn't want you to drive alone.
Maybe so...!
Okay! I will take a look maybe (:. I'm going to get to sleep now!. Well, in a bit!

I love you so so so so much too!!. I was thinking about you too!. I was thinking about how the Rotunda sing is tomorrow and I was hoping to invite you, but I want to see if there is somewhere for you to stay, first!. I am worried that I might not be able to get back to Blacksburg this weekend due to a Sunday lunch event.. How does camping sound? :P
Nice!
Want to come over on Wednesday for Rotunda Sing and then camping and Thursday fun!
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7921765?checkin=08%2F26%2F2015&checkout=08%2F30%2F2015&guests=2&s=3I3f
Really, really?!!. (:. And you can hear the wonders of Rotunda Sing!. Have you ever heard of Nasim Pedrad?
She is doing comedy on Thursday night, if you are interested in that too. But if not, we will have plenty of camping fun to do!
You would be arriving Wednesday, and staying until Sunday morning!. Or it can be shorter too, if you like!. Oh no, I forgot to mention the part where I have a cold and would probably give it to you if you came :(
My last class ends at 4:45pm!. Oh wait, did you read the part about me being contagious?
Oh no :P I don't think I have room for it here!. Would you mind picking up some things from my house?. Oh, are you able to come for sure?. With the tent and sleeping bags?
Okay!. List of things to bring?. Unfortunately, I have class from 10am to 5pm on Friday, so we will only have the morning and evening for camping that day! But Thursday and Saturday a quite free!. The site is about 25 minutes away from the Valley Road house, so not too far...!
Aww, baby sized?. That sounds cute!
From my house, I will need my swimsuit, my sandals, a blue bag of things I had been saving to take with me to Charlottesville, and another pair of shorts!  Oh, and sleeping bags!. And contact solution (multipurpose) and toothpaste from the bathroom. :P
Oh.. and my black and white water shoes!. And the charcoal on the front porch just in case we want to cook.. And for you to bring is.... Water shoes, camping clothes, and the tent and sleeping bag pad, a lantern, a lighter, a frisbee (maybe the one in my room?), and any activities you want to do while you are here!
Also, a towel and any toiletries you need?. Oh, yes! Good idea! I will call her now!
She is at tutoring or grocery shopping, I think, but you could probably stop by when she gets home!. I sent her a message!
Hmm, have any fishing nets?. :P. We can catch crayfish and eat them!. :P. Wow! I contacted the host and they will have canoes ready for us!. *a canoe for us to use. Now we just have to decide which camping food we want to eat!!! (: I'm so excited!!. I'll try and get ahead on my school work tonight and tomorrow!. This is super cool!!. (:. Also, please bring aluminum foil and some sort of pokey looking cooking utensil! :P. I have paper plates and plastic utensils and napkins!
Shes ready!
Cool, thank you!
No, I think that is all!. (:. Oh, and my sunscreen!
!!. And frisbee! :P
My blue ones, but my mum couldn't find them!
You can bring your own, unless you need one!. Oh, bug spray is a good idea!. My mom packed the rest of the things together!. I just need sunscreen and bugspray in addition!. Thank you!
Hehe :P Don't worry about the fishing pole!. Thank you!
Sweet dreams!!. I love you so so so so much!!
You didn't!! My roommate was just approaching.. Good morning! 
Oh, we are checking in at 10:30pm--that is just a general overview of the booking!. You don't need to confirm anything, it's just so you have the info!. (:. Good morning!. Sorry to confuse you!. Oh! Also don't forget to bring a pillow!. You can also bring any camping foods from you house :P
That's sounds good!. (:. I can't wait to see you!!. You can park at the Stadium near Rice when you arrive at 5pm. There is an event going on in Darden Court with ice cream!
Be right back, I'm going to shower!
Sure!. The one on Barracks? It's actually not an official Apple store, but they do sell Apple things!
Really really!. I'll talk to you after my next class!. Ttfn (:
In Chile?. It's just water and then the pink-red drink is fresh strawberry juice!
It was super delicious awesomeness!
Whoops, I just had a crazy spider encounter O.o. It was a thick as a baby crab. And fuzzy.
And he wanted to eat my labtop
laptop*
I have been saved ^-^
I do! Especially when we go camping!
That sounds like a good idea!!
Wow, painting!!?!!!. Oh, please bring a bandaid : 3
Awesome!
Oh right!! Please bring 3 reusable water bottles, if possible!
What is a good name for an ice cream store?
That sounds great :P
That sounds good!!
Wow!! So crafty!. I am starting an ice cream company online!. That ice cream bear can be my logo :P
I will make my own image of a polar bear ice cream!
And ice cream polar bear!
An*. Yum.. For visualizing the ice cream?

Is "they", everyone?. I've never heard of that movie!
Oh wow! Lot's of persons!. Sweet dreams to you (:
Hehe, I didn't even notice earlier! If I had staged the question differently, you might have responded otherwise!
I know you do!! (:
I saw it in the email I got! I'll pass it on and see what you think.
??
How about bleach?
Maybe spot cleaning will keep the front safe!!. Ttfn (:
Deadly pink splotches!
https://www.facebook.com/groups/941573849237410/permalink/941957739199021/. Whoops, creepy photo.
The link from earlier works!. And that link will only work once you have access to the PennApps group!. It was just to show you that they said on July 30th that the bus would go from Tech to UVA to PennApps
Awesome! It is the one for $110 right?
Awesome!
There is a Capital One 360 free atm in 7-11 on Tyler Avenue.. You should be able to deposit cash there, I think!
What have you tried so far?. I'll let you get to class though!
Bye for now!
No problem!. I am doing well!. A bit behind on homework, but I am going to work intensely for the next two hours!
Our working vibes will combine to make a fearsome force!
No, that's dubstep!. Anyway, to the works!
I love you!!

Changes abound...!
:P It can just be retro.
Have an awesome rest of your day (:
I will be a bit busy until 4:45pm, but feel free to reach out : 3. I just might be slow to reply!
Hi there!
No worries!! 
Not yet! I am going to b on the bus!. To on*
I am printing the forms! . And bus ticket?
I think I will show that digitally.
You can load it on your laptop!!
And nope, just the recommended list!
In an email?
I just forwarded it to your Radford email!. Don't forget the waiver!. ( just to save time)
I can print forms for you tomorrow morning!
Okay!
You can bring swimming trunks@. !*. (not sure if that sent already)
Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding what you mean by that...!. Won't wear swimming trunks?
Oh, I see! I just meant that since you mentioned you didn't want to shower around everyone, you could wear swimming trunks. It didn't occur to me that you might not want to because of all the other people!! :P. I will just assume that since most of them will be non-jock type people (generally), then they will not be used to those showers.. (and will probably wear swim suits!. Have you ever seen those showers before?
Wait, the new middle school?. That's super weird!. I won't need a cable, thanks!
I wonder if the AFC guys showers are like that!. O.o!
Wow!! Sign me up for one sandwich for the bus!
That sounds great!. (: Thank you!!!. I can bring you a banana!~
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too, Peter!!. ^-^

Oh, thank you! (:
Good morning!. What's it like out there?
:D!!
*meep*
:P
Thank you! I hope yours is going nicely too!!
Aw ^-^ That's nice!. I have a feeling I will be doing plenty of homework, but I'll try and knock some out on the way over!!. I am being dropped off at Cassel Colleseum. I can walk over to you, though!. Would you mind giving me a ride to my house?
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too! 
I bet :P
Good morning!
Thank you, I hope you did too!
You have a nice day, too!
Yes!
I thought home would be nice, but I don't know about that big table
Mine
Okay! . Well, there's not a whole lot of space here, nor any tables
Okay
I guess so!
Okay.
You're great
I love you!!
Wow, that sounds neat!
Sure!
I'm not sure about where and when. I will be sure to save my appetite for sweets!
I'm sorry
That's okay! I must've missed the Boyfriend equivalent
Oh good! 
You're welcome to stop by here
I'm not. Just doing homework
Okay
Anytime. We are about to eat now though, so there is food if you are hungry
(hug)
(hug)(hug)(hug)
Awesome!. My house is always open, but I will be doing homeworks (due at midnight)
Tomorrow will be good ^-^. I'm planning on sleeping early tonight, too!. (if I finish my project on time :P
^-^ Aw
Okay, thanks for making the time!
No worries, I'm just doing homework.. I should probably say, don't worry about coming tomorrow!. I'll see you on Saturday...!
:P. May I come too?
I can go to classes with Peter day!
What time would be good for me to come?
That's awfully nice of you but I'm still working on my project! . I'll come in the morning
That would be awesome! But I can drive over to save you the trouble as long as there is parking available.
Aw, cool!! :D!!!
8:30am is fine, or whatever is convenient for you!!
Noo... not me :P
Whoa.. In love or dead? :P
:D!
Aw :D !! ^=^
I love you too!
Oh no, did the chocolate melt on it?
^-^ !!. I'll be making a marketing for Trof tomorrow!
That'd be awesome!
Wow, cool!!
I am heading to sleep ^-^
Oh, what time?. Sweet dreams! (:
Got it! I'll be there, not square!. ^-^. You can stay still 9am for breakfast, if you like!. stay till*
Awesome!
I love you!
:D. !!!. Sweet dreams (:
Hehe :P Thanks!!
Good morning!. I love you!!. (:
My day has been good!! I have food and I'm doing homework for my 1pm class now!. How has your day been?
Whoa!! You've got this!. :3
Yay!. Noo, later when you have time is fine :D. I don't need it til the weekend!
That's okay :P. Work on your painting!. I won't see them til Friday
Hey :P. (hug). You're amazing!!!!
You're wonderful amazing!!. ^-^
:D!
Can you lean it against your wall on your table top?. or just against the wall and floor and work on the floor
Yay!. Good luck
Yay!. :P. Sorry, so yay
:D. Aww!. I love you!
The sun looks mischevious
*tackle*
*antiexplosion*
:D I absorbed it with my mad skillz.. Smooth sailing?
It's smooth too!
I love you, Cutie!!
Hi hi!
It's going well!! I'm off to ice skating now. How is your day?
Sounds like fun!! Did you enjoy it?
:D Tell me more afterwards, then!!
Wow, wow! Looking fantastic, Peter!. Watch out, your text started a group conversation with you and me and the other person it was sent to. 
Neat! I almost accidentally responded to the group message :P
Neat, have fun!!. (:. No need to apologize!
You're so sweet that you make me blush! (:
Then you'd better only have me in small doses! (:
I love you, Peter! 
Good morning!  (:. Large doses might be too much for you!!
^-^ You're wonderful.
Mmm, that reminds me of chocolate! ^-^
I do like chocolate!
Then you, my friend, are the star on the top of the tree ^-^
Then we make a great team! 
I hope I can be a good one!
Aww (: Don't worry, he will change his ways one day!
:D Is it mucha divertida?. (lots of fun?). Sweet dreams!. (:. (hug)
:P. Y tu tambien!
(beso). ^-^ Sweet dreams!
Good morning!  I love  you!!!
Have an amazing day, sillyhead (:
Thank you !!
Aww ^-^ I like those hugs. . And I'm sorry! No undo button on paints! I bet it looks awesome though!
It looks pretty great in all iterations!! (:. I guess you just didn't know what you wanted until it was gone! . Or you did and you were just making it better :P 
Well you will get lots of hugs either way! !!!!. Better prepare ^-^
Yup, you'd better watch out :P
I love you too!. Didja have a lovely day? (:
Oh! Do tell...!
Alright, then!
I thought we were on a friendly basis!
What circumstances brought you to an impolite dinner?
Just so!. Well there's always something to get out of it!. You have to know all types of people to be able to help them!. Not that people can just be grouped into different boxes.
Also, the people at the dinner likely have multiple attitudes depending on the situation. Everyone has a pleasant side (I've yet to be proven wrong, I think)!. But anyway, I'm glad you had dinner :P
That doesn't sound bad at all!
It is a masterpiece!
Submit tit!. it*. What else would you do?
I haven't seen it in person, but it looks like the painting has seen its share of transformation!
You've fiddled with it a lot and there's not much more you can add...!
Then fix it! I have trouble pointing anything out to fix though.
Okay!. Can't spot anything else to fix, either?. Then it's probably good to go!
I see. Anything I can help with?
It doesn't feel heavy on the left side to me. I think you can add details to the side leaves without messing up the fog. If you wanted to refine the trees in the fog, it seems like you could make the same shade brown as the one currently there
Be cautious with adding more paint on there!
I know you know, but why would you still keep changing it?
I see.
(hug)
*confetti*
hehe :P What sorts of thing so you consider "up to no good"?. I solemnly swear I am up to good!
do*. Find someone else for what?
I would tell you! But you can't really find someone if you aren't looking.
I guess I wasn't...!
You are my sweetheart though. :3
:*. Oh no :P It's worse than I remembered!. Please ignore that.. *nothing to see here*. hehe :3
I'm pretty sure that the candidates have not been solidified yet. I haven't given it much thought yet either, but probably not Donald Trump.. (if he makes it that far). :3. And you?
I know nothing :P. about Bernie Sanders
Good night and sweet dreams to you too!!. I love you lots (:. ^-^
Whoops, that Pusheen looks distressed! . Night night (:
Aw ^-^. Good morning! 
Wow!! I didn't know it was a Nom-on-Doughnuts day!
Save them for you!. Wait, Bernie Sanders is an old guy!
I'm all for free college tutition!. So I agree with him on that.. Anti-war is also nice.
Not sure why candidate Clinton uses the phrase "God-given" on her platform.. Or at least the "issue" page of her campaign website.. I'll see who the parties choose for their candidates before investigating more!. Not sure if I can have much effect on who become the final candidates.. (without getting involved in convention caucuses and such). Have a fantastic amazing day! !
Using the scanner to take pictures is an interesting idea..!
Oh no! I think there is a scanner at the library just in case. :3
Oh, you have the wrong person..!
Yup, this is Leandra!
You are the right person too!
Hi you! (:
Don't worry! I'm here again!. It's harder than that to lose me!
:D !!!
I love you too! :3. You are sweet and wonderful ^-^
I have this overwhelming perpetual longing to be around you. . That's the closest description I have for it.
^-^ I rejoice that my love is not unrequited.. Another mischievous sun?!. And me tackling you!!!
Watch out pink bear!. Yay ^-^. Awwww...... Yay!!!
Of course!!
And soon it will become a reality! 
This weekend I'd hope, but I fear not.
Yes (:. Sleep tight, Peter!
The sweetest of dreams to you too, my sillyhead ^-^
Good morning!!. (: I love you, Peter!!!
:3. I hope you are having a fantastic day!!!
Thanks!! :3
Wow!! The reception for you art exhibit!. I will send my spirits to you!
Wow! This sticker set has everything!. I'll send my spirit's spirit then!. Can you just be a UVa student? I think I need to see you more oftne!. often*. or maybe I'd better work on that teleporter more...
I guess I'm pretty lucky I get to talk to you real-time!. No, don't do that...!. Get the best job you can find, and then your possibilities are unlimited once you have that under your belt.. It's harder to work your way up than to work your way down from an incredible job.. Also, interviews once you are out of college will be harder (at least in CS) because they will expect actual past job experience.. Just reach as high as you can!. Not much animation going on here in Cville.
I mean, if you obtain a job and then want to get a new job in a "higher up" company, it will be especially hard because you need to demonstrate work experience along with general qualifications.. When you are being hired straight out of college, their hiring decision will not be based on your prior work experience, and you are often judged by how much potential they think you have.. Just my take on things.. Aka, get the most high caliber job possible straight out of college.. (Part of the reason I want to work at Google, since I know that almost anywhere would at least consider me if they knew I worked at Google for some time). (not to mention all the experience I can gain from working there!)
Plus, if you have an awesome job, you can probably easily travel on weekends!. And looks like it based on my perspective. But only if those are attractive jobs to you. If you totally despise large corporations, you shouldn't go against how you feel!
http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Walt-Disney-Animation-Studios-Reviews-E17212.htm. People will say lots of things, especially when there are so many people to hear from!. You'll hear things like that at any huge corporation (even Google).. I'm sure it's hard work.
Definitely keep looking out for places you want to work at. ^-^ You miss all the shots that you don't take...!. When thinking about where you want to work, just pretend you are the best candidate ever and anywhere will hire you.. Then the decision isn't based on how good you think you are.. And then also have some "backups" (places you would like to work that might not have as competitive of a hiring process). And apply to both!. I recommend applying to at least 10 places-- unless you get hired at your #1 position sooner than you have time to get all the applications out!. Or maybe 5, since 10 might be an intimidating number.... Or just all the places you like!. I don't think teleporters are a good idea, yet. We'll have to stick with virtual reality for now.
Well we're only 2 hours from each other!
Okay, so not a good idea for me to visit?
Aw (:
Okay!. Oh! Good luck on homework by the way!!. I'm going to go get ready for Ice Skating!!!. (:
Sorry for all the job talk. Hope it made you feel better and not worse.
I think Kiki and Toto would be a cool costume pair.. Is his name Toto?. :P. Anyway, ttfn : 3. :3
Haha. Oh hey... we're coming up on October 21st!
That's for sure!  (:
Yeah! :D
Wow, that's cool!!!
Save it for groceries!. And have a nice time!! (:
Aww (: bye Cutie!!
Okay, it's settled, you're getting all the hugs ^0^
Those hugs are so nice too!!!!. That book cover looks really nice, by the way!
Hi!! My day has gone well! (: And how was your day been?
Wow!! Tell me all about it! Free for a call?
You are pretty cool, yourself!!
An amazing wonderful one of a kind guy!!!
Having trouble finding one!
Hi!!
I love you too!!!. I slept really well! I hope you did too!!
I'm glad!!!
Oh, what happened? (:
Oooh, interesting!
Maybe it would create peace among the nations!. Aww (: A hug!
Youv'e got it!! ^0^
My day is going well Ice skating days are always fun!. How is your day going?. I guess it must be pretty good now that you know about the bottle capper.
It's so much fun!
Rawr!!! What are you excited for?
What do you mean by that? :P
Oh, I meant, what activities are you doing that you are looking forward to?
But you can be....!!!. :P
:D Don't forget to have fun!. ^-^
^-^ Yay!
(hug) (Hug)
Good luck with all the homework1. !*
Ttfn, Cutie!. (:
Aw, your bulldog is a cute old person!. I didn't notice that earlier!. :P. Not sure if the audience will appreciate the antiquity of it since he doesn't have that cool James Bond look. He's got more of a old person look going on.. (I think it's the near sighted glasses)
No no, I just meant that the glasses make him look older :P
Hmm... interesting target market!. I'm going to go to skype!. See you on the other side!!. (hug)
(:. Did you get my message where I said that I went apple picking?
Yay!
^-^. Hello!!
I hope yours has been too!. Do you have any big red ribbon, by the way?
I think I found a ribbon...!. But thanks :P
(hug). Yay!! (:
I love you, Peter! (:
Aww :P Don't worry, I already know....!
The not a dragon vibe? Totally.. :P
Hi!
I'm looking forward to seeing you!! What are you up to?
Oh cool!!! (:. Wait, I never got your reply to this text..."I am having lunch with my mom tomorrow at noon. Should I bring a car, in that case? It wouldn't be super convenient for you to take me unless you had something you needed in Blacksburg! "
Oh, okay! (:
Neat ^-^
Official arrival time is 11:08!. I got the seat with the heater!! :D
: 3
Not long, now (:
Hi! Finished?. I'm home safely!
Awesome! Why the quotes?
I liked the ones I saw...!
Good morning, Peter!!! (: I love you!!! I'm sorry about not enough sleep :(
:P. I'm glad you got sleep ^-^
Hi ! (:
Haha :P!!!. O.O whoa. Hehe :P Sweet dreams!
Good morning!!. What type of sandwich did you get?
Nom nom!
I hope you have a super awesome amazing day today!
Oh no, what has happened?
Oh no! :(. Are you wounded?
(hug)
No...!!!!. Nothing a really big hug can't fix!!. (HUG)
(: !!!. I got you! ^-^. I love you!
Sorry :P hehe
:P I meant it nicely...?
You tell me.. :3
hehe!. It is appropriate!
Ooh....Is that the seven weeks one?. It does sound cool!!
Maybe you can finally motivate me to drink tea regularly!!. With your awesome designs.
Wow...!  : O That's so many. Make sure your design is super easy to assembly.. You could use a laser cutter to cut them out, since it is too many to cut by hand.. And the laser cutter can also cut the slits, and the design can just be held together without glue, so it is easy to assemble.
assemble*. There is one here in CVille!. Come visit : 3. The 5 hours driving will be nothing compared to the time you will save!
:P No, I am coming back for Thanksgiving break.. When are you out?
Ohhh...!. Perhaps that would be good!
Tolerences.. We'd do it on a test sheet first, and see where it ends up--then it should end up in the same space after that, so we can realign the actual copy.. I'm assuming these prints will be fairly cheap, too. Since, there are 126 of them! Maybe you could have a sample of them be "higher quality", and then the bulk of them be less expensive.
I thought we could even just use a blank sheet and see what it cuts out, and then line up the actual copy based on that.
Okay :D !
Probably max 10 on an 8x11
Oh...!! You don't have to make wrappers?
(hug)
I love you too!!
I want each flavor to have a different mascot!. :P
Hmmm.. I really like the sleepytime bear.. It's my favorite!. I don't think I want sea monsters on my tea. I'd want more natural elements, or characters enjoying the tea!
Then again, when you say "sea monster", I think of a giant squid.. Which is not very appealing at all.. The loch ness monster is okay, but I don't really get how it relates to tea.. Maybe he is holding a tea cup with his tail?
Okay!. Have an awesome class!
Aw (: I love you too!!. Just white paper?. I get mine from the school printers!. I hope you did well, but do not worry!
Wow :3. Bye for now!
I love you!!
(:
That's you!!. I need a hug :3
Oh good!!!. (:. As soon as possible is fine!. (hug)
Yay!. ^-^
I'll try and stop by on the 13th1. !*
Oh, too soon?. Then you can come see me on Friday :D!
:3
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!!!!
I love you Peter!!. Sleep tight!
As long as you are the wrapper!. Night night!. (:. (hug)
Good morning! !!!  . Oh no, is your battery acting like mine?
https://checkcoverage.apple.com/
:3 Awww...!. Like us?
Aw :(
It is!! My battery warranty is 3 years too, which is why I must replace it soon!. It decided to fail too early, though! :P
(Hug) I love you so so much!
^-^. Awwww! !!! ^-^. Would you like to accompany me to the RMS string concert on the 21st?
Awesome!!! How is your day going?
It's fantastic!!
You get hugs for dazzling me!! (:
Watch out, you might even get a kiss : 3
(:
(hug)(hug)
I love you too, Peter!
Wow, you're really cute!!!. (: Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!
Aww (:. Sounds so awesome!
Please do!
Where is it?
Oh, I see!. I like the 2nd :3. Sweet dreams!!!
Good morning! !. Yay, it's summery weather! !
:O
Yum, cake for breakfast! !
(: just because I'm talking to you !
:P Nah I'd rather have healthy food
:P cake is exciting, but so is delicious healthy food!!!
Yess!!! You know the good stuff :3
And I will give you lots of hugs!. :3 Can't wait to spend time with you!!. I'm hoping you can stay during your Thanksgiving break!
I will see if the study room will be empty as it draws closer.... May not be able to accompany you during nights though.
Okay!!. You'd only be staying 4 nights, so that doesn't sound like too much!. To ask, I mean. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16318?checkin=03%2F05%2F2016&checkout=03%2F13%2F2016&guests=2&s=7m5SPR-m ?. For spring break?. :P. And horseback riding stopover on the way down and up!. :P. I bet there are some good places between here and florida!. Any activities you've been wanting to do?. Might need you to learn stickshift for this trip to be possible, since I only have access to a manual car.. (And the drive is so long!)
Where would we get that?
Ones you could just take away for the weekend?. week*. week + 2 weekends. Are you interested?. :3 !!. And the horses?!!!
I can try and teach you
Oh good!
Yes, but the first may have been too light. I think the second was much easier to read!
I love you too! ! ! 
I'll put it back in you!. Sorry, was that a weird comment? I was just being literal?
I love you too!!!!! Thank you!!
Aw, thank you!!! I'm here for you too!!!!
^-^ I'm pretending the moon is you!
(Hug)
I hope you are having the best est time!!!
There was the option!!. :P don't worry though (hug)
Next time :3 !!
No, but it doesn't strike me as unusual.
Yes, that sounds like quite the surprise
Yay, cat!!!!
Can I please be that cat. ?*
This is how I feel about you!!
:D!!!. It was so much fun staying with you!!!!!!. (Hug)
Really? :D !!! Are you qualified to make such an offer?
Well I would love to see you next weekend!!!!!!!!!!. :3. I will be really quiet and won't interfere with your homework!!
My dream!!!
I can interfere as much as you want!!!. I'm glad you are eating!!!!!
(: 
Rawr, I love you so so much!!!!!
I haven't progressed much!
No team, I think that is my problem!
I missed it :P 
I'll sleep at 11 and pull something together in the morning!. I had my chance, I gotta go solo now!
I'm not looking very hard :P Oh!!! That sounds nice for morale!
Aw :3
Thank you!!!
That looks so so so comfy!!!. I am going to stay up til midnight and just sleep more, I think!!. I mean, sleep later*
That sounds amazing!! Sign me up! (:
Is this an open appointment system?. Since when did you become a professional pillow/bed? :P
(: from me?. By the way, may I use your creativity and logo design?. WhoNews?
Oh good!!! ^-^ You're my only boyfriend pillow!! (:
You can do it anytime! I am waking up at 7am!. Or more like 7:30am, I think
Just cool font is fine!!. Sweet dreams!! (:. It's just a service for people to share summarized current events. Good morning! ? . !*
Asap :3
Whoa, maybe more friendly feeling. . I want it to feel inviting! (:. But that looks like it would be perfect for a fact sheet about world hunger!. There are honey bunches of oats here!!! My favorite sugary cereal $!!!!
Oh, I see! The primary usage of this logo will be in the top corner of the navbar on a Web app. I would like it to be a nice color!. Thank you so so much! Sorry for not being super clear!
Just a nice color! I'm trying to stay away from newspapers altogether, because people find them boring!. Am I a bad client? :P
I just want some sans-serif serif font that is a nice color, I think!
Your choice!. It's fine, I don't want to waste more of your time on something I could probably do.
You can add any icon you think is appropriate!!
If you can think of something :P . Maybe a cute cat
Or a light bulb!
Don't worry too much!!!
Thank you!! It's beautify!!
My teammate thinks it's awesome !!!!!
Can I trouble you for a png?. (transparent background)
If you zip it, and send as file, it will work!
Thatnk you so so so so much!!. (hug). I love you, Cutie!!
:D I am looking forward to this too!!
They just keep getting better!!!
It went well!! 
Yes! I won knowledge!. Aw ^-^!!!!
That's all!
I'm up for it!
Depending on the complezity, I think there is an auto generator for RPGs, since the game logic is very repeatable
I am a big fan of learning games. But if you want to make the game, it should probably be your vision
Neat!
I can definitely assist in code!
You will likely need an additional enthusiastic coder, though
Sounds good!
(: I love you!!. How are you?
I am fantastic! What trifle troubles you?
There must be a youtube video for that!!
I'm sorry!
Oh no :(
Oh good!!!!! (:
I love you!!
Whoops, I didn't have hands for the phone! But I got home around 10:20pm safely! 
Hello!
In class and good!
I'm interested if you will be there!!
I got a ticket! (No ride yet, though :P). I love you too!!! How is your day going? Did your work yesterday go well?
That's great!!! You're so good ^-^
Tea makes me feel warm! . Where is nine muses from?
Oh, interesting! Is one Muse calipso?. I didn't know there were so many!!!
Oh yeah!. Calipso is from Pirates of the Caribbean! 
Oh, right!! I think that's what I meant? :P
Neat!
Nah :P
No me gusta 
What do you envision them as?
I don't much like the idea, but it's up to you
I think it is terribly sexist 
Because the nymphs should be men, also.
What is the target market?
Cute animals, of course!!. Polar bear= peppermint . Chai= cat. Earl grey = owl. Because he's fancy
And he is an earl!. One owl has a different color
And cute puppy!
(Hug)!!!. (:
I love you!!! (:
Hmm, that doesn't sound like a useful feature!. :P
Dun dun dun!
Oh, interesting!!!
 Woo!
I think I would like it!!!
Hello!!
I am well!! (: how are you?
(Hug)
I am on the way to Blacksburg! Leaving with Emma Boyd in Black Acura. . 7038502287
Yes!
Not yet confirmed, but pretend it's Cassel for now
Got it! 
Eta 7:22. Should I get dropped off at your house so I can go inside?. Ttfn
Okay ! I'll try, but check your messages. By3!
Yes?. You okay? 
Okay! Is it cool if I stay at your house til my mom gets home?
Oh, I will get dropped off at my house I think, since my mom is home!. And that's okay!
Hopefully you can get the car working before then!!
I came to see you, of course!
Oh, is there enough parking?
I will drive over in the morning when it is not so dark!
You either!  But you know the road better?
Of course!!! I wish I could've seem you already!! But I will see you soon!! How early will you be ready?
:D 7am ;P
:P 
^-^. I forgot, why were you in an MRI?
What does that mean?
Normally an MRI is when something is wrong with your brain?
Was it your back?. MRI scans are expensive so it must be very serious!
Well as long as the results were negative for whatever it was!!
Oh no! Do you still have body problems? That probably sounds worse than it is. You get hugs anyway!!. How are you doing?
I'm doing well! I'm being very well fed :P
(Hug) you've got it!
That's for with you!. I love you!
Good morning!!!
I'm okay! How are you?
I hope so!
When do you think you'll be done printing?
Okay, what is the best place to park?
Whoa, I never knew it was a sheriff's car!
Wow!
Will you be inside Porterfield?
Will you be inside the printing lab the whole time?. I should probably wait til you are done if I won't see you!
Can I go inside?
Cool!
Should I go straight to your house?. Arriving at 2:40pm. At your house
Sweet dreams, Peter!!
:D Good morning, you!!
I love you, too!!
Oh good!
Just need some guy models, too :P
Guys can sit however they like
That's fine, as long as you aren't a perpetuater of gender sterotypes and discrimination and such.
I'm positive it's not your intention, but just be careful what you say!. I should be too!
No worries!
Are you free for a call?
Good morning! !!. Don't forget the oatmeal!! (:
https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostLifestyle/videos/10153291047191314/?fref=nf. Did you try this with your cat?
Maybe they are not as stretchy due to the complex design!! If they don't work out, I can help you wear them! I'd love to see them though :P
Why are the cucumbers so scary?
You can do it!! Go go Peter! ^-^. I bet I would be scared too.
I love you, Peter! ^-^. Scary cucumbers!. ^-^. Have an awesome fantastic day!!!. (:
I hope it went well!!
(hug)
That's too bad, but at least you have more time to make it good!
I won't bother you then! Keep it up! : 3
Do you need motivation? Or a chat?
In my previous annotated bibliographies, I was allowed to include those sorts of sources! Because that means I spent time investigating them and I know why they won't work. In that case I just described why their not suitable.. they're*
I am headed to small group now!. Wishing you luck with your project!!
I love you, too!! (:
(hug). I'm glad you are finished! (:. On to the next challenge!
Whoa?!
There were once very many kinds of tea in your house, if I remember!
Howdy!
It's going well!! This systems homework is riveting! How is it going for you?
You are welcome to come whenever you finish, even if that happens to be later than Friday!
Hooray! ^-^ I have a class on Friday until 5:15pm, so anytime after then is free game! Or earlier, if you don't mind waiting!. Sweet dreams!. I love you very very much!!!
:D You're wonderful!
:D!!!!!!!. Winter hug (:. How nice ^-^
Hi, you!. Would you like to come to Bella's with me on Monday evening?. Perhaps 6:30pm?
Oh good :D ! You'll get to meet my professor :P
Well you are fantastic ^-^. So don't worry.
I love you!! (:
I hope you are well ^-^
How are your gears turning?
Whoa, did you Five Guys french fries have a specific smell?. I could recognize it from across the room :P. Oh, it is "cajun spices" ^-^.. Good luck on the tea designs!. I am headed out to dinner :3. ^-^ Ttfn!
Thank you!!
Goodnight (:
Whoops, just about to go brush my teeth!. ^-^. Be right back!
Not a problem!! Sorry to not be right back so soon!. Sweet dreams (:. I love you too!!. I ate fancy food today!!. Lamb Osso Bucco?!. I am saving you part of the butternut squash tart with panna cotta!. (hug). Night night ^-^
:P. ^-^. I love you!!. Night night!
That's me getting to see you tomorrow!! (: Yay!
:P The second one!. Good morning!. I hope you have such a nice day!!
Awesome!. I think I know what I am making for my Secret Santa gift!. Maybe you can help me with it this weekend :P. Or not, since you will be busy! But it would be fun working on it with you a little!. (Hint: it's wood work!)
I'll be using the laser to cut the wood! I think I will need thinner wood then the one that you used. I want to make a laser cut wooden lamp or hanging lantern! (like these... http://lamusicblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/01.jpg, https://www.etsy.com/listing/239231588/table-lamp-lamp-laser-cut-wood-lamp?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=&ref=sr_gallery_30). I might need help with the design, though!
Oh that's cool!! Does Scott just have extra wood he is trying to get rid of?. I think pine would be good!
Aww ^-^. Okay, bye for now!. 1/4 inch seems about right.... The etsy person said they used 1/8th, so I guess that is possible too!. Probably 1/4th would be more durable!
How nice of you!. How big is the uncut wood?
As long as it will fit on the bed of the laser cutter, it will be fine!
(18inx32in) I believe?. You focus on your own homework for now :P
I thought I might do something similar to the tree, but incorporate the intervarsity logo: http://www.virginiaivcf.com/
That could work for a taller rectangular lamp. But you can leave them as long as possible as long as it is less than 32"!. And I can always buy wood if needed, but might need your assistance on travel :P
Neat!!
Neat! I hope so too!
^-^
Is there such a thing as an "appropriate shape" https://www.google.com/search?q=high+end+tea&safe=active&espv=2&biw=1517&bih=665&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMI6djWhpOdyQIVzBweCh02OwYC&dpr=0.9. They all look different to me!
Oh I see.
I hope so! ^=^
Hi hi!
Yes ^_^ and you?
Me too!
Okay! There is a lot of scrap wood here! It might be enough!. Well, probably not, but there is always home depot!. Thank you for trying!
Did you get it?? :D
But also this?!?. I think I'd pick the Taiwanese food!
Oh yeah, you are 1/8th ?
Sorry, so many invitations :P
No way?!?!!. Aw, I hope it's not this weekend :P
That is funny :P. I'm basically sending you invitations to everything that we could go to this weekend!. But it's mostly food stuff!
Wow, nice progress!!!. (:
Aw, you like me ^-^. I can tell because you accept all my invitations!
I like you so so so much!!
(hug)
You always impress me with your hard work!!
Whoa.. What happens if you paint without masking?. Can't you just photoshop out the border?
That's silly :P. How can you tell? Does it look like something is missing?
Oooh, interesting!
Woo! Tea paintings and all?
Oh, okay!!
Be safe!!!. : 3. I am looking forward to possibly seeing you tomorrow!!. Sweet dreams!
Hehe, you need some more cat safe places?. Maybe on top of higher furniture like the counters. Good morning! !
Good morning!!!. All dry?
There is definitely a printing service somewhere. Is your particularly inexpensive/good?
You can definitely print here and I can't see it being that much more expensive! I'll pay the extra just so you can come! (:
 About $2, no idea about the quality.
Alc copies
Status update. ?*
Okay 
Yay!!!! I'd love to see you!!!!!!. Don't forget to check oil
Be so so safe! (:
Awesome!!!! (:
It's until 8pm!
Whoops, I thought you left already ;P
That's okay, take your time!. Come tomorrow if you don't want to drive in the dakr
Oh I am ready1. !*. I will try to save you some pizza.. I am not sure if there is Pho to go!
No, but try and eat a little snack so you're not hungry while driving!! 
Bring warm clothes!! Good jacket, hat and gloves!
Sleeping bag ! But you can use mine if that's hard!
Hehe ^-^

Hello, Peter!
The pumpkin is good! (:
Yes :D My sister already ate one.
She liked it, but she said it had no sugar in it at all!
It's better this way (:
Who is Jamison Laser?
Oh, okay!
Okay, not a problem!
Sounds great, but a little expensive for just a secret santa present.
I will be everyone's Santa. :P
Everyone will get a lamp for christmas!
And you get my special book..!
I'm not either, I just knew she probably wrote a book and might give it out as a consolation prize!
I will likely be free tomorrow!. Well I am free tomorrow!
I am free tomorrow.
Sweet dreams!
I love you, too!
Good morning.
I hope your sleep was great too! I am exercising and looking at some of the black Friday deals. What about you?
What about Condivo 14? I'm looking at winter coats for you!. What sort of coat do you like?
Like this kind? http://www.jcpenney.com/free-country-colorblock-jacket/prod.jump?ppId=pp5005720088&catId=cat100290087&deptId=dept20000014&&_dyncharset=UTF-8&colorizedImg=DP0626201517015453M.tif
But are you in need of a winter coat? And which style do you like the most?
Less flashy? Like fewer colors?
It comes in black/grey?
Yes
It looks warm!. It looks cool and sporty too.
:P What is your idea of a cool jacket?. http://www.jcpenney.com/zeroxposur-dozer-midweight-jacket/prod.jump?ppId=pp5005840691&cmvc=JCP|dept20000014|cat100290087|RICHREL&grView=&eventRootCatId=&currentTabCatId=&regId=&rrplacementtype=item_page.dpcontent3. This one?
You prefer fancy to warm?
Also, that one has a permanently attached scarf :P
http://www.jcpenney.com/stafford-peak-lapel-topcoat/prod.jump?ppId=pp5003161258&cmvc=JCP|dept20000014|cat100290087|RICHREL&grView=&eventRootCatId=&currentTabCatId=&regId=&rrplacementtype=item_page.dpcontent3
I'd argue it's important to care about the way you look to an extent. Maybe you meant something else?
Aw man, but the sale ends at 2pm...
That gives you about 2 hours!
Navy blue, okay!

pea coats?
You'd rather not have one?
I've never heard of anything negative associated.. I'm so stuck.. I'm not sure what your "chest size" is, either.
Okay! (: Which coat has been your favorite so far?
Your favorite coat is the peacoat?
Thank you!. Are long coats out?. Whoops :P. They use "shoji rice paper" !
Okay! I will take a look! Something else that has a similar opacity would work!
I'll try to go in the morning!
Thank you!!
hehe :P Pink bear looks concerned!
I'm not concerned (:
I hope so!!
I request 5 cuddles!
Oh really?!. We'll just have to go together and fun!
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!!
Good morning! !. Have fun laser cutting!. Try the files in illustrator... should be able to go straight from print dialogue...
O.o! As long as it is recommended!  can always test on three pages of printer paper
Thank you! It was lots of fun!!
Hello!!! I am super sad to have missed this...!
Oh, hi! !!
That's so wonderful (:. How are you?
:3
Your pumpkin pie was amazing this morning!
I will rave about it for you!. And I would like to help with the pie next time!
Maybe maybe...!. I think there will be pie where we're going O.o!
Aw (:. Sweet dreams to you!
I love you too! (:
Perfect! . I'll catch up with you on Wednesday night :P. https://akshatrathi.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/my-tryst-with-polyphasic-sleeping/. http://fitjerk.com/polyphasic-sleep/. 2nd article has the schedule
I'll help you with the food expenses! I can try and advise you on quick recipes, too!
I think facebook has a send money option now, but I normally use Venmo!
Or I can just repay you cash later! Use the adventure fund..!
Hooray!!. Sweet dreams to you (:
Gotta sleep early to wake up early!
Unless you're everyman :P. And tons of other wxceptions. I can motivate you!!. Go Peter :D Go get that A.
You can do it!!. Or is the time up?. By the way, when is your very last due date/exam?
Oh!! I won't keep you then1. (: Have an awesome day!. I'll go shower too!
Aw, nice drawing!!
Where are you and I/
Sweet!
:P
It looks great (:. You are amazing!! ^-^
Celebrating the awesome job you're doing!
Looks painful! :P
Cacti aren't immune to spikes! . :D. Bear hugs are great!!. Pies galore!
I can freeze you a piece if you like!!. Pecan or apple or some chocolate whipped cream looking one (showed up after I took the picture O.o!)?. Are you doing anything between 12/11-12/13?
Whoa whoa.. I was thinking about visiting/picking up a car, but I could always just chill with my Mom!
That sounds delightful, but I find the proposition of actually getting work done challenging!. So which pie did you choose?
I'm gonna go caramel peanut buttery whipped cream?. Or... apple?. Or pecan?. Oh no, it might just be all three depending on how long they last.. I'll give it til Thursday.
Hooray for Peter!
You do :3
Not since I saw you last!
I'll get you! :3
Sweet dreams to you too!!
With you! ^-^
Good morning!! I hope you are doing well with everything! !
It is neat, but they always look professional, so I wonder what was different about these ones!
Awesome!! I look forward to seeing them ^-^
I look forward to seeing you too!!
I love you too!! :D. (: Cuddles!!
I did (:
I'm glad you sent it to me!
Oh good!!
How are you?
I'm doing well! I'm going skating!
I would have liked to see that one too!
At the rink!  Ttfn
Whoops, just saw this! I can take pictures for you next time I go!
I thought it would be perfect for you since it is a UX hackathon!. I love you! ! ^-^
It's Winter Song. My first full Lighting of the Lawn experience!. Yes, user experience!
User experience? It's a very broad subject!!. Aw :3. One of the a capella groups sang a Marianas Trench song!!!!
You're my favorite, too!. This is the experience of the user when they are filling out a form online!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViCAaK5NuTY
Just sweating?. From your eyes...?. I like the illustrations!
So cute!
Ah, so sad. It got me!
:3. I love you, Peter!!!. *tackles*. Sweet dreams (:
:D. I got you!
Oh good! (:
I hope your day is going fantastically too!!
How so?
That doesn't sound like a waste to me! : 3
Keep on it! ^-^
If that's what works for you!. Just stay sane.. :P
^-^ I believe in you!
Okay! (:. I'm going to watch Christmas movies with my small group tonight!. Any suggestions?
Interesting selection.... :P
It's true!. I'd rather watch something new, though!
Thanks for the suggestions!. I did like Arthur Christmas!
I guess the company is more important than the movie!
I wouldn't mind watching Love Actually or The Holiday again. :P. We'll see what happens...!. Have fun working on projects!
We watched Holiday in Handcuffs! 
It's an ABC family movie :P. I liked it!. Now I am home watching the Incredibles!!
It's so good!!!. :3 I was going to do work and watch it, but it was too good!. And such good quality on our projector!!
It really is!!
I will watch it with you!
Just put french subtitles on for extra entertainment! 
Sweet dreams, you!!
I love you too, Peter!. Good morning!!
Oh hi there!. How is your day progressing?
It is good!!
I am sorry your day is not progressing well :(. May I do anything to help?
Searching for the perfect ones?
Oh, I remember all the concept sketches you did!!
We are about to surprise Liz $. !*
Face cake!!
They sure did like it!! (:. Thank you for all your help with that!. It was a surprise engagement party!
No, I won't . And yup!! . Not til 2017 though,  I think. Sweet dreams (:
The Chuck one looked good! Or Firefly, but that's so many characters. Good job!!
Sleep tight! 
You've got this!. How about Psych?
Anniversary / cast reunion?. I'm going to fall asleep now :P bye!
I love you too!
How are you doin?. doing*. Happy Sunday!
hehe :P. I'm doing okay!
Liz was my secret Santa! !!. I received a penguin blanket!!!!!. So cute!. I feel like I appreciate humans more after watching some cool videos. Maybe we can watch the whole thing togther!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99gJKzINNow
Yes :P It's awesome!
Penguins and polar bears have always been friends! (:
Well they don't interact under usual circumstances!  :P And they need an army to stay warm and work together!
The ninja penguin armies mission is to defend in a nonviolent way!. army's*
Soon all arctic animals will see the way of peace!  (:
And perhaps leopard seals will be a tough target too!
You're right! They're quite popular among them!
Hi! I like you too!!
I will be sure to still have hands next time I see you, then!
Aw, thanks ^-^. I am looking forward to seeing you too!. How are the illustrations coming along?. I know they're most likely due tonight, so I won't distract you if you're not done yet!
Oh I hope it goes well!!!
Oh good!
Hooray!!!
Still hooray!
Woo! What is left before the end of the semester?
Awesome!!. One step at a time..
So, done on Wednesday?. Or is that just as far in the future as you listed?
Oh! It is an unknown deadline, but it is at least a week away?
Makes sense!
You are excused!
No, but the sticker was enjoyable!
No, they are appreciated! (:
Yes!
That sounds fantastic!
About schoolwork?. Or something else?
You can do it!. You get that A, Peter!. ^-^
You can do anything you set your mind to!
I hope it will be! (:
Good morning!. Matching scarves!
Much better than no messages at all!. I'm okay with that!
Then I will let you know, and we can work something out. But for now I must let you work on your spec book, and I will go get ready!
Thank you! I hope you do too!!
I love you too!! 
Hehe :P This is the thing I was telling you
That's perfect!
I hope you are having a great day!
I hope you are doing better now perhaps!
You can make it!. :3. And even if you don't, I will still love you!
Oh good! (:
Sweet dreams to you too!! (:
I love you so so much too!!
I will if I can find a ride!
You are most welcome!
Is it seeming okay?. Oh, that's good!
hehe. It looked fine on you in the store!
Yummy!
I am excited for you!
Oh, I'm glad you like it!!. :D ! Can I join you on the rocket ship? Sounds like fun!!
That's perfect!!. ^-^. Okay, I am going to get some sleep so I can work better on this in the morning!
I'm sorry about that! I am not disappointed in you!
Okay, sounds good!. Stay hydrated!. Sleep tight!. I love you!
Oh no! Hopefully tomorrow will be different!. Night!
Good morning!!
:D. I hope your day will be much better today!!. What are your plans?
How fun!!
Is it the Radford library?  The University one just needs your student id!
Oh neat!. New library cards are exciting! A new world of possibility!
Yay!
Aw, thank you, Peter!!
I appreciate the thought!
How nice (:
The hard part is only napping for 20 minutes
I am!. It is very difficult.. But I will definitely conquer sleep!
No way that sounds fantastic does that mean you have more then you think you had?. No way! That *
Whoa whoa that is so cool!!!! So what is left besides that photo? 
That sounds really good!!! Good job, Peter!
A little everyday! An hour a day should get you pretty far!. And it guaranteed won't be as terrible as writing it all at once!
Makes sense, but I wouldn't recommend that approach when writing your next novel!  :P
Yes, very! (: Are you happy?
Do not worry! I want you as my boyfriend. It is not solely a matter of making me happy though! People make me happy. Life makes me happy.
Oh! What sorts of things? Specific to me, or just some other person's exerpience?. experience*
Let me know what troubles you and I will try to dispel it!
Is it worth repeating?
It's been awhile since I remember you saying a thing like that!. Don't worry though! I don't send hearts to just anyone!
Well not to worry!
I can make myself available in about 5 minutes if I leave now...
Okay! Ttfn
Why thank you! (:
No need for that!  (:
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!!!!
I hope you do too!
I don't understand either. :P
I'm so excited for the acapella concert I'm going to see in UVa chapel!. a capella*?
Thanks! I hope they do their famous Winter Song/White Winter Hymnal mashup!
There is a video of it!. I think I sent it to you last year :P. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHkCnU5eItE
I wish you could too! We can go to an a capella concert next time you visit!
Good job regardless!
It was fantastic!
How is your paper going?
I'm glad you're getting things done! (:. I am headed back to Blacksburg tomorrow at 8am
Oh no, I forgot again! !
That's true....!
Thank you! 
I love you too Peter!!( ^ w ^)
Hehe :P
I would love to see you, but I don't want to distract you!. I'll get to see you plenty after you finish all your finals!
I would love to distract you, then !. Sweet dreams for now. I'll let you know when/if I leave tomorrow! . I love you!
Thank you!! I am leaving at 8:20am!
I just got home!
What are you up to now? I am free to distract you!! 
Would you be staying in Blacksburg for the weekend? I could visit you, but it wouldn't make sense to drive both ways if you'll be coming back here?
I'd love to see you! I have hugs for you. I could visit for a bit tomorrow though, if you don't make it out this way. I bet your mom would love to see you though!
You are invited to my house!
Yes! At least until my mom gets home!
I'm sure my mom would be happy to have you over though!. Would you like to do activities?
I'm having a little karaoke right now, but we could play in the park because it's beautiful or go to the duck pond or anything your heart desires!
Okay! Sure thing!
Assume it's a yes unless I say otherwise!
Just you!
How long is a bit? 
That sure is just a bit compared to the total!. See you soon !. I should have invited you officially last night so you would already be here :P
My hinting is not quite as effective as the directness.. "Leaving at 8:20am, see you at 11am at my house!"
Is what I should have said $. !*
Nah, it might mean something else next time. But yes, I do prefer times, otherwise it's like three hours later! . Did you want to meet at the ducknpond or gardens?
Duckpond!!!
Because ducks!
Okay! see you at 2:10pm?
Awesome! See you then!
Bye
That is good! !! I really really enjoyed the day with you too!!! You are so sweet (:
Alas, we must sleep! . :P Sweet dreams (:
That sounds wonderful! !!
Thanks! I hope your day is going well too!
Where is somewhere? 
It's really nice outside today!!
As long as it is warm and there is an outlet nearby!
Sounds good to me!
Where are we meeting?
The park sounds good to me!. I might be driving my mom's car to Jackie s if we manage to start it!
No, I'm alright, thanks though!. Just wanted to let you know in case it took up your time!. I love you so so so soso sos os os much! Please give me hugs~!
Oh yes :P Thank you!
That's nice of you!! I'm pretty content without one though! (I use the tuner on my phone when I play)
I think it is a better practice to try and find the right pitch on my own!
Neat! It's a recommendation I won't be taking.
Really well!. I'm going to nap now :P. How is your day going?
That's great!!. (:
Oh good!!
Sounds like an awesome idea!!
Good to look on the bright side!
I love you!!! 
(:
A strict no picture policy?. Good of you to ask!  I would've just gone for it! I see you've had bad experience in the past!. I'm glad it went well!
I'm sure no one would care much!. It helps if you are well dressed though (suit). And perhaps carry a clipboard.. Then when they ask if you're from corporate, say that you're not permitted to say..... :P
:P
;). Well I'd better keep studying! So I'll ttfn!. Or wait..
So I'll go. Ttfn!. *
Oh good!!!. (:

(:. Kristen's post on the intervarsity page: "I was enjoying Winter Formal when spudenly not one but two potatoes appeared in my tote bag! Isn't that apeeling? Let me know if you need your tubers back...otherwise these idahoes will be sold to the Mr. Potato Head Authenticity Team.". So great.
I don't know!
Such admiration.
I was wondering why those potatoes were in our room...

RAWR!. (:

I love you too, Peter!!
Oh good!!. (hug)
?!. What is a waterproof pen?
Sounds scary!
But useful for averting the ink crisis of 2009
No :P. But there was something... sometime... somewhere...
Coming to a place near you on Thursday December 17th!
We'll make it!. Oh no, random clicking!. I pick the yellow one!. (:
Sweet dreams to you!
Aww (:. :D I'm looking forward to that!
Sleep tight!
I love you too!!
We'll probably go to the movies! I'm not sure which film we'll see though!
Exam time!
Thank you!
The good song!!
It's almost as long as the movie itself!
I can't find the cool song!. It's mostly quiet music
Oh I found it!. Yay!. How are you? What are you doing today?
I am well!
Oh thank you! I found a cute sheep video on youtube that features this song!
Yay! Finally got the thing from Saturday working!. :P So silly that hours of trying things can just be fixed with one word change.. Or to reword that... Just kidding, that one sounds okay, I think. It's nice that I found it though, because I thought I would have to be working for many more hours!
Thank you! ^-^ Now I will have more time to study!!
You keep up the good work too!. I'm looking forward to reading your comic!
http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/derp-cat-meme.jpg
No, that's a cat :P
Good progress nonetheless! (:
Write a little bit every day!. Maybe get a rough draft going tonight.. It's always so better if you space it out.
Then just try your hardest!. :3. keep trying your hardest*. since you already are.. Nothing to worry about!. Such papers of exam weeks past have been written in one day by students. You can do it too!
You've done some research, I heard!
Well no matter what you say I am not going to tell you that it's impossible!. :P. Even if you had to start from scratch. You can do it!
Sweet dreams!
Happy shorts weather!
I love you too!!!. I hope you are having a fantastic day!!. http://www.lovesushiking.com/concept.php. Can it compare to Misakos? We will have to find out!
haha :P Because it's like an experiment?
It's all about the taste, dude! And I haven't tasted it yer.. Yet*
You're fine! Perhaps it was warranted by my usage of dude!
That's crazy, dude!. :P
I like you too! (:
Wow, are those golden llamas!. I hope you solve your problem!
You can do it!. Keep up the hard work!. But stop if you feel stressed!
Due at midnight tonight?
Well you have to sleep eventually unless you are planning to stay up all night!. You should probably nap without fear of falling asleep, because it would be okay if you fall asleep, right?
Sleep is good!. You could work until you are no longer productive!
Time for sleep!
Enjoy!. Note that the idea sleep time is either 1.5 hrs or 20 minutes, otherwise you might feel worse waking up from it!
Yay!. I hope you feel good when you wake up!. Sleep tight!
I love you too! ^-^
Hi!. Sweet dreams to you!
Good morning!
Whoa, go you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I thought it was due tomorrow?. Amazing that you are finishing early, if so!!!!!!!!!!!. Well amazing by my usual habits.
Oh! So 6 more pages on the brand book?. You can do it!. (:
Yay!
Has the expense of printing ever been brought up in the class? (Ex. in the syllabus?). I feel like being able to afford it would be a concern for many students, and your professor may have addressed this at some point?. Well just something to think about. If I were in your class, I would try to get out of it anyway I could :P. I bet you already have too!. Good luck on printing and motion graphics!
Strange that they've never mentioned how expensive it is, or given you advice on how to reduce the costs?. Maybe they recommend printing services?. If you are struggling just to have enough money to eat, it seems like a conversation you should be having with a professor! He might make an exception and just be okay with digital work.   It seems so silly to me that he would get you all to waste so much money on printing paper copies, when he could just grade it digitally!
But I'm not the one living it, so I cannot speak fully to your dilemma.. If I were you, I would visit your professor after class or during office hours, or just email him and tell him that you are out of money, and simply cannot print the final project, and ask if there are any alternatives and how you don't think it should affect your grade because that would be discrimination against poor people.. :P. Well you don't have to listen to any of this, or refute it-- I just want you to know it's an option, and there is always a loophole...!. shouldn't *
All the more reason to try it out! Maybe he/shel'll make an exception since it's just "one time". Unless you're being super last minute about it... In that case I guess you could say that you are about to print in today, but it came to more money than you can afford since it is so long, and could you send it as a pdf instead and maybe you could only print a selection of pages instead of the whole thing and that your funding for next semester hasn't come in and everything about it...!
it*. You can't know if you don't try! And it certainly cannot affect your grade just to ask.
If it gets past a certain time and he hasn't responded, you should go ahead and print it though.
I'm sure the pdf will export eventually... if not, I'm guessing you'll try restarting first, and then worst case try it on another computer?. Ttfn! Good luck with everything!
Whoops. I thought it was just an indesign file, so if another computer has indesign, you could open it on there!. I hope it worked!
Ah, of course!. Would you like to go hiking with me on Friday?!
Isn't that Thursday night?. I'll see about that!. Maybe Sunday or Monday then
Wow, good job!!. Keep it up!
Hi there!
I'm doing very well!!!. How are you?
Keep chugging!. (:. You've got it!
Nap time!
I'm doing well! I'm doing laundry and packing and cleaning!
Hooray! We will be done by tomorrow!
If your paper is thesis involved, I always found it helpful to use the "DBQ structure". Introduction: Begin with historical/background context.. End the intro with your thesis, given as a statement that is formulated by thinking... "I believe...." but don't include "I believe" in your thesis.. Your thesis should clearly lay out your following paragraph topics/ overall ideas of the paper, as well as state a claim which you are proving for the rest of the paper. Next, your paragraphs are the different reasons why you think your thesis is correct, supported by resources.
And the conclusion is just a summary and maybe reveals something deeper.... I think the way you described your assignment to me, it could not be hurt by following this general format.  It's a lot better to have some sort of structure to your paper, or at least introduce all your main ideas at the beginning!. Or at least have main ideas and an overarching statement/theme which is supported by sources!. If you are already given a strict format to your paper, then that would be helpful!. helpful, too.
Then DBQ style it up!. :P. Plus, you have lots of practice already
You'll just have to really really draw out your ideas.. I just listed basically everything you need to know!
Another tip is that when citing documents, the quotes do not just speak for themselves-- the link between whichever sources/quotes you may use and your thesis need to be thoroughly explained by you.. And since it is a 15 page paper which you are writing in one night, succinctness is not your friend here.. Try and run with each reason category (first defined in your introduction), for as long as you can!. Your paper could even have two different thesis/ things you are proving, as long as that doesn't make it too confusing!. (though this is strongly advised against in usual DBQ writing). Is there a formal prompt statment?. prompt*. statement*. Like the assignment guidelines
Ah, well.. Hopefully you have enough to start.
The biggest thing you need is the point of your paper.. What are you trying to make people believe?. Or inform people about?
Why did you choose that title?
What do you want to readers to come away with? Is it just a multi autobiography?. multi biography***
How does this even relate to the images/words prompt?. (just trying to give you questions that might help you form your paper)
How are they related? What are their reasons for creating the story?
Why?. Are you bringing any new insights to the table or are you just restating the viewpoints of other authors?. (the second is acceptable if this is a research paper)
Well, you should just follow your heart then, since in this case, completing the page requirement seems more valuable then having fewer high quality pages?. fewer pages that are higher quality*
Oh!! then definitely plan out a structure!!!
Cool!. Sounds like you have topics to write about...! Have fun ^-^. I'm going to finish packing/cleaning, and then hardcore study until midnight!
:D Write until you finish ^-^ !. Yay!
I just have to wait for my clothes to dry now, and then I will finish packing in the morning!
Sweet dreams!
Then don't do it!
No, I must study.. I support you though and will read it once you finish!. Night!
Probably after you turn it in!
I can call you, but after 5 minutes of not picking up, is it okay if I stop?. You should just set 10+ on your phone, and then it will be the same thing?
Sure. I see you are awake!
I love you too!!!
Goodnight and good luck!
I love you too!
Gift idea for that special senior in your life? :P. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sycgL3Qg_Ak
It's an advanced furreal friend! 
That's the real advice that took all that time to learn! :P Good thing I already know. . It's kind of scary to realize that no one really knows what they're doing :P. But it makes forging your own path even easier
Awesome! I'm glad you're safe!!. Easier, because it means whatever you're doing now is probably just as good as what anyone else could do. It's a good confidence booster!
I figure you'll be needing some sleep after staying up all night!!
Oh, why is that? Did you want to go to Beeks with me tomorrow (get there at 11am)
I'd rather you be awake! :3. Sleepy people tend to be very heavy at times!. Sleeping*
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!! . Hiking tomorrow morning?. ***Saturday I mean. Also should I meet you at Beeks?. Or pick you up?
Take a 1 credit class!!!. Some seminar?
Sort by number of credits!. Also, would you mind making a call for Beeks transport?
Sure, I'll give you a ride. I don't think your concerns are justified though.. If you were implying that your car is sketchy/suspicious?
Does that have something to do with terrorism?
Doesn't mean you should go out of your way to account for it. This is just how things are going to be now. Who knows how long it will lastm. Last*
I'll drive. But you don't have to be afraid of being convicted for having an old car.... I'm sorry you have to put up with that in your life. Can I help you fix it up somehow? We could get Scott to show us how to repaint it?
Or just send it to get a paint job. I think you could justify $200, but I have a feeling it would be more expensive
That takes us back to your bro!
https://blacksburg.craigslist.org/cto/5351267750.html super sketcky, but costs as much as a paint job? :P
New car thought?
Well good thing you're not too attached :P. Want to come to dinner with my mom and Ms. Alicia and me tomorrow at 7:30pm?
I understand. Good thing I didn't forget that part!. I'll let you know when later.
Where**
Want to make alfajores with me?. I finally brought the manjar back from my room!
Google !. They are really really good!!
http://globaltableadventure.com/recipe/chilean-alfajores/. This is the Chilean kind!. (:
Oh good!. It's perfect because I have so many eggs!
No, the recipe just calls for lots of egg yolks!
Yes, I'm safe!!
You got it!! Dragons tooth tomorrow? . Leave at 7am? I will pick you up!. Dress very very warm!!
Want to go horseback riding after at the spring valley farm place? :D!!!!
Bring some clothes to change into?. Gloves might be good!
Not a fan of the horseback riding?
But the hiking?
Well let me know when you know if you want to or not!. I just have to buy the groupon and then reserve a spot!
You don't want to?. How about ice skating?
Paintball?. I would way rather do horseback riding :P ... Hmm
Ice skating or horseback riding?
It'll be 44 degrees around the time of our ride tomorrow.. And sunny. Only 10 mph wind
Cold is nothing!. I'll buy you some hot hands!. What part of you is normally cold?. You can use my balaclava!. Or put hot hands in your shoes?
We can go buy warm things!. Borrow some long johns for the hike tomorrow!
Oh good!!
Wear some of those-- and wool socks if you have them.. I'll bring my balaclava for you...!. Or bring your beard hat for the horseback riding?
You can borrow my warm socks. Haha. So horseback riding yes???? :DD!!!!!
:D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Yes!!. I'll try and stick next to you during the ride!!!!!!!
No problem!. Did those cowboy boots fit you well?. :P They might be good for riding!!
Bad idea then.
Well I hear shoes with a heel are better for riding, but sneakers were fine last time!
Oh good!
Thank you for the quarters by the way! They are very cool!
Please pack a lunch tomorrow morning for yourself! I'll pack one too and we can share!. And eat a good breakfast!
Awesome!. Does your car work?. It's actually up Mt. Tabor Road if you'd like to drive over and park at the tiny school.. But I can drive you too if someone needs your car!
Okay! Just let me know if not and I will pick you up at 7am.
It's not much out of the way, I'll just pick you up!. Goodnight (:
Yay!! It's going to be so much fun!. You get to pick the activity afterwards!. Or for Sunday! . Please grab your med kit, if possible!
Doorknob
You're missing Honey Badgers!! 
Nature show?. I will probably stay. I'm sorry to have made you very sad!
Say thank you,  that would be great. Do you need any additional information to write the letter?
No, that was a suggestion of what to write him :P It would vary depending on the first email though. Good night!
Good morning!
I slept well! How did you sleep?
I hope you have a nice day too $!. !!*
Thank you!
I can get that back to you if you want!
Okay!
Well I'll get it back to you eventually!. And okay!
Not if it stays in the pantry!
Oh! What did you have in mind?
You can plan out today's activities since I picked the last ones!
Whatever you like!!
I just like when there's already a plan and there's no back and forth What do you want to do?. My contribution can be the cookies :P That could take about 2 hrs and we could watch a movie while we prepare it
Sure! I sort of lost the image for it though so would have to redownload. Is some other game a fine replacement?. Just surprise me!
Yes
It'd be so so awesome if you decided the movie and all the other activities today!!. My mom hasn't left yet, so no hurry!
I'd like to try making one ingredient banana once cream in your ice cream maker!! Unfortunately I had a ton of sweets this morning so won't be up for lots of sweets :P
Yes!!
Unfortunately I'm not so interested in watching TV or playing Earthbound, so I'm not sure if that leaves much! . You can come over at 2:30! Park at the tiny school if the Honda is still in the driveway! . Painting would be awesome!
We just had TV overload last night and I'd rather play a multilayer game than single player!. Don't you think so too?
That's fine! . Also, we can do cookie making tomorrow so they are fresher! (If you are free)
Were there any other activities you wanted to do?
What about what you'd like to do! . ?*. I only took out tv and single player games. Was that all you wanted? 
That doesn't really sound like a together activity
I'd just rather do something that couldn't be done apart . It just sounds like we'd both be working on computer tutorials next to each other. Any other things you want to do?
Is there anything on the itinerary already?
There was more than just tv watching and Earthbound, right?
The ice cream maker was fine (I suggested bananas). I can plan the day if you want-- I just thought you might like to get to decide what we do.
Watch TV and play earthbound?. Nah, but not doing just that doesn't limit us much!
The rest of the things you suggested sound fine!
That's something!. I'd love to use the daylight well it's still there.. It's past 2:30pm, still planning on coming?
Of course. Maybe we could play some bball?
Okay. Do you still have that free box of paints from the yard sale? All we need are yellow red and blue and a couple paintbrushes! I'll supply the paper
What other colors are in there?
okay. Bring your camera?
I can't wait to watch this!!
Pretty!! I see it
Merry Christmas,  Peter!
I love you too! 
Thank you! I hope 6ou spend some time with family!
Oh good! 
Aw, thanks!
I will be sure to watch it sometime!. What do you like about it?
That's interesting. I wonder what higher quality entails! More fps or you like the art style more or it is more detailed?. Well thank you for sending it!. Can I watch both without audio?. Or should I wait to watch. ?*
The first one is so great! It's like what I keep asking you to draw!  :P. Cute dogs!!
Haha, I mean cute animals in general! Like the kittens tumbling around and then falling asleep on each other. I'm glad he became less agressive like his mysterious guardian!
Nah, they each have a special place for me. 
There was more variety of poses and scenes and depth of character in the tiny nomad. What is the outdated study abroad class for?
Okay, neat! . Sweet dreams!
It's my pleasure!
Ahhh! You are a lamb face O.o. I think your hand slipped when cropping. Hmm, Interesting! . Merry Christmas morning! (:
No no no. I said that I would set that pic as your contact on my phone and then you joked I would just show the lamb, and then I laughed. And I also said you should use it as your profile pic (the picture of you and the lamb). I hope your morning is going well!!!
Nah, I don't think it's funny, but I'm sure you got a laugh out of someone!
Thank you for thinking of me though! . Do you think it would be funny if my profile picture were just a horse face?
Haha, I'll keep that in mind. How long is temporary?
Interesting.. What are you up to today?
I am reading my Jterm readings and painfully listening while my mom is explaining to Auntie Pat how to use her smart phone :P. That sounds really cool!!
It's not so bad :P
You thought right!
I know what I want to do for my site visit! https://recombu.com/digital/article/world-s-first-home-robot-shop-opens-in-paris
If they reopen in time!. :D !! Human robots!. humanoid*. Or maybe I'll go tour Paris Google
hehe :P. It's not open to the public though.... There are also some cool science museums!
Or I could just go to a nice park bench and people watch and then write about that!
Nah, that might be creepy.. I'm more interested in their behaviors then what they look like!
hehe. I'd be looking for inspiration, not drawing practice!. Thanks though (*:
Thank you!! I hope yours had been good too! Did you have a Christmas meal?
Hehe awesome!!!!!! :D . That's my Jewish friend's tradition!. That lamb is pretty cute!
Aw :D !! I have a nice picture of you on your birthday you can use!!. I think Christmas in China Town is a song!!. Well, a quick Google seach says not!!
Aw that is sweet! She's not going back til the 27th evening or 28th!. I for got to take out trash and run the disposal also :( Also trash day is tomorrow, but it should be fine!
That can wait!
I lub you! !!
Goodnight and sweet dreams!!!
Whoops, forgot to tell you to eat the curry :P
Oh good!! If you want it!!
I love you so so much, Peter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Nice talking to you! !! By the way, did any package come?
Oh good! (:. Thank you!
That's okay, I have had Pho three times this week, so it is very appropriate!
I just started my computer and it hadn't loaded all the other messages yet :P
You are wonderful silly! I'm sorry I missed it!. Sweet dreams (:
Oh cool! Quite new and wide toe area?
Did he hide them? :P. Also heel less than or equal to 1 inch?. I'd take 1.5 inches too maybe.. thanks for looking out for me!
If they're nice, then 15-20. That's so nice, thanks!. I'm at the terminal
You are super sweet and awesome amazing!!!. I love you!
Boarding shortly!. In line for boarding pass checks!
Games are like stories!. I'm on the plane now! Hooray! !. See you on the other side....!. (Of the ocean, that is)!
I am in London!. I ate a croissant! ^-^. And I found just the perfect sleeping position!. At the FIAP in Paris!
It could because I was leaning against the window!!. I was thinking I'll have time after my internship ends and before school starts to travel somewhere!!. Maybe cross country tripping?!
It will be fun!!
I envisioned you as my travel buddy!!. If you are up the the challenge!. For the*
Yes, I would love to sleep on you!
August 11th-22nd. Or fewer days if that doesn't work.. We could even go to Japan!
:D!. Is a week and a half enough time?. Well it is certainly better than nothing!
:P Haha I can only imagine a temporary residence at anywhere but the US. US citizen for life!
But world citizen at heart!. Because we are one
*hugs people of the planet*. How are you doing today?. What are you up to?
Oh cool! what about?. I'm doing well! Just taking a shower and reading
Oh :P I mean I am about to take a shower!!. :P
Well I hope you find your muse!. Maybe you should drink some tea ;P
Aww (: !!. I will gladly be your muse!. ^-^. Also, ttfn.. I'd better go shower now!
Sweet dreams to you for later!!. I love you so much!! You're an amazing boyfriend ^-^
10:16pm. Sleep tight, you!!. (Hug)
Good morning!!!!. I love you, Peter!!!!!!!
!!! (:
I love you!!. How is your day!?
My day is very good!!!!!. What did you do today?
"A story"?!. So ambiguous!. :P. Hard at work writing a story? :D. (: That sounds exciting!
Wow, you are so hardworking!. I walked around Paris!
Sorry! I transitioned to my phone because the typing on the laptop was too loud! . We went to Luxembourg Garden, then a fantastic lunch, then we visited Notre Dame, walked past the Louvre, saw the Arc de Triomphe, Ferris Wheel, Christmas market, and Effiel Tower. I felt very safe! I was not alone though!. I really like this group of people!! They are all so cool!!! One of the girls really cracks me up :P . Paris feels a lot larger than historic Rome and I am really liking it!!. I still haven't finished my readings though, so I will do that now! Sweet dreams to you (:
Yay, finished with readings! 
I keep wishing you were here!!. But another time...!
The polar bears and I are tight,  you know!!. Sweet dreams to you! (:
I must not be wearing my glasses... can't even recognize my own kind!!. Sleep tight (:
You should hang on to that, I think!!. (:. Good night :P
:D Why thank you!
:D I will let you know!
I look forward to hearing of your day tomorrow!. Oh!!. How was story writing?
Good night!! I love you too!! (:
That's okay!! (: It was quite the unusual hour and may have also been an accidental click!
Sleep tight! I hope you are having an awesome day!!
Thank you!! That is appreciated!
You're awesome but I need to sleep! !. Good night (:
No lock! :P But I like the locks!
Sleep tight!
I like looking at them, but probably not doing it :P. Nightnight!. Unless you want to!
A relationship is more than a lock!
(:. Om! Got to hang with that girl today! She is pretty cool and knows Korean? !?!
Just had to share.
Noo.. oh my!!!
She made me laugh so much that I was basically dying 
Or er... something like that :P. Haha, you can!!
I hope so too, but I am bad at friends
O.o I will see what happens!!. :D 
I love you!! 
Loose lips sink ships!. Night night (:
Haha, solid advice!
Good morning Peter!!! (:
Hello!!! Happy New Year's Eve!! 
Thank you !!!. Nice talking to you!! I love you too (:. Sleep tight!
Oh yeah!! (: Have an awesome day then!!
I hope you do too!!
Happy New Year to you too!!. Argentina s are so friendly!!
Argentinians*
Yes, like the whole hug/kiss sound thing. I think I've warmed up to it after Chile! 
That is how you say Happy new Year!!. It is a kiss sound beside your face. When you go to a Spanish speaking culture, or one comes to you, it is how you meet someone too!
greet* not meet. One arm hug and kiss sound beside their face. I think other Europeans do it too!. Like I said, I have gotten used to the culture
Hehe, it's nice. It's sort of like how relatives you don't see all the time greet you.. Like you're family!
:D. I love you!!. Feliz ano nuevo..!. I will be asleep when it happens to you!. Sweet dreams to you! (:
Hehe :P Well I will give you a New Year's kiss when I see you (:. Whoa, so this girl also has a Polaroid camera o.o!!
No, it's just something neat!! Happy New Year!!
Yes! (Not the Polaroid )
Sleep tight!!
How was your new years?
Making resolutions is like celebrating!
Wow, it has such a low resolution!. :P
I was trying to make a pun :P. I hope you have a great day too!. I should have said.. "that's such a low resolution". Well not a pun, but a double meaning?
I love you too!!! (;. Have a wonderful sleep!. (:. Bye!
Hi hi!! How are you?. I love you!
I'm doing really well!!. Had lots of fun!!!
That is one of my friends! I also got to spend tons of time with cool girl!!!. :D Less sleep but more fun! !. Goodnnight!!. Which things?. Good morning!
Hello!!. I love you too, Peter!! (:. What are the some things?
Oh no, which ones?
?? Why is that concerning?
Commercials, in the store, etc
Why?
Is something bad about that?
It was even mentioned in health class
Good as usual!!. I got to play ping pong with cool girl!. And walked around with a different cool girl!. :P haha. How was your day?
Hehe!!
Sounds like a fun day so far! Did that take up all your time?. Oh! Do you like those?
Oh neat!
I like them,  but I don't prefer them over fresh food
That's okay. Thanks for sharing your concerns!
Thank you! !!. Sweet dreams to you too!
^-^!!. Sleep tight! 
I slept in today! You can catch me in the evening (:
Hello!. I hope you are having a great day!!
What are you up to?. My day was great! Although cold--I was a bit silly walking in the rain without an umbrella!
I don't have one :P. I decided not to pack it. Sounds like a good idea though!
That's super nice, but I think my mom has one she can pack! I can also buy a poncho pretty easily!
:D I think I know the one!
That's fine! I appreciate it though!
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too! I miss you too!
Oh man, I'll watch out!!
I love you too!!! :D. The bread is noticeably crisper here!!. I eat croissant for breakfast!!. And I had a crepe !! Yum!
I bet they are! Especially if you have a roller?!. Sleep tight! (:
Good morning!
I did! Thank you! Sweet dreams to you (:
Suspenders for you? :D
Oh, did you like any of those?
Just H&M!
I'm not! It is free for your viewing!. I am searching for street pianos!. There used to be one here
Streetpianos.com. Is that a recent article?
That's the one!. I found one so far!
I have been all along the 14th arrondissment and am heading to Shakespeare and Co now. We toured the opera garnier. Orthodontist? 
Neat!
Not necessarily . Just different
I found a piano!! Right by Note dame
Goodnight!! (:
Sweet dreams! 
I love you very much! 
It is so good! (:
Writing metro poems, eating at the highest restaurant in Paris!
Went to the Victor Hugo museum.. What was that other relationship slang?. That you learned from Molly?
Thank you!!
I was explaining to a friend :P
Haha, like what? :P. What was your day like?
Oh yeah, that could be possible!
What are your duties? 
Entries?*. That sounds pretty good!
Don't forget to add like applying for a job. :P 
Oh, which job are you looking at? :D
Probably look at a job description first otherwise you don't know what your portfolio should look like. Also you might not need a portfolio for all the jobs you are applying to.. Just makes it easier on yourself.
Well dude, you've got a great portfolio already, I think you just need to start interviewing.
Maybe preparing for interviewing. And also it's going to be tough if you don't even know where to apply. Your online one looks great. Just start by finding a place to apply. Then figure out the application steps.. It can really psych you out and cause you to not even start looking until it's too late if you think you need to keep making projects to apply for a job. At this point, it's all you
That makes sense, but the think about how exciting applying for jobs could be!! You can go anywhere you set your mind to!. think*
Even Japan if you wanted!. Just takes some research and application!. Anywhere your heart desires! The world is your treasure!. *steps off stump*
What is the description and prof. Ratings?
That sounds nice. What are the consequences of not taking a full course load?. I think I saw that it is some amount of money less to be part time enrolled 
Maybe it's a better deal to take 11 credits? . That's what I'm suggesting, but depending on your student loan conditions, some of them start accumulating interest once you are no longer full time enrolled. Is that true of yours?
But the amount of interest could still be less than the extra money it costs for going into the next price range. But then maybe your parents couldn't use you for taxes? Lots of factors at play...
$4904 for 12-18 credits and $3394 for 1-11 credits . $1500 more just to take that extra class :O. Hold on a sec, let me double check this.. that seems off
Jk you only save 500 dollars. How much were you making from work study?
Do you get scholarships?
Sorry, too personal?. Financial aid is just in loan form? I didn't think they were very stingy on those
Your parents might know best regarding taxes, but 500 dollars is still something to think about!
Goodnight!
Thank you! We have another surprise tomorrow!. Have an awesome rest of your day!
Good morning!
Awww (:
I love you too!! Good night!
It made me think of you!
You should be estatic then!
The last 4 are yesterday 's restaurant . Mmm, what kind of cereal?. The fish was cooked to perfection!
Hehe!!. Speaking of good chefs... I can't help thinking of Ratatouille while I am here!
Thanks!! I hope your day continues to go well too!
I wish you luck on the dangerous mission ahead!
Goodnight!! (: I love you too!.  But really.. suspenders?. :P. My head stand is potentially improving!
Did any of the patterns look like something you'd want?
Good night!
Very good! And you?
What's wromg.? 
Okay, why not so great day?
Sleep tight!! (:
I hope you have a nice day too!. What did you ahev to do instead of what you wanted? 
Hmm, well you didn't know it would be a failure when you set out to it! Would it have been time well spent if you had been successful? 
:P . :D I like the people on this trip very much! 
Especially Kelsie and Samantha ^-^ 
I hope I can hang with them back at UVa!. We'll see...!. So cool though! !!!!!!!!
Haha :P Or sushi!
It's so crazy how different a place is from what you imagine. It's like Paris was in a cloud at first, and I'm slowing uncoving parts. uncovering*. I can form pictures in my head of each of the places I've traveled . And it's so different than just pictures... (not that I looked at many pictures of Paris anyway :P)
I want to go to all the places.. I have a list of countries!. Switzerland, Spain, Greece, Japan... lots!
On the 9th, but my final paper is due on the 12th!. New Zealand to swim with Humpback whales. On my list!
I just need a travel buddy and a job that allows me to travel often !. Yes!
Thanks! Are you up for many travel, lots of walking, and learning new languages? . Travels*
And the occasional skydiving and scuba diving?. Oh good!!!!! I am glad you will be getting some travel experience before Japan!!!. When are you going?
What's stopping you?
It's just $1000 or less for the air ticket, if your board would be covered!. Just use the adventure fund
Book way in advance with a cheaper $600 round trip flight. I think those exisit!. Just don't make money a problem! Because when you're old you'll have money but you won't have the body or the time. Now you can be poor and have adventure !!!!. Which is way better in my opinion!!. I can't wait to ride a camel. Across a stretch of desert. Or see giraffes roaming free!. :D *travel crazy*. Now I'll be restless back in CVille
I plan to dive into Japanese and to keep up my music and breakdancing!. I will street preform one day...
Sure you want this?
This life
Self teaching from downloaded materials
I may not either, but two years at a place like Google could probably fund me for 5 years (living my dream to fund my other dreams!!). I haven't gotten them yet, but I was going to use bittorrent. Utorrent**. So happy ^-^. Dude
You're part of why I'm happy!. Travelling is only fun with good company!!!
Do you mean you?
They are! But I meant you!. Funding two people will be tougher, however
Sweet! . That's a lot!
But what about your student loans, man?
You're almost out there... !
That sounds good! You should probably be eating better than that though! Also, car insurance, income tax, real life stuff :P 
Also, don't pick the job based on money--do what you like and money will follow!. Sweet dreams! Sleep tight!
My bad, thanks for listening to my musings
Good morning! !
Thank you!! You too!
Sweet dreams to you!
Hi!. Just about to go out to dinner at Chatomat!. I hope you are having a better day!
Thank you! Le Fooding. :P
It's a new culinary movement1. !*
Ttfn (:
I am here! (:. Going back on the metro now!
What are you doing?
Oh, what would you rather do?
I will be working on my paper before bed so I will sort of be around!
Hehe, instead, I cuddled with the FIAP cat, and now going to sleep!
I'm staying at the FIAP, and there is a cat that hangs out in the lobby and 1st floor!
No, I'm already spoiled and appreciative of life! But I am happy with or without the food!. As long as I am getting my nutrition!. It's a nice once in a while experience. Sleep tight, you!!
I love you!
Good morning!. I have investigated memories already...! It is somewhat helpful, but I think a self study book supplemented by chats with a student learning Japanese will be more helpful!
No worries, thank you!
Thank you!! 
Tomorrow morning!
What did you do instead?
I cannot remember!!
:#D. This one tastes so good!
A thousand layers pistachio cream cake!
Om nom nom! 
I will check out the ones that Ari (our prof) recommended, but that I haven't been to yet!
I still have so many assignments to do tomorrow :P whoops
I will work on it (:. I have to create a metaphor for Paris! 
No, I'm in the English section. I am thinking of saying it is like the optometrist. You have to combine a lot of lenses to see it clearly.
Well I don't mean that it has the same feel as visiting the optometrist, I mean that the lens as a metaphor is a good way of describing how one can begin to understand Paris.. There is the lens of the tourist, and the lens of the wanderer, the lens of the resident, and all these combine to give a clearer picture of what Paris actually is. The solitary lenses are all just blurred views 
We are one course, but  French students to their assignments in French. Yes, it could be. My experience of Paris in particular lends itself to this because we learned more about the city each day and explored the city in new ways . I didn't have this sort of experience with Rome or Hong Kong or Bangkok though -- I was always on the tourist side of that. Some places, like Malaysia, don't really have a large tourist lense either. . There might be a more fitting metaphor that demonstrates what I'm trying to say about lenses and is more specific to Paris
It does, thank you so much 
Kelsie is so cool! !!. :D!!!
If she would want to!. I totally got her snapchat!. She so cool...!. :D. You don't even know~~
Haha, I guess I will
I have been sending some out!
Mine are not so personalized :P . Just pics and video, no text!. I'm going to get to sleep now! Good night!  (:
Sweet dreams (:
Did you ever listen to My Chemical Romance?
Ahh, Kelsie was singing it, so cool!!!!!. I'm jamming to it now :P. Middle school flashbacks
Haha, no, you can still be cool and not like the same music!. I will stop raving though, it will get annoying quickly!. :P
Noo, I mean raving about Kelsie's coolness
You got it!. Sleep tight (:
Thank you (:
Seminal years nonetheless. Goodnight!!
I really like the song "Dead!". I got so excited when it came on!. What sad things?. I'd love to talk openly about this stuff one day. Would that not be normal?. I have talked to you about it, but it makes you feel uncomfortable?. Disenchanted is a more mellow one...! . At least for the beginning...?. I probably tried to play this for you in the past :P. Night night!
Me talking about past relationships with boys?
You have been nice enough to listen to it in the past, but I guess it's not your favorite topic!
Yes, the boys of Leandra's past. You know of them all already
Well I had a crush on a certain Daniel. And a friendship with a boy Max (and he may have asked me out and we were dating??? for a very short time)
And then there is Edward/Lawrence. This is middle school, no big deal, but fun to talk about!
And not forgotten. But closured
Sleep tight, you!. (: Closure indeed!
I want you. . Night night! :3
Goodnight!! (My phone keeps buzzing when you message o,o)
Night! (Last one for now)
Oh no, dude, what's wfong?. Not enough human interactions?
Keeping things to yourself sounds like a bad idea!
Hmm, why the feeling?
My last message wouldn't send...
Trying to take a screenshot, but I'll just retype it!. You're definitely the fit! I'm not the kind to be deceptive like that if I knew there wasn't any potential long term relationship. I just applied for techhacks and mchacks!. In case you were curious!. Sweet! Most loans don't start collecting interest if you are enrolled at least "half-time".. So it's seeming like a better deal just to be part-time enrolled?. You should still be able to get a loan...
Boots?! . You can sign up only if you would like to go and do a hack :P. They are in California and Canada, respectively!
You would be great company!. Always need graphic designers!. Wow, you got the riding boots?!. That is cool!
Weekends in February I think!
http://hacktech.io/. I had the name wrong!
If you like!. First things first... essay... and then learning Japanese! (well, I should start with linear algebra)
What is your day like?
Oh! What sorts of poems?!. I'm interested in lots of categories!
I really enjoyed writing metro poems!. We should exchange poetry sometime.
Poetry can't not be good! It's like art!. It varies :P
I just put "Other", and then listed the name of the university as instructed!. http://radford.edu/~pmattox2/Portfolio/. You know it's bad when you forget your own domain name! :P. Not sure what "it" is in this case
It's a good one! What did you come up with?
Haha :P
You and your friend have obviously run into this problem before, so now that they've been through it, the sock should be a giveaway
I would break one side of the glasses frame and use the sharp edge to write on the glasses lens "Be back at 10pm".  I would make this more visible by melting ice around it (the water would magnify it). I would shape the sock into an arrow by knotting one end, so that my friend would know to look at the glasses lens.
Hey, they're not my glasses.. :P
Meh, glasses!. :P
I must not appreciate them enough since I wear contacts!. But I thought the Be back at 10pm was more urgent than the glasses.
This is McGyver life or death, Peter!
You know what I'm saying.. ^-^
Whatever you like! I didn't even expect to receive boots. Maybe I should see if they fit first before you go to the extra trouble!
That seems demeaning!
Hmm, maybe you're right. Well, I can probably polish my own shoes if you show me how!. So let's hear that poem!. I'll trade you mine!. One of the ten
Thank you! I could definitely borrow all of those.. Here is one from 01/04: "Breach the silence, speak your mind. Orange triumph, bright with pride. Under the curtain call, you hear your name. Align your senses, know the game. Seek the change and it will come. Follow your mark like the burning sun. Though oft endangered, never waver. Spirits high and heaven save you. Forge your path with kindness and you'll find the best in others."
And another from 01/04: "Arctic weather bring me back to foreign skies. Everything in the city reminds me of your eyes. Couples passing say goodbye. Search the meadows, find your lucky charm These ember waves can't keep us from the ground. From lines of action to disarray, we walk the city every way. Elder compass, take me home, my heart will be your metronome. Save your breath, the name is yours. I'll keep my secret if you keep yours.". There's plenty more where that came from :P. 01/06: "Send my best, approach the fall. Learn to trust, but know when to call. I'll take your lemons and trade you a smile. Wind blows through windows, feeds the fire in my soul. Piano daydreams... my fingers aspire to black and white, but the rhythm finds me unprepared. What hidden wonder fills the air? Alive and well, I wish you well."
Unknown, they are just thought of very quickly between metro stops, so it's right off the top of my head!
It's possible!
However many you write, you're welcome to keep them private, too.. I just wanted to share because I am proud of my poetry!
Thanks! I might do a digital format
Anyway you can photoshop our professor in front of the effiel tower?
If it takes more than 15 minutes, maybe don't bother!. :P. Hehe, it's more of a suggestion.
No :P It would be a joke picture
students :P
Yes... probably just a stock image of the effiel then?  http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/5358802-3x2-940x627.jpg
Up to you! It's just for laughs, so it's not a big deal. And it's fine if you'd rather not also!
Not sure which would look better as the background...
Also, summer might not be so accurate..
Hehe, the selfie stick is key here
the selfie stick is missing. Probably also crop out Sam's face :P
Haha, sweet!!
Thank you :P. I will post it now...
Never tired of them!. :D Yes, it looks great!
Thanks :P
No, it's just an unconfident acceptence... Should it be more like...  Thanks! (;. ;)
Kelsie is in the front! She's awesome!
:D!! I can't wait til school starts and maybe we will hang out together!. hehe, I sound creepy :P
So true!. I'll snapchat Leyla my Chinese food once it comes! :D. I ordered takeout :P
I hope so!. Peking duck and jellyfish salad!. I better work more on my discussion posts and MyMaps.... I'll write my paper tomorrow :P
It's not due until Tuesday!. Bye for now!. I love you too!
It is a short description of my site project and a pin on  the maps page 
Before school starts!
I enjoyed it!
No worries!!. "Photoshop level 100" someone said :P
Haha, I hope not.
I am happy!!. And no, the first round of admissions has already passed, so I've been auto bumped to the 2nd round.. Dude :3. http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/The_f721bf_352534.jpg. Haha, I just got a blast from the past of my neopet days.... Want to see?. http://s19.photobucket.com/user/pupz20/library/?sort=3&page=1. password: yoyoyo. MS Paint Level 1. Sleep tight!
What did you think? :D. Pretty magnificent legacy, eh?
That was back when I was interested in being a graphic designer!. Would you prefer some calling? I could get skype up and running for tonight!. New profile picture for you? :P Just needs some touching up and cropping...!. Whoops, accidentally happened twice!. Looks kind of like Pop art!
The thumbs up was an accident :P. And I always found it a bit tedious :P
If you like it that is good!
What does studio management consist of?. Also, that is a nice poem!. A bit somber, though
That sounds interesting! Did the professor used to manage an art studio? (Does the art studio contain only your works of art or also other artist's works?). And yes, today I went around Paris with my Mom!. What have your last couple days been like? (:
I mean, what sort of studio are you learning to run?. Also, how does an art studio make money? From sales perhaps?. Also, what is meant by "writing proposals"?
The class seems interesting, but different than what I thought you wanted to do as a career (thought I'm actually not sure what that is)
Also, if you are running the show, who are you sending the proposals to? (who would be higher up than you if you are self-employed)
Oh, probably proposals to venture capitalists/funding groups?
http://visualartists.ie/the-manual-a-survival-guide-for-visual-artists/presenting-your-work/preparing-proposals/
It's good to know what you're getting into before you find out it's not so interesting!
Many different things to propose..!
Especially if I become an investor.. David Bowie <3
I didn't even know he had cancer or that he just released an album.. But I did like his Labyrinth songs!
His musics will live on in your heart!!. Hmm, nothing says friendship like perusing someone's Facebook profile :P Probably not the best approach...
hehe, Kelsie :P
Nah. But she is pretty cool!. And I miss all the people after hanging out with them for two weeks.
I plan to get Kelsie the Paris beanie she was looking for and then deliver it to her somehow?. And I will visit Samantha at the art museum (since she is a docent)!. And I'll hang out with Linda over the summer in McLean!. And I can practice Japanese with Kelsie if I get good enough!
I guess you could come along to give Kelsie the hat with me if you wanted!. :P. But I don't think that's what you meant....
Oh no, what is wrong?
What is that?. Lack of human interactions?
What do you mean by that?
Well I have plans that do involve you too. Not all my plans involve you--then we would just be like the same person!
There's a reason I like your company!
You're a unique person though. No one can be exactly like you!. It's like.. physics!
Meh, philosophicalness is nonessential-- being caring and fun makes for a pretty awesome boyfriend.. Ambition is good but too much is not.  A want to travel is a must if you are to be my travel buddy!. Or just a willingness to do a lot of walking and new situations!. Just avoid being jobless and you're golden ^-^
Well no pressure on the job thing--it's ideal, but if you have other plans too, that's fine!
May we talk more?. It seems unresolved.
It starts with a problem...!. And then the solution?. And understanding each side
I will probably be free the weekend of 30th-31st!. And free the 18th and 19th if I find a ride to Cville. (otherwise I am being dropped off in Charlottesville on the way back from the airport). And are you still up for Spring Break scuba diving?
It's a real concern in life in general!. (dying). Well it is expensive to get certified, so if you wouldn't enjoy it, then it might not be so good.
Sweet dreams to you!. (:
I will be paper writing tomorrow!. Sleep tight!
hehe "easier than it will be?". Have an awesome rest of you day and good night (:. Guess I never really heard what you were up to!. Feel free to let me know when you get back!. Bye!
Good morning!
Qui, Monsieur!
No, qui, I still want compliments!. Je t'aime! No need to be formal with me!
You are familiar to me ^-^
Sweet dreams to you (:
Ommm! What was it?
That doesn't sound like nothing to me! :D
How was the company?
Don't worry! But it helps to keep busy!. I hope you have a great sleep!
Seems avoidable
If I treated my boyfriend like that, then you'd better break up with me by then. :P That sounds terrible
Well focus on your dream job, because tech companies are practically everywhere!
http://www.google.com/about/careers/locations/. No way, I want us to each live at our own place for at least a year, but we will still be hanging out together during that time!
Not bits at a time--probably a lot since I like you!!!. I think having your own place is an important part of life and moving in together too soon, especially before being financially stable can tend to cause arguments and problems and etc.. So you and I should totally have our own places coming out of college!. Plus, I'm in school for another year (or year and a half) anyway!
Or whatever you want to do!
Nah, I haven't had any. Just mulled wine that has all the alcohol boiled out (I didn't like the taste though!).. https://www.digitgaming.com/careers/job-listings/. Dude, there are so many jobs out there!!. Curious where you will go!
Have I vanished?. Ireland does sound cool!. But really, so many places...!
Don't bother with the coding if you just want to do the art! :D
Coding is more important for "web" graphic designers!
Find a computer science major to work with you!
Put an ad out on the Radford page perhaps
Not silly. It's wise to settle an "ownership of work" contract if you are serious about the product
I'm just writing my paper :P. I love you too ^-^ !. Have a wonderful sleep!
:D !. I hope it warms up for you!
Oh good!
Yes!
Oh whoops, it's been awhile since I have opened skype!
?!!!. :D!. Thank you ^-^
Well hello there!!. I love you too ^-^ ! Thanks for being so supportive!
I finished this morning!
It was not so bad to write! (:. How is your day?
:O*
That's very neat!. What were you up to in Radford besides that?
Whoa!! How is it?. Oooh, homework already? :D
Ooh, restricted zones?. Any roof tops?. Or bodies?!
How is the view?
That sounds like a fun time!!. Memrise and Genki are super helpful! If I keep it up, I should be able to make sentences by the time school starts! 
I think I will avoid Kanji though. Yes, it was that fluent in 6 months video :P
It's just too many symbols :P. Torrented. Sweet dreams to you (:
I can send you the book!. You need a Japanese friend to practice with!
Find the Japanese students! :P. Sweet dreams!. (:
I love you too! . Wow, lots of Greg Laswell
Your story ends in Goodbye?. I hope you sleep well...!~
No, I can think of many stories that don. 't. Unless it is the story you are saying goodbye to.
I'm on the move!. Sunrise over the city!
They are cute! (:
How is your day going? (:
My day is going very well!
We are heading back to the apartment. I am learning my katakana and hiragana
I have 16 hiragana and 7 katakana. Lots more to go. . I'm using memrise
Thank you!! It's so cool how little time it takes to know so much more about the language!
If it's a thing you want to do ("
Definitely. .although I hear the country is very good to English speakers. Mandarin is probably more useful overall :P
I went to memrise and downloaded hiragana and katakana
I have it from the android app store. Thank you so much for doing that!!. Can you use it on the web?
We are back on Monday, so checking on Friday or Sat. Is fine if you're able!!. Thank you a bunch!. I am halfway through hiragana!!
 Then I will be able to sound out words ish..
After katakana. That sounds good!
I did, thanks!! It's not really in order though. And I found it difficult to remember all the characters. Now it will be a lot easier!. They have good memory tricks for the symbols!
The YouTube video was kind of funny. But advice from me? Persistence, repetition, practice 
Thank you!. This is super addicting $. !*
Neko is cat! (:
:D Got them all... now on to katakana!
;P
Thank you! Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!! (:
(:
Come what may :3. Have an awesome rest of your day! 
They will find me eventually!. Wow, lots of YouTube and links lately
Nah,it's fine-- but it would help if you said something about the thing
Well thank you!!
Sleep tight!
Sleeping more now ^-^. I had that teeth falling out dream, so I'm glad I don't have to go to the dentist!!
I will live without the pants! :P. Definitely climbing Notre Dame today, and then whatever my Mum wants to do!
Not intentionally, what did I miss?
Oh, I see the followup now.. I find your lack of confidence perplexing and difficult to respond to!. Not to mention the accusatory and assuming nature of it
It's all okay. I'm going to go shower and breakfast now!  Sweet dreams
No need to be sorry! There is probably something I could be doing better for you too
Oh I still have violent tackle tendancies, don't worry!!. Goodnight, you
Self defense would be fun!. Of course you are cute but it's all about your attitude and confidence, so of course I find you cuter when you are happier and more yourself!. I asked him for some advice about what to do in Paris, but it doesn't make me want to talk to you any less
Good morning!
Hehe, I get it!. I was feeding tiny birds today!! They are so cute!
Do you have skinny suspenders already!. ?*. They have maroon too!
Woo, I finished katakana!. How are you?
Hah, but I won't know what any words mean... I'm very good!
Good night and sweet dreams to you too!!
I hope your day goes well too!!
This memrise is really great..! Genki I (Genki I) Vocabulary & Kanji
Good night!!. (:
Oh whoops, can you see all that?. ^-^. Hehe. What are you up to?
Oh!! Enjoy!. It's actually exotic willow, but I'm glad you noticed!
I love you!. Have an awesome day!
Whoa whoa whoa!!!!. Ice skating at PennApps...!!!
Am I missing something?. I like raccoons, thank you very much. They can play with the pots and perform a musical
Princess Diaries moment.. That raccoon bit is new.. Have fun in class!. (:. Bye, Peter!
Haha :P!!! Well I will be contemplating.... Ttfn (:
It should notify them automatically since it gets registered/attached to your driver's license? . Off is probably better!. And that's nice, but your class starts on Tuesday, and I am heading back to CVille from DC on Monday, so I'd better just stay there!
That's strange. Didn't it go on the online record already?
I never had to do anything with my certificate . When I registered for the course, I signed up with my driver's license 
Enticing, maybe.. but what's another two weeks?
Nah, only because I would feel bad you have to drive 5 hours just to see me for a couple!
Noo, it sounds crazy. Just get a head start on school work or something!. And that was for a longer visit. Didja decide to stick with 11 creds?. Credits*
Might as well take an actual course since it costs an extra 500! :3. Something super useful
Do they not have any problem with you only taking 11 credits and just paying more?. Kind of confusing. Anyway, I hope it works out with what you want!
I better get to sleep!. Have a good rest of your day!
Today was, I'm flying tomorrow 
Oh I Get it!. Goodnight!
Dooitashimashite?. What does that mean?. Ohh, interesting
Use iie instead
Sweet dreams (:. Exactly!
Yup
I see you haven't been studying :P
But yeah, something like that $. !*. Byebye!
Jaa mata!. (Japanese keyboard is hard )
Good morning!!. Off to PHilly!
Made it to Philly!. Japanese is really cool!!
Hello!
Sweet dreams to you too!
Oh! What is the oddity?. I love you (:
Thanks you!. Oh, I get it!
It is going well! Just getting ready for the drive to Charlottesville!. How is your day going?. Grocery shopping in store? :D. I'm making a list!. Are you free from May 8th to June 5th?
Oh, maybe the 13th--I may have exams up until then, but I could probably request to take them earlier. And nah, but it's super easy to reset your card, and you should totally put that money into savings so it can accumulate. I have a .9% Apr with discover, so I can put it in there as long as you keep track of the sum
Yeah! Also, it's super easy to reset your PIN through Capital One 360 (and then you just call the 800 number on the back to get them to unlock your card). I had to do it in France and it was so quick!. https://helpcenter.capitalone360.com/bnk/Topic.aspx?category=PIN3. Super easy. So, you'd better get your passport :P. I'm thinking Japan and New Zealand?. Or Australia. Flights are still expensive O.o. I snapchat with Kelsie ^-^
Sweet! How much?. Want to go skydiving?
No way!
It's won't cover everything, but it will help!
ATM?
Don't worry!. Also, you should be eating healthily!. You know, if you want
Oh, cool!. ATMs don't accept coins. We can do Capital One 360 P2P. I'll send you my info tomorrow!. Japanese is addicting!
haha :P
Oh, send me your schedule!. :D !
Sweet! Do you have one of those Calendar view versions? I'll send you a screenshot of mine. Looking forward to Modern ARt?. Looks like we're heading out now, so I will talk to you later!. I hope you have an awesome day!
I got real almonds instead!. (:
It is nice! Thank you!
I have the Genki stuff for you!. But the file size is too big o.o
dropbox is good!
It's great being home! :D
Oh yum!!
It's layers of ricotta and meat and pasta?. And maybe spinach?
Yum!!. Pstt.... https://www.facebook.com/events/467288533478669/
Oh yeah, that is a Wednesday :P. Well if one of my friends happens to be going.... I'll mark myself as "interested" just in case
:D. I'll keep that in mind for other concerts
Like skydiving?
:D. Will you be ready to drive down to Florida by March 5th?
Oh good!!. (:
Different times!
You can hold on to it for now!. Have a safe drive to Radford!
I love you too!
Goodnight! That is pretty amazing! . Take a picture :P. Of the adventure fund.. to keep for potential scrapbook purposes!
https://drive.google.com/a/virginia.edu/file/d/0B8ytVN7EwcWFSmdtVUFFdjVkb2s/view. Tell me when you've finished downloading so I can delete it!. Also, have a super awesome time in classes tomorrow!
Oh whoops :P. https://www.facebook.com/events/1512162422419608/. What's your gmail?
Thanks. I shared it with you--try again!
I just thought it was cool!
I"m not sure what that weekend has in store for me yet!. Sweet dreams, I've got an early day tomorrow! :D
Figure skating practice!
That's nice of you to think of me!. They were white and all?
Neat! Jackson is a good brand.. and Lake Placid and Riedell. Anywho... Sweet dreams! (:. We're not so close to a frozen lake, so owning skates isn't too important
Sleep tight!
Good morning! . Thanks for the update!. Enjoy your portfolio prep and modern art!
Hehe, but classes are tomorrow so you've got that!. And awesome!!. I mean you've got my schedule!. https://www.insidejapantours.com/blog/2015/11/03/in-miyazakis-footsteps-5-destinations-for-ghibli-fans/. Ideas for the Japan trip.
The best travel backpack? (carry on sized). http://www.amazon.com/Osprey-Farpoint-40-Travel-Backpack/dp/B00NQW1AXU/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8. Or this one which is less expensive! http://www.amazon.com/Kelty-Redwing-44-Backpack-Black/dp/B00AATRU8G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1453220841&sr=8-2&keywords=kelty+redwing
These are like everything backpacks.. Like no suitcase traveling!. That's what I'm planning for ^-^
Are you up for such a trip?. Guys tend to be pretty good at packing light
Oh good!@
We will get together one weekend to do the planning!
^-^
Oh good! What are you going to do for the rest of the day?
Haha, homework sounds good! :D. The budget works out, so we are good to go to Japan!. It's like 5K, but I got it, dude.. I mean, not dude? (I remember you commented on this)
Ah, make that 6K -- forgot to factor in activity money :P. But hopefully we'll mostly do hiking and free stuff. And maybe an amusement park, a scuba dive, and museums and things!. Florida Keys trip comes to 2K
(scuba diving is a bit of an expensive hobby :P)
I think it's totally worth it to travel though, because I have time now, and I might not later!
Hmm, I'll have to think about that one.. :P
Of course I want you along!! (:
And not just for lack of options.. (even though I do have lack of options). (I'm being totally reassuring, right?)
Yeah, I guess so, but I wouldn't feel so comfortable with anyone else!. Plus, you totally get the whole spartan traveling thing (I think). Because we're not going to be staying anywhere extravagant, and there will be a lot of walking. I will factor in some extra money for the food budget though!!!. Can't skimp on Japanese food :P
Do you think $30 a day is realistic?. for two people?
Ah, that seems to be the figure for per person.. So I'll account for $60/day, but maybe we can eat some grocery store food too, if possible
Whoops, that puts me a bit negative... I'll buy the plane tickets on a 0% APR Credit card, and then that'll work!. hehe, that show is still a mystery to me!
Kelsie recommended the K drama, Boys Over Flowers to me :P
Awesome! ^-^ !!. Asian languages are way less intimidating after being introduced to Japanese!. How does this place look?. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9615508?checkin=03%2F09%2F2016&checkout=03%2F11%2F2016&guests=2&s=EuSeAHJ_. I realize I better book soon, because everywhere is filling up!
It's a big bed?
There's no bathroom on the boat, but it says there is one a short walk away
This one is the same price! https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4567531?checkin=03%2F07%2F2016&checkout=03%2F11%2F2016&guests=2&s=MLP4FqMS. Sounds better?
Nah, but the property sounds better perhaps?. I'm really looking for that oceanfront beach/kayak access. We could stay somewhere cheaper like this for the days we are learning scuba diving, and then move to the place with amenities! https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5394522?checkin=03%2F06%2F2016&checkout=03%2F08%2F2016&guests=2&s=o5HmOwDC
Whoa, totally didn't realize it is 2hours between key west and key largo... Hmm
Some tripadvisor forums say Key West is more for "tropical flair and activities", but Key Largo is better for marine life and quiet.. We could stay in Key Largo, and take a few day trips?
What activities are you looking forward to? (can be anywhere on the way down to Florida, and also anywhere in the Keys!
http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34599-d1848903-Reviews-St_Augustine_Wild_Reserve-Saint_Augustine_Florida.html. I think I tend to prefer nature/hiking/animals!!
:P We will see. Safe to book just in Key Largo? Not sure if we would want to stay in Florida for one night. (I'm planning on staying somewhere halfway down the coast the first and last nights, but it's still up in the air where!)
I'm looking at all the green places near the path of travel!
http://cumberlandisland.com/. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This one!!
No, they are wild horse!. And sea turtles and armadillos...!!!. Sounds like my kind of place!. What about you?
They have camping!. :P. If you are up for the tough life
And manatees?. No, sappy is nice!
And the everglades of course!. I hope we see manatees ^-^
Would you want to do hiking/camping a couple days?
Whoa, like fishing and then eating the fish?
We could order our travel backpacks in advance and use them for hiking/camping!
Probably, beacause there are so many other places I would think to go first!. I did some research and found that 46L and under are suitable for carry-ons on airplanes. Keltey redbird 44L is a good choice!
But he's in Germany now!. I'm going to get a Redbird 44L. Most likely!. Redwing***
I understand, I was just messing with you :P. When are you done with class on 3/5?. 3/4**
I've got class til 3/4 at 11:15am
Cool. I would drive to Blacksburg for about 2 hours.
That's possible, but you'd be backtracking for 1.5 hours. It's probably easier for me to drive to Blacksburg
Nah, that's fine!
I'll be back there before long
You could always buy the camping foods!
Would you be up for sleeping in a car to save $50? :P. Or is that too much?
It's going to be 60s, I think!
40s at night... no big!
No, I meant like.. "No big deal". I think it's slang
Oh, I would most definitely like a sleeping bag
Hmm, we'll see!. So.. 3/4 is for driving and stay some place, then 3/5 is camping at Cumberland Island, then 3/6 is driving to the Everglades and stay some place, 3/7 is camping/hiking the Everglades, then 3/8-3/12 is staying at Key Largo, then 3/12 night we will stay some place off the highway, then we will return on 3/13!
Does that sound good to you?
Whoa, too much researching/looking at the computer screen o.o
Maybe we should stay at Cumberland for two nights?
I should sleep :P. ^-^ Sweet dreams to you!
Good morning!. What is the matter?. Kelty Redwing 50 seems like a better deal!. Enjoy Watercolor today!
Oh yeah! Isn't that the class where you make a book?
Thank :P hehe, all you have are the numbers!
Ding ding ding
What's the ghibli game? . Ps3 
Oh yeah, I remember!  :P
No, it was video game trivia in class :P. Don't worry, I didn't end up cheating!. http://www.amazon.com/Reality-Broken-Games-Better-Change/dp/0143120611/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=. This is our reading assignment :D Seems like a cool book that could change the way people think about video games. Also seems useful for game designers like yourself!. hehe, and it provides lots of ideas for gamifying life...  http://www.chorewars.com/. gameify*?
Where will you look first?
It's definitely a large undertaking. I will be making a 2d video game for my game design class!. Using a game engine that we will write!
Thanks!
Yeah! I'm going to get a head start on my readings
I see you're an expert at google!. I can save you the trouble though...! I'll let you know my class names for tomorrow...!. Oh good! (:. How was watercolor?
No way! Does she do out-of-class sessions with groups?. That sounds really usefull!
Like how one of my professors teaches renaissance recreation fencing :P
"renaissance recreation fencing!!". I'd enjoy attending those sessions.
Of course!. I'm glad you understand.
What other duties does a gentleman have?
Then you must get re certified!
I'll sneak you in some day...!
What is the criteria for choosing one?. Or what will be the consequences of your choice?
I love you!
Oh, 99 red balloons!. It is probably as easy for me as for you, since I just use google and also torrentz.eu. In google, I put the name of the book and the word "pdf"
If those don't work, then I check nearby libraries. And then finally eBay price comparisons, or rent
And the textbook exchange site for UVa
if they are at UVa, I can check them out for you
How does one speak incorrectly about reading?
That's very intersting...!
Words of gold, I've heard. I'm going to walk to my meeting soon...!!. But it's not til 9pm, so I've got time!
I plan to read it one day as is!
It was good!! There were stickers and prismacolor markers!
That's fine! I will accommodate! 
You're wonderful!
I am on a mission to do handstands!!!
I am at 45 minutes a day for Japanese !
Thank you! I found a really helpful guide online.. Just 5 minutes a day!. And 5 min for splits still too...!
I have Tevas!
Indeed
No way!
I am Leandy22
That's me!
I guess so! :P. Sweet dreams to you (:. I'm going to read and then fall asleep (:
I think you can replay it once! 
PennApps is tomorrow!. Still up for sneaking on the bus? :P
You just get on the bus, and if they kick you off, well at least you tried!. :P But only if you have the hackathon bug.. And once you're stuck in Philidelphia, they can't turn you away..!. Well you'd better work on your own goals, as hackathons just may not be part of the equation for you.. I'll take the opportunity to collaborate with new people!
I'll let you know, thanks!
Would you mind editing out the non-seriousness out of this? http://devpost.com/software/omnicash. I'm using the link for an application, but can't figure out how to edit it. And maybe separate the headers from text to make it more readable
The parts where you mention negative things about yourself. Also, it's very insulting to graphic designers. Though I know you were on the spot when writing this, I hope you don't actually believe that.
You can cut out those sections and just leave the first two
Thank you!. I appreciate it!
Thank you! I hope you have a great day too!
Thats right!. Then Cloud Computing, Programming Languages and Defense Against the Dark Arts
Catch you later!. I hope you have an awesome day today in Portfolio Prep and Modern Art1. !*
That's okay!! I'll just have to play in the snow with Tanul instead!
She is doing well!! And in two of my classes!!
I love you too!!
It was a good party!
I am going to redirect my efforts toward getting way ahead on homework and finally making my portfolio!. I like the way you think though!
Yay!!. Our whole house is having a Harry Potter Marathon!!!
Oh I can totally multitask. I think it will help me with Defense against the dark arts
Bertie Botts? . !*
Oh goodness. I'm not sure I would want that even if I had everything!. But I do have yellow cake from last night!! :O
There are many glass mason jars!
This movie is so beautiful! ;). :')
Oh, it will be awhile before I forget it again!
Oh yeah!!. You meant "we" like you guys!. Good thing you are home in Blacksburg for the snow!
Oh no!. Or maybe good if you have classes on Monday!
Magic is real!. :D. I love you!
I'm not in herbology!. Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!
You have a point there!
Or are you?
No owl contact :(
Sleep tight!
Oh goodness. . Way out of character for me!!. 4. Movies :O. Goodnight you (:
Five actually!. I love you too ! (:
Pie day?!
Good day!. All you need are some clothes that cover your body! :D Just don't go far. . If you don't go out it should be because you don't want to!
I'll play with you if the snow is still there!!. The theme of tonight's party is hipster!! I could probably take some hints from all the times I've seen your sister
I have the suspenders I got you! Maybe they would work with a skirt?. Hairstyle recommendations?
Haha :P so um.. side ponytail? Braid? What does Molly do?
Hey, I'm going for trendy, not ridicuous!. When she had long hair?
I could totally do a chopstick bun :P
Please excuse mirror pic, just wanted to show you my outfit! !
Not gonna lie, these suspenders are supposed to be yours :P
Thank you ^-^
I should have cleaned my mirror!
You haven't offended me!
I am turning in for the night!. What has your day been like?
Why lackluster? What did you do?. Was the Genki book helpful?. It's great, huh? (:
Did you feel very good working on them? What types of assignments do you have so far?
I was curious about how it felt working on them because the book I am reading, "Reality is Broken", explains that games make us happy because they challenge us and show fast results for hard work!. It makes me think about how I can approach schoolwork with a game like mentality!. I can pass on the book if you are interested in skimming it! It's pretty interesting
Well the author talks a lot about the elements of a successful game!
That sounds very interesting!. Sweet dreams (:. So are you doing your game in 3d?
Okay, neat!
(:
Anything for you! :D
I love you too!
Goodnight, then!
Good afternoon!!!!
Aww, I hope your day is fantastic too!!!
Quite possibly, since I have no recollection if it. New things are always popping up on here!
Goodnight to you too!
Then don't go.
No
Yup, I'm good!!. We are on number 7 :o
It's an addiction . He is creepy as usual. Lurking in the music room
I will be cautious!. Goodnight to you too!
I love you too!!
You don't bring it up so often!. Does your dad prefer the movie to the book?. Did he like the silhouettes you did?
Thank you! I hope you have an awesome day too!. I love you too!. What's your first class today?
Wow, sounds like fun!. Send me some of your drawings if you have time! 
Any of your arts!
What does "bothering me" mean to you? What sort of bad thing results?
Sounds like missed opportunities to me!. You should do what you want without fear of consequence, so long as it is what's in your heart!
It's art.. Actually just showing off how tiny my new travel hair dryer is!. Ready for camping! :P
I'm so excited for game design!!
Oh!!. Let me send you that book!
Did you get it?. Let me know...
Oh good!. Let me know what you think after skimming a bit!!
:D
Woo!! Just finished the Harry Potter Marathon :D
It makes me want to revisit the books!. I forget, have you read any?. Or seen the movies?
Wow, never finished the final book?! :O . There are 8 movies.... Dun dun dun
Yes. There are 7 books, 8 movies 
Deathly Hallows, amn. oh, you knew :P. How can one stop being interested in Harry Potter..... :P. The magic never ends!
Well it's not going anywhere :D  Off to sleep, then... Sweet dreams!
I love you too!
Good morning! Did you keep the kindness card alive?  Just saw something similar at my school!
The simplest thing is to attach something nice to it, and then slip it in someone's bag!. Like "hot hands" 
I am good!. What are some highlights of your day?
Worrying about homework already?!
Where are you at in the job application process?
Definitely more important then your classes though!. That's good. What came in the mail?
Oh um..!! Coconut oil?
Oh!! Your passport?
I mean the thing that came in the mail.. How is your friend Neal?
Hmm, what came in the mail then?
Category is?
Is it for you?
Interesting..
I'm curious to hear how the book is compared to the movie!. I figure you would have images in your head while you are reading!. Just pick one ^0^
I would love to, but I'm having trouble finding a ride for the right times!
I'll keep looking..!. Want to go skydiving with me?. from 14,000 feet?
Over spring break...!. I'll go shower while you think about it... Or I'll just buy it and then you'll have no choice...!. :P. That, or I can do two?
Well I need your consent. Otherwise I should only buy 1
Do it for you :3. Ah, I really better go get ready!. Ttfn :3
https://www.groupon.com/deals/florida-skydiving-center-9
I guess we get T-shirts too!. Yay!
Rawr
Oh really?
I love you too! Enjoy watercolor!
Princess Peach?
I mean.. who are all these pronouns that you introduce at times?
I could definitely infer it, but it's just sort of weird!
They would definitely think so... And today she ate soup!. :P. Just being silly...
I'd argue it's just the same judging by how random our topic switches can be!
Sure, but there are many other female characters in your class. I just would end up asking either way, just to clarify.. I'd have a different response for each case!. Well, why didn't your teacher like your painting? Did it not embody her teaching?
I don't like to infer to such an extent. Communication is key~!. This is how people end up thinking that their friend's neighbors are cucumber poachers!. Misunderstandings abound. Catastrophe!
Thanks. It's a good practice for conversations in general!. And especially story telling!
Yum!
What do you generally eat?
You mean fresh vs frozen? Or canned?
Which of those things are bad for you?. Bread and granola can be if they are mostly made with white flour.
But whole wheat and oats are good!
That's good!
Are you enjoying your food?
Make sure it's brown rice :D !. Don't want you getting scurvy...
:P
"Are you enjoying your food?"
I mean, do you like the food you are eating, or do you wish your meals were different?
$30a week is enough for a pretty healthy diet, I'm finding $. !*
I can show you my food plan!! It's so cool!
Oh, it is pretty late!. You going to sleep?
Oh yeah! We did that in Entrepreneurship class!. Strengths... Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. Normally in regards to a business. Which class would that be fore?
Haha, I just read it. Sounds very useful!!. Hopefully you have enough practice since I ask you so much :P
(Sorry bout that). I mean.. Thanks for being so tolerant of my questioning and prodding
Peter--I sent you links to job applications. I don't know how much more I could prod you...
I thought I should back off because you know what you're doing and I was probably just pressuring you.
The website would have been fine for Google's purposes
Well if you have to wait any longer, you will miss out on some good jobs. The deadlines are already passing.. I mean, if there are some companies you would really like to work for, you could at least look up their deadlines. And then that might give you motivation to get moving!
They aren't going to come to you, you have to go to them.. Or do you mean that your heart hasn't picked anywhere?
Well that worksheet is a good place to start.... I guess I'm luck I have my dream company to aspire to!. lucky*
I dare you.. I dare you to apply to some company.. You have until 11:59pm on Sunday.. Or else pink tarantulas will invade your house. my house*. Proof is a screenshot of the submission dialogue. It doesn't even have to be a "serious" place. But just anywhere. That way you know how easy it is!!!!. Applying is not the hard part... Interviewing is.. Dooo it.... :P. *floats away*
Ya!!. Yay11*. Yay!!*
Oh I am doing that one more thing.
I'm not going to sleep yet, but I better focus on my homework! It's due tomorrow night, but I don't want to get too close to that deadline so I might stay up and do it.. I don't mind either.
Well I do mind actually!. Because I'd rather see you.. But there will be time!. Lots of time during spring break especially.. Sweet dreams to you if you are going to sleep!
Cool! Good luck to you too then!. Why do you say you "don't mind.". Sounds kind of sad to me.. ?*
Kind of like a "Whatever" sort of thing.
Like a... "You can step on me. I don't mind.". Like giving up or something.
I guess that's okay if it genuinely doesn't bother you. But saying you don't mind when you do just seems wrong.
That sounds like you're saying I am unreliable. .. I'm getting to sleep now, so good night!
Good morning!
Oh good, it's you!!
Now I know it's definitely you.
It's you!. The pool/classroom session is this weekend!. I guess I still need to find a way to Blacksburg though. The first session is 7pm Friday, and the last ends at 5:30pm on Sunday. Let me know if you happen to see any rides!. I don't have much time to check today
That would be awesome, but I value your time and would rather catch a ride if possible.
I messaged her 2 hours in.. Thanks though!!
If you pick me up, I will drive the way back :P. You can also post your ride to make gas money!. Maybe you could end up with net profit :P
My class ends at 12pm!. Actually 11:20pm!
Richmond is on the way!. Would you be definitely able to drive me if I cannot find a ride? ( I need to reserve our spots shortly)
Aw, thank you1!!. I'll choose less bothersome music :P
It costs about $10 each way, or $15 round trip
You can leave as late as 1-1:45pm, I think!. So whatever works for you!. Did you send the second to last message to the wrong person?
I'm about to check to see if the Richmond person an take me..
Could not find any :(
I didn't see it. Which group is it in?
That might be cutting it a bit too close if he leaves at 4pm
You could just give a wide range, and then if people don't have tight schedules it could work!. Is something serious wrong?
You could probably narrow it to 10am-12pm?
I may not have a ride back on Sunday yet, either... But I'll work on it!
That too would be awesome!. I am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!. Good night for now!
:D!
That would be good! You would likely get more takers for a round trip. (no one likes being stranded!)
:P But I do hope to alleviate your driving on Sunday. It would be if you ended up driving me
Good night
Good morning!!!. How is your thing?
Yeah! I recommend you post in the VT uva specific ones too. Unless you're leaving in the hour :P
I will make a post saying that I am leaving at 3pm?
Also, regarding your posts... if you leave before 12pm, it's good practice to comment that you left (or mark sold), or delete your post. That way last minute people don't have to wonder!. (personal experience)
:D !. How courteous
Maybe bring your swimsuit (I don't know if we'll need this for the "gear fitting...". I'll print your forms for you!. (just in case we are stuck in traffic and have to go straight there)
You don't have to wear anything under your clothes!. And whatever you were planning to wear should be fine!. You can bring casual clothes to change into if you think it would be a problem!
(Maybe shorts and a t-shirt would be good for gear fitting?) I'm not sure what to expect.. Might just be measurements or standard sizes, even
I'll get to class! :D. See you around!
Thanks Peter!
:P
I am safely at home!!. And I changed it partly per your recommendation  ! (:
I miss being with you too!. Okay, thanks for the advice! I have random bruises
How will they ever heal no. now*?
I will be back before you know it...!
The printed magazine biz is a dying industry o.o. Maybe that explains the priceyness. Good night to you!
Oh! The game is called "Undertales". Awesome! Mobile content!. I love you too! (: Sweet dreams!
Wow, you know...!. Good morning!!
What are you doing today?
Haha, that's so cool!!!!. I am attending and catching up with my classes today! Along with my usual goals of handstands and Japanese and music . Shower now!. (Ttfn)
Ah, thank you!
That's perfect!
Yeah!
Similar set-list I think....!. :P. But if you join the event, there is a chance to win tikets.... tickets*
Yay!
I am working on homeworks and also getting distracted by looking at airbnbs?. What er you doing?
I've learned that art things rarely turn out the way I imagine them in my head! But I never think of it as messing up, just new art! :P
Surprise1. !*
May I see your ducks? :D I like ducks!
Wow, live art...!. Okay, thanks.
Oh good!! It'll be nice and spiffy!
Good morning!! And your guess is as good as mine!
Good morning!. Again.. :P
I slept well!. It was short, but I woke up feeling fine!. How about you?
Yup!
Whoops :P I was pretty involved in my homework
Thank you! I hope you have a great day too!!!
Oh good! No, I did not
Why is that?
Oh :P. Lots of wisdom in one place!
Oh no, don't get it!! It's evil.. I am skipping small group because I am doing an emergency   homework crunch!
Thank you! (: . What are you working on?
Isitthekettlecorn?
Noo, the greater of the two evils.. In contrast to my usual poor self control, I'm really good at not buying sweets ^-^
I love you too!!
Good morning!
How did that go?
Uh-oh... Well there is a 1-2 week adjustment period while your hair is over-producing oils.
Yay!! Hello!!!
Quick.. form an acrostic poem about your day using your name!
Ohh, very interesting! hehe... "Eating food". Do you mean The Wizard of Oz book cover. ?*
Yes
I did not receive your picture!
Oh interesting!
I like it!. But that's coming from a person who likes Papyrus.
No, just that I am far from a font expert.
Yes, I got it at 23:28. That's quite the puddle!. Looks cute!
I'll still be around for awhile!
Oh definitely "around around". I'm so around that I roll away!
So so!
Oh yeah, it's a ball.
Me too!!. Goodnight (:
Good morning!
I did sleep well!!. Did you sleep well?
Whoa :P Accidental texting?. Enjoy your class!
That's interesting!
Awesome!. Need any tips?
I put the flour in before I get my hair wet.. I use my fingertips and rub against my scalp all over!
White flour has a higher pH and is more alkaline, so if you have wheat flour, you should use that instead!
(Aim for a neutral pH). Baking soda is also very basic, and I have seen people on blogs have issues with long term use of that!. Just water also works, but will be oily the first week!
Thank you!
:D
Thank you!. I'll be in town by 5pm. I plan to go to the scuba shop to get signed off
We could take one car
I'll let you know when John gets back to me
No worries! I was walking over to the gym!
Good morning!
Thank you (: I'm driving home at 2pm!
That sounds awesome!! I'd have to clear some space though... Maybe the rec center gym?
What would you like?
I would love to play ping pong with you!
Sweet dreams!
Good morning!
So ready!
Thanks,  you too!
I've eaten! Thanks for the offer though.
Help with what?
Oh yes!! That would be awesome!
Thanks
I'm glad you've been having a nice day!
Ah, I thought healthy breakfast/lunch and exercise sounded like a good day!
What made you think I don't want to see you?
Okay. Define "neglect"?
We never made plans
You never mentioned that earlier today!
I did, I just never heard from you about it.
What's wrong?
Why do you feel alone?
I would love to talk to you! I don't feel like I've been ignoring your messages--but there hasn't really been much conversation starting.  I feel like a lot of your messages today have been pretty passive. Like you're not really looking for an answer, you're just stating details.. Or like you're not expecting any response.
For example... :. Any time you want to take care of that, I can do so.  PeterI mean we, of course, but I was trying to say I would be ready whenever you wanted to.. There's nothing to respond to really, it's just a statement that you are ready to do things if necessary.
Well in my head, if you were interested in hanging out, you would ask me if I want to hang out with you. And then, if I wanted to hang out with you, I would accept and ask you what you had in mind.
I'm not big on hinting at something. I really need you to spell it out.
You can make a time and I'll tell you if I won't be ready by then.
How are your ducks looking?
Aw, thanks for bringing it all the way from Radford!
Are you going to sleep?
Saying goodbye?
Okay. Bye for now!
What other bye is there?
Is that the kind you mean to tell me?
Why did you become so dramatic?. What went wrong?. Need to talk about something? 
Oh my goodness.... So sassy :P. (Got this from the girls in my house, but I think it could apply)
Well let me know when you do feel like talking again! . Is anyone home with you?
Are you sure?. I was going to contact someone to keep an eye on you, but I can come over there if you like, too.
It's okay if you want to break up with me, but at least do it in person please . Or better yet, try and make an effort to resolve things first. Communication is important. I didn't even know you were so beat up about all this still
If you allow/want me to I will.
I do like your compliments and everything else.. You've got me all wrong.
And yourself.. Well thanks for sticking with me for as long as you did. 
I understand. No need to spare my feelings.
No way, you have to do it in person :P. Do I really make you feel that terrible?. Also, what happened to mediation as a first option?
I want to see you all the time.
I feel like you don't ever ask me out on dates.
I can't remember the last time you were the one who voluntarily planned something for us. Can you?. I've thought about this and it's always been that way, I think.. Generally
It sounded fine.. And I liked your plans. 
If you were thrilled about your plans I would love to do whatever with you!. You always seem to be worried about me not liking them though. Which is not bad, but I'd rather you stay true to what you want to do.. You can't really coexist if you're giving up a part of yourself
Those things all sound like fun. Have a little more faith in your choices!. I'll tell you if I end up not liking it.
Going through with something means more.. I'll play Earthbound with you. You didn't seem so excited for it, but if you express your interest in it then it's fine!. That day you seemed way more concerned with what I wanted to do.
Then why did you give up on it so easily.. ?*
Be passionate, take a stand : o
Then ask to set it up and play!. Do whatever you want! Don't let me get in the way :P 
Okay. Asking without expecting a no is a good first step.
That sounds good. What time?
Okay. Should I meet you there?
Okay!. How long would we stay?
I'll pack a lunch!. I'm not leaving until Monday morning.
That's what doing homework is for!
I'm already packed and ready :P
Sure!
I'm a little movied out! But I wouldn't mind watching a portion!
I haven't quite materialized all the links yet, but we can do that tomorrow!
See you tomorrow!!
Thank you! :D I'm buying tickets for Ann Arbor, Michigan!
Thank you!. Wow, I just got approved for another credit card!
I'm going to apply for another one too :P
It's really easy.. But probably easier for me because I have existing credit and online checkings and savings account.. And a yearly income :P. And rent...
Goodnight!
See you in the morning!!
:D !!! It is really good!
Chocolately meat tends to have that effect
Terms and agreement o.o
It appears so!
Good morning I just remembered that there's no Wi-Fi at Squires. What do you think about that?. I think 9:10 Is a bit safer, but I will still hurry!. I will text you when I am absolutely ready, that way you don't have to wait around. Breakfast at my house?
Howdy!
It's going well for sure!
How's your homestead going? :P
I see!
Oh good!
I am writing a blurb about how I wrote my write up!. **. about how I wrote my code :P. Not a write up about writing a write up... That would be crazy.
That's write!
Haha, I didn't mean to type "write" instead of "right" earlier
Oh good :D!
hehe, I should've just played it off
That is good (:
Yes, because puns don't define hugs! (:. Sweet dreams to you!
I love you too!!
You too !
Doing middle splits o.o please send help. Mind over body.. 
Awesome. Be warned though,  there is much involuntary wimpering involved
It's quite pitiful sounding
Well thank you!. I hope you have a fantastic Tuesday!!
I love you too!! Thank you (:
Thanks, you!! ("
Suspenders day!
Oh good! Is there one coming up?
Anything you'd like to do in particular?
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings!. Thanks for letting me know how it made you feel
Just thinking of how to respond.. This chocolate is really awesome!
No, google "capital one 360 reset pin". Should be somewhere in their FAQ
Bitcamp registration is open!
Both. But also because they considered designers last year, and are likely to do so again!. Also, the application is super non discriminatory
:D
Okay. 
Cloud computing and Defense homework!. You?. And nomming chocolate
cashew chili
My mom packed me some!
Noo :P. Making chocolate is too powerful. This is the perfect darkness though.
Are you doing the watercolor tonight?
Going to sleep?
Oh thank you!
Rawr!!!!!! (:
Interesting!. I can help you make them if you were wanting to.
Okay

kk
O>o
Oh good! I hope it works!
Your sketch looks interesting,  though I didn't look at it too closely. Were you hoping for a second opinion? 
Having trouble finding anything
Can't they just be hinges for the purposes of your project?. Or even thick wire?. *stiff hinges
Goodnight! 
Good morning!
Thanks a bunch!
Just to pack and unpack sprite sheets. So, separating the images and also placing them on one sheet
You can check my house this weekend!
May I borrow your video camera this weekend to film something? . If not, I have a backup I can use!
Thanks! It's pretty informal, so I'll do the filming
Application pitch. Yes, that would be helpful! 
Thanks!
Maybe a very minimal background blur? . Or nothing blurred. Also, I am not attending those :P
OH means office hours
Enjoy your class!
Thank you!
It makes it hard to respond when you preface questions assuming the worst!
I don't understand your previous message.. What do you mean?
I guess that's always possible, but it makes me feel like you don't believe in me when you mention it.. Or like you don't think I want to see you.
There's never obligation.. And why would it hurt if I wasn't able to spend time with you?. And keeping plans isn't hard. In our case it's the making them that seems difficult.
I do want to see you, but you saying that you don't think I want to see you makes me not want to see you.. Does that make any sense?. Maybe it's like a fulfilling your expectations sort of thing.. I hear that if you believe something, then that thing can become a reality! Maybe that's what's happening?. What are your plans?
I am trying to analyze what stirred me up when you said "Unless you don't want to see me..."
I think it is because I felt like I was being falsely accused of something (one of my pet peeves), and also because I am upset at your low self esteem :P. http://mgerber.blogspot.com/2009/02/always-expect-worst-and-youll-never-be.html. I agree with this blog post.
I will accept blame. But let me know how I can improve/what I have done recently to make you feel that way?. Otherwise it is a dead end claim.
I didn't realize the first one would be hurtful. You'll have to explain what exactly I do in the second one. The third and fourth are not recent, but they sound unresolved still so we should discuss it again in person.. There are plenty of things you can do for yourself.. The range of things you can do for yourself is unlimited.. Ability and action are very different.. I don't doubt your ability, but certainly your action.
You are a free person and you can do whatever you want though!. So I will try to remember this always.
I've told you before, I would like to help you through certain things that are probably good for you but you need nudging to do (aka applying for your dream job)?. Still not sure how to do this the right way.. It's like should you tell someone if you think you can help them?. I'm surprised that the things you are hurt by the most are not the things I would have guessed.
You were exactly the person I wanted when you thought you were the person I want.. It's some strange paradox
We should get to sleep, but let's talk about this in person over the weekend.. Resolving things in my past was necessary in allowing me to move forward. I hope you can understand
It sounds like you need to resolve this part of your past!
You have everything to do with it since it affects you so.. The resolution would be in you finding peace with it.. You can't help when someone dies, yet we must resolve the event.
The question indeed.. When you find your answer, then you will find your peace!. Maybe!
I'm assuming the person is me?. Or nah?
I'm sorry, I didn't know. I like it because my roommate says.. says it*. What does that contribute to our running conflict?
Would "Or no?" be better?
Not my intentions.. What did you mean by bringing this up? And you're the only person that I've been in a relationship with.. ""*
Oh, I see. I couldn't infer that from the sentence alone.. Well as I said before, I would really rather resolve this in person.. Would your room be a good venue?
I insist that we recreate this in person, since messaging doesn't convey enough.. There are so many things left to wonder at.
Thanks for explaining. Imagine the conflict if both of us thought that way.. (Assumed the other was busy)
Part of expecting the worst?. Did you read that blog post?. Extra time is just a construct.  My hobbies are what I do in my "extra time.". Seeing you is another thing I do in my "extra time". Technically all I have is "extra time.". I just choose to fill it up because I don't like not having plans.. /not doing anythign. anything*. (two non-equivalent statements)
Who is that a quote from?
I don't remember saying that.. Context?
You are always part of my future.. Even if we mutually decide not to date. You will still be part of my future.. Unless you choose to shun me. Then you will just be a part of my future I think about, but never see.. I don't remember that conversation at all.
But I'll take your word for it, and say that it doesn't sound like such a bad thing to say.
It just sounds like you took offense at a harmless statement
And that you are inferring things from the sentence.. I love how in your ideal world, I am always calling you "silly"?
well, not always.
That person could be you. It doesn't exclude you.. You still are.
According to you.. Since we are in a long term relationship, you are the most likely.. (According to me). (and maybe past studies)
The future is always changing. I don't know everything for certain. There are a lot of aspects out of my control.. Any pressing concerns you must have answered before I go to sleep?
Don't worry about that. I could've left earlier if I wanted.
Maybe I would have stayed awake anyway!
Good thing you know otherwise!
Sure sure.. I've felt the same way about things you've said, but it seems silly to me now.. Of course hindsight is 20-20
I don't feel a particular dislike towards any of those.
It depends on the man.
It would be foolish to form opinions of like based on one trait alone.
Though I've done it before. Good looking in my eyes.. Which will vary case by case.
Why would I be dating you if I did not think you were attractive and the best potential husband?. Spoiler: I wouldn't.. It really bothers me to see you being so destructive to yourself.. (which is the conclusion I've reached). (please enlighten me if that's not what's happening). Sounds like you're unnecessarily inhibiting your own happiness.
So you think I'm the one lying to myself and I think I want you but I actually don't?. I suppose that's possible if I'm just too delusional to notice.
You are.
But you might not be if certain things don't happen in the future which I am trying very hard to make sure they do happen.. But not being ideal doesn't mean I wouldn't make it work anyway due to other factors!. (like love)
Ideal is impossible and it is probably for the best.. Ask me why in the next episode!. Anything you must say before sleep?. Please don't miscontrue my last statement or anything else.. They could be interpreted in many ways since I didn't elaborate.. Should go without saying, but I'm afraid that you've jumbled up more than one of my intended meanings.. Based on recent discoveries... We will resolve on Friday!. Tomorrow I am booked from 11am-8am. 11am-8pm*. minus 15 min breaks. So, last thoughts?
I love you, too.. And you are forgiven (don't mean to sound condescending by forgiving you, just thought this is the appropriate response to an apology). Good night!
Good morning!!
Oh! Why is that?
Well thanks! I'm excited for you too!
It looks like a really large step!. : D. Will we feed ducks?. I am looking forward to seeing you!!!. http://tohad.deviantart.com/
I think so!
How does this look?. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Kelty-Black-Redwing-50-Large-Backpack-Back-Support-/231842085017?hash=item35fadd7899:g:hh4AAOSwWTRWu8XX. Is that the older model you were saying you preferred?
Who do you mean?. It's 25 dollars less then the next one up.
Whoa!? Link?
Wow! It's on sale since I last checked it!. I guess this would be a good time to bit :D. buy*
I'm going to buy tomorrow night.. (hope the sale is not over o.o)
Thank you!. What are you up to?
How great!
:D Sounds fantastic
I am looking at breakdancing clips online!
Thanks!. Maybe, but what isn't?
Learn by watching!
Which is why I am watching it at 0.1 speed!. And other variants
Yeah! It is a good way to learn to start with1. What do you think of these? http://www.ebay.com/itm/Aeris-Accel-Scuba-Fins-BLACK-Size-SMALL-NEW-Snorkeling-SCUBA-OCEANIC-/172089447877?hash=item28115495c5:g:SewAAOSwFqJWqq~L. Right :P I guess you are asleep!!. Good night!
Wow, you are like a price matching expert!
Oh good!!
Good morning!!
I'm awake!
I am eating breakfast with my mum!
What are we going to do?
Oh that would be awesome!! But no need to film it in Squires!
I'll figure that out once I know what to say!
Awesome!
What's up?
Turning in an assignment! And then going to shower!
A discussion with your professor?
Skypeness?. Awesome!. Wait, this is incredible... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs654PYe3qw
On the spot!. Musical talent is super cool.. That would be a fun superpower
You're welcome
:D I like Studio Ghibli music!. What will be our first stop?
That sounds great! I'll see you at 2pm at my house then?
(Attack! )
I'm really looking forward to Spring Break with you!
Haha :P Is this a pre-scheduled closing?
That bad, huh?. How exciting!. Hehe, did your school close when there was 2'+. ?*
That's good?
Oh good!!! I'm glad!
Making biscuits! 
Yum!
I am glad you're safE#E!~!!!
Haha, you're right :P I love you too!!!
I had an amazingtastic Valentine's Day with you too ^-^ !!!!. Thank you for everything, Peter!! (:
What do you mean?
Okay!. Anything you would like to do?
That sounds like fun!
I will try hard not to injure you!!. Sweet dreams!
:P I would rather not injure you!
Oh no!! Someone should have been there to tuck you in : 3. I can do that for you ^-^
Aww :P Hey!
No, I"m free!!!!!. I'm reading "To Kill a Mockingbird"
haha, that is what I thought!. Oh, how did you like the book?
Ah, just got an internship offer for the fall, but not sure about whether to accept...!! What do you think?. "I am writing to see if you may be interested in a potential engineering internship next Fall. I recently co-founded an engineering company called Sonotherm ( I serve as the Chief Technology Officer) and we are working in the field of thermoacoustics on an idea to completely transform how HVAC systems are done. We have some fantastic ideas to make HVAC green and energy efficient and it uses a combination of thermo and heat transfer with IoT coding. That combination of mechanical engineering and coding, on top of how much you have impressed me and Christina in your classes, is why you are my first choice for an internship. ". Well you probably can't decide much for me, but maybe I can just bounce ideas off of you.... I thought I could probably make enough time every week to contribute 10 hrs/week
I guess it is a lot of extra work though!. I was thinking it would be a good opportunity to get involved with a startup
I would rather be working with mainly the coding side of things though and less on the mechanical side
It would be nice to have additional industry experience though!
That's true... How else could I arrange to spend 10 hours a week though?
To be beneficial to my future career... I like that it is "energy efficient"
I guess I should inquire about the actual work I am doing, and let him know that I am interested in the coding side of things!
10 hours a week is like taking on another class...
I've never had an internship during the school year
Not an option, since I need all the classes to graduate!
There is no later on :P. Unless I spend an extra semester
Hmm, I'll probably decline but let him know why.
Nice to hear from you! Super cool that you are starting this company and I was also glad to read about your successes with your consulting firm!  It's an honor that you would contact me for this internship.  Thermoacoustics sounds interesting along with the opportunity to work with IoT sensors and help the environment by potentially eliminating the need for refrigerants in HVAC.  Due to a recent change in my coursework (currently completing my Master's in CS instead of finishing a second major in Mechanical),. (drafting email.. :P. _. Due to a recent change in my coursework/career interests (currently completing my Master's in CS instead of finishing a second major in Mechanical), I feel that I would be less suited for this internship (depending on what you had in mind...)--I'm more interested in working on the CS coding/design side than on the thermo side.. Hmm.. how should I wrap this up?. How do you feel about travelling starting on Thursday night instead of on Friday?
No, but I only have one, and it's just a lab, so I would skip it!. I have a feeling many others will too.. So that would be more like.... 6:15pm - 8:30pm: drive to Blacksburg
Not ready yet :P. 8:30pm-12:30am sleep 12:30-1am pack car food! 1am-4am Leandra drives, switch at gas station 4am-7am Peter drives, switch at gas station 7am - 10am Leandra drives, arriving at Cumberland island 11:00am ready at Ferry, depart for Cumberland island. How is that?
That would be awesome!. We can buy some of our camping food the weekend before, and then the fresher foods (veggies) near Cumberland island. We should try and leave earlier if possible.... Or is that schedule too packed?
Longer nap sessions?
I mean, how would that allow for longer nap sessions?
How do you figure that?
We'll be on the road for the same amount of time no matter when we leave
If we leave earlier it would just cut into our "sleep" time period. So we would get less sleep, but it would be safer just in case we miss a turn, or there is traffic.. Another decision is whether we should bring our own bikes..
"Bikes are allowed on the ferry for a $10 fee, space is limited. Reserve when purchasing Ferry Tickets. Adult bikes can be rented on the Island for $16 per day or $20 overnight. Rentals are first come, first serve, limited quantity.". It would ensure that we have a bike available to us!
It is!. Since we would be keeping the bike for multiple days. I don't think there is a big fear of bike theft where we'll be parking either. But we can both bring our bike locks.
($20 each, round trip). I have a bike rack already, so we can tentatively decide to bring them!
We would test our the bike rack with our bikes the weekend before. We would need extra bungee cords
Oh good!
I am ordering my backpack shortly!
They are pretty cool! They have room at the bottom to strap on a sleeping pad!
Or sleeping bag?. We can do all preparation on the weekend before!. I will make reservations now..
Depart Friday 3/5 at 11:45am and return on Sunday 3/7 at 10:15am ?
This is for the Ferry reservations
Okay so... Sunday is a flex day, Monday is Disneyworld?, Tuesday is Skydiving and Manatee Snorkeling?
We'll be nearby.... :P. And then scuba dives on 5/10, 5/11?
Yeah? :D!!
I hear Universal Studios is better... !. What do you think?
:D Harry Potter is cool!. Might be too expensive to budget.. but we'll see!
Whoops, how was I going to wrap up that email again?
How do I end with declining?. Nice to hear from you! Super cool that you are starting this company and I was also glad to read about your successes with your consulting firm!  It's an honor that you would contact me for this internship.  Thermoacoustics sounds interesting along with the opportunity to work with IoT sensors and help the environment by potentially eliminating the need for refrigerants in HVAC.  Due to a recent change in my coursework/career interests (currently completing my Master's in CS instead of finishing a second major in Mechanical), I have a feeling that I wouldn't be suited for this internship (depending on what you had in mind)--Though I'd be comfortable with working on the thermodynamic aspects, the CS coding/design side is where my heart is!
Thanks for the suggestion.. Sounds too formal though!
OKay!
When are you free on Thursday!. ?*. on 3/4
I made camping reservations for 3/7-3/9, so that means we have the weekend free..!. I am wondering if the long drive will make us too tired to do activities once we arrive!
I think I'll be okay!
I could just do more of the driving while you sleep.. It's 11 hrs drive from Blacksburg, so I can take 8hrs, and you can take 3!
Is that enough time for you to sleep, you think?. Nah, I want you to be well rested if we are doing Manatees the first day!
Well just sleep for as long as you usually do.
So shall I book Manatees on 3/5 at 8am, then skydiving on 3/6 at 8amish?
Awesome!
Thank you!! I hope you are having a nice President's day too!!
I love you too!!!
Oh my goodness!!. That's incredible!. Go you!
It sounds like a fantastic start!!
You need a new wooden egg?
What is the justification for larger puppets?
Oh neat!
I'm glad you are doing well!!. Yes?
A secret admirer? Someone unknown to me and the world?
This T.S. Eliot book is really wonderful!. I know you (: And I return the feeling!
^-^ !
I enjoyed hearing you recite the first two lines@. !*
Definitely!
That might have stopped me!
Sweet dreams to you@. !*
Up to you! I don't completely plan on hacking! . (Since we'll be doing pool and also packing!)
Oh no, was that me?
Nooi. Next time I will prewash them!
Size 2! I have an ae.com reward so I can buy online!. Thank you though!!!
They will return one day!
Thank you!! I really hope you have a great day too!
I love you!! (:
You've got this!!
You can anytime!! I'm rooting for you!
I would like to!. I love you too (: How did it go?
That is good!
Thank you so much!##. And I'll always believe in you!
Awesome! ! How was that?
:D
Ahh, that was so much fun!! :P
How did your lumberjack hold up?
Sounds like the physics matches up!
Should be pretty stable especially if his feet are not tiny! 
I hope you have success finding all the parts!
I love you too! ! Sweet dreams!. <3 <3
Good morning, Peter!!
My day is progressing well!! And thank you!!. How is your day going?
Whoa, preview? Does Dorothy have arms?
That scarecrow is nifty!
Probably a burlap sack!. Or a nice suit
Oh have fun! I love you too!. Check this out! Super easy application process just for fun! https://www.google.com/about/careers/search?authuser=0#t=sq&q=j&d=visual+designer&li=10&j=visual+designer&. Thanks for sending this!
It's super interesting!. I like the lion and dog!
Oh it's promising!!
I love you!!
That would be the awesomest!! Alas, I am not so lucky!
Wow!!! That sounds amazing!!!!~!!!!~~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!!!!!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!. You can plan the food list if you like!!
My suggestions for camping are those salmon packs, fresh fruit and veggies, rolled oats/oatmeal, nuts, pumpkin or sunflower seeds, and non-perishable chicken (in pouches if possible).
I'd rather make more dark chocolate!!
Granola bars are tricky business :( They never stay together.... But rolled oat balls are probably easy!
http://www.getcreativejuice.com/2014/10/peanut-butter-oatmeal-energy-bites.html. Without the chocolate.
hmm
Could I buy your backpack on my credit card, and then you pay me back in cash?
That's fine!
I have to make $3000 purchases on my CC in 3 months to get a 50,000 mile bonus!. I think it will be pretty easy though.. Especially with 2 plane tickets
Yes :D!
Do you have 15 minutes right now?

Or do they only delete on my side?
That's embarrassing.. I've totally used that feature to correct typos before. Well you delete them on your side then :P. "right click"
on the message
Go to messenger.com
Could you send me the "how to use" details for the groupon?. Click in top right, "My groupons", then "View Details"
Would you mind saving the webpage (as html). and then sending it?. Or a screenshot. Thank you bunches
Thank you mucho!. (hug)
(:!. Aw!!!!
I am so looking forward to spring break!
No worries if not!. We'd just have to stop a bit more!
(but let me know ahead of time so we can plan out the stops!). Not a problem!. (:. Sweet dreams, Sweetheart (:
^-^ !! I like Cutie Pie
Sweet dreams (:
I love you too!. Good morning!
Hi!! I am doing well!! How are you?
Hehe :P it's all frozen!
:D. Whoops, the sloth show is tomorrow!. I will still try and go :P. Poco the sloth!
Ahh, creepy!
Thanks for trying!
Thanks ^_^ . I will be thinking of a neat hack idea!!
A tool that plans sightseeing for you if you are in a location for the day!. It shows you a bunch of nearby activities, then you pick the ones you want, then it makes a schedule for you!. Kind of simple, but I want something like that! :P
Sounds simple, but I bet it'll be a challenge to make well!
No idea!
Torture?
 I think I'll call it.. TripPlanner!. Or Adventure
I can call it Adventure! 
I like Adventure! Thanks though!
There isn't a sign up.. Yet.... I wanted to make an app, but I would have to learn a lot about mobile!
Maybe...
Thanks for the help! 
I love you too!!!
I'm working one homework in the meantime!. (:. Was done last year O>O!. http://devpost.com/software/via. But that doesn't mean I can't do it if I wanted :D
I love you too!!!. I think we could use some graphics!. Our goal is to get people to buy school supplies for underprivileged kids
Whenever you have time!. I'm just imagining cute pictograms where kids are sad at first, and then happy when they receive school supplies. And then the doner feels happy and gets "points" . We're not sure about the points yet 
Thanks :P
Thank you !
Good morning!
Yes please!!. We don't have a name for our system... https://mhacks7-bchip.c9users.io/
 I like Both! . Especially giving tree
I think it's okay
That's the one!. It's only competing is supply pal. Would you mind making the little pictograms  I mentioned?
That would be awesomeness!. They could add to your portfolio!. Or it's just you being nice :3
Could you please return the manatee giftcard?. I didn't realize it expires so soon!. We can buy the other Groupon option for $30 each!
Not sure.  Google Groupon return.
Could you call customer sevice?
No, just a return. And then ask whether you will be able to use the -$10 discount again. I can do it if you need!
You can call their phone number!. You should just say you ordered it, but didn't notice the expiration date was so soon. From googling "Groupon customer service". 1 (888) 664-4482
Yeah, they might close at 5pm, I'm not sure!
I'm looking forward to seeing you!
Wow! :3. I was thinking cute/cartoony
will this help?. https://answers.gethuman.com/Groupon/How-do-I-get-a-refund/_1_
877-788-7858 This number is more reliable (press 6 twice), but only open weekdays.. I can log into your account and try to cancel it?
Okay, thanks
Still on hold?
Sweet, what does it say?
Okay cool. I just submitted that request. Should be fine since it will be time stamped.
Thanks. You can get off hold :P. Hope you were using a land line!
Haha wow
It looks good, but not as I imagined.
Like, closed figures
But don't waste your time!
Like this: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/. (video)
Or these http://previews.123rf.com/images/lordalea/lordalea1209/lordalea120900005/15046665-Stitch-figures-isolated-on-white-Vector-Stock-Vector-stick-kids-children.jpg. Yeah! Your drawing is fine-- they just don't have bodies
And maybe a thought bubble above the sad kid. Nah, nice solid lines will look a lot cleaner.
There is none!
No, just a whole background image for the website.. It would be super cool if it were more than crayons... Ideally we would be able to see the results of providing the children with school supplies.. Like maybe the kid goes on to do something really cool now that they have a tablet, or maybe just learns better.. Who knows!
Anything cool tech. Maybe they built a robot!. Whatever you like though!
But keep in mind, the viewing audience totally supports technology.. Rocket ship is super impractical impossible. But I like your dream big attitude
Help kids reach their potential
Doesn't have to be robot. Maybe collaboration among classmates. Building something techy
The classmates worked together. Whatever you can do is fine!
Rocket ships are way too big. And not really technical. Well, rocket ships are technical, but don't really correlate to any school supplies. https://mhacks7-bchip.c9users.io/
Email back and say, I would like a refund on the groupon, per the "3 day clause"
Sweet
That's so perfect!. It looks a bit much like a phone though, so maybe it could become a laptop!
It not too late, thanks!
A giving tree logo!
Good :P
Nice!
It looks good!. Could you send a white version?. With red apple
plz send smaller. icon
No. Need it sized small enough to fit in the top left on the side bar
I don't know. At least 10x smaller
ty
icon 2 needs to be smaller ;(. Like half size. thank you!!. or 1/4th size
Thank you!
Well good timing then :P
Wow, you're good! I didn't even notice!
:P hehe, I just slept 5 hrs during the span of the hackathon, and I felt pretty awake 2 minutes ago, but now that the bus is moving.. I'm like
:P. hehe. It's a baby!
:D I know why that baby bunny is so happy then!
:P Whoops!. The second one looks less painful.
I didn't realize MLH had a photobooth!!. Maybe this is the first time I'm seeing it.
It's all automatic, it's pretty cool!
It was a quick dodge!. Tell me about your weekend!
:D That's sounds awesome!! I look forward to seeing both of those!
Oh!! Her face is differ now?
I will let you know once I see it!!. I am in NYC! (:. Just in the airport though :'
Thanks!! I hope you are too!
:D Sounds like a hackathon!
Awesomeness!
I hope my diversions didn't lead you to such a fate!
I mean you helping with the logo and picture! 
Not a problem, but just know that I appreciated having all your support!. I'll let you get right to those drawings!. Have a productive night! (:
You're incredible! . :D. You can do it!
Very interesting!! I had not know. N
That's good news!
Is 24 fine? I bet you could do more if you wanted!
Well do as much as you feel that you can finish in time!. Or if you went above and beyond, your teacher would probably offer an extension
Is this based off the text?. Sweet dreams to you!. Airport camping!
That is me all bundled up!. I love you too Peter!!. Sleep tinight!. tight*
:D. Happy Monday!
I am in NYC airport Lagardia, in terminal D, waiting to board my 10:15am flight to Cville!
There are comfy chairs at least!
Where are you?
Thank you!!!
Yay!! I can't wait to take a shower!!!
:P. Let's go to NYC the right way next time...!!!
Nooo
Ttfn, takeoff
I love you!!. How are you?
I'm well!
I am back at the house!!
I chose to do the hackathon and demo instead!. We need to hug a sloth later though. There are some in Costa Rica, I think. The backpack came!!
It's pretty fantastic!!
You can track it on Amazon
No, because you want to make sure there aren't problems! 
Hopefully MITGSW. I just need to apply!!
I love you too!!. I didn't finish, but I request my "one-time extension," so I hope that works!. Let me know when I can call you back tomorrow!. Sweet dreams!
:P It's so quiet!. Maybe sometime between 9:30-12:00?
Anytime?. Sleep tight!
Oh yay! Thank you! ! :D . Sweet dreams 
Just my dark room!
Good morning!
I slept so well :P. Too well.. you might say!. And yourself?
No
I've never heard of her!
That's pretty neat
Any chance you could help me take my car in for an oil change on Friday?
Awesome!! If you can, that means I don't have to find an early ride on Friday.
It closes by 5pm, but I would call and make an appointment today if you are free on Friday!
Awesome!. Well, I'll call tomorrow because I'll be in class all day
Thanks! You too!
I love you too!
That is a okay!. I love you too!
Whoa!! So cool !!! We can listen to the audio book on our road trip :P. You should friend me on Memrise!. I couldn't find any open bookings, but how about a self-guided tour? :D http://travel4wildlife.com/how-to-swim-with-manatees/
It sounds even better!!. We can even pack a lunch and stay out for a long time!. I think we will definitely want wetsuits though.. There are some really cheap women's ones on eBay! (~$25). I think I'll get one.... Not sure if it is included in your rental!
Feel free to peruse eBay for one!. If not, I'm sure they have a different rate for wetsuit rentals that probably isn't more that $15. than*
How are you doing?
I'm doing well...! Just ferociously battling homework!!
Hugs!. Always welcome ^-^
^-^
I see!. This weekend is also VTHacks!
I plan on taking the bus over! You should sign up for VTHacks!. :D !
I will be spending some time there working on a small individual hack.
Nah, I won't be needing any designs. Save for perhaps a logo.. And no, you can still sign up.
Do homework and eat the food.. :P
And contribute ideas!. Not if you are interested in innovating
That's nice! I want to spend some time with my mom, though!
Oh, that would be awesome!
Goodnight to you too!!
I love you too!!
That's great!
Good morning, Peter!!!
Congrats!
Thanks!!. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Aeris-Accel-Scuba-Fins-BLACK-Size-SMALL-Snorkeling-SCUBA-OCEANIC-/401076277216?hash=item5d62024fe0:g:57EAAOSwKtVWy196 !
I will try not to forget when the auction ends.... Totally snuck into this PearlHacks picture last year :P
Aw, thanks ^-^
I like your duck painting a lot!. I never received your picture!
I like it!
Will you really be able to drive my car on Friday?. I can make other plans if not.
The other option is my mom taking it to Walmart tonight. I think that will be better. I don't suppose you have any random free time today?. Also, I can't tell any mistakes!!. (was that even english?). The snorkel, fin, mask set will be $50 to rent. How does that sounds? Check out some of the snorkel/mask prices online.. they are not too expensive, but you'd have to buy snorkel, mask, boots, and fins.
Okay cool! Just making sure it's okay.  I am planning on getting a wetsuit for our kayaking trip. The rental prices are pretty expensive for one of those at the Tech dive center.. (~$60), so if you think you might get cold, if might be useful! The kayaking place might rent those..
They are $48 to rent at one of the kayak places.
They will be different for all brands, but you can find the sizing per brand and also use reviews. Really nice mask+snorkel sets online are $40, new boots are $30 (I'm got mine for $15), and those accel fins are $60 (I'm bidding on those used ones for $30)
Nah, I don't mind if mine isn't a really good fit since it's only $20 (alternatively.. I could buy a new one that I know fits for $60...) What do you think?
Well, it might be comfortable, and I might love it!. So I"m willing to take the chance!
But think about renting vs purchasing.. I think purchasing will only be $110 (and that's if you want nice new stuff). Measurements would be good, but I gotta buy now so it ships in time.. Same for you if you are interested! I can pay using my credit card.. You just have to do all the selecting/reading reviews/sizing
I'll help you pay half if you pay half!
Maybe you can ask someone to help you do measurements?
looks like the regular size accels wil fit you. (Fins)
Reg is size 10-12
:P No guarantees on fitting!
It looked very generic
You have pictures on Facebook
There are pictures of other people too
You mean Owen's?
Yupyup
Yeah, that looks pretty great. clear one seems good based on reviews. Unless you are "creature phobic," says one user
What does that mean?
Why such high star value then?. Also, I have the seadrops. They might not have toothpasted
Use baby shampoo :P. The reason I was asking if you had time earlier was because there is a Groupon code that expires today for %20 off, and I was going to pick out some restaurants we could eat at during our road trip down to Florida (or during).
No worries! Also, you said you are busy until 4pm?. :P
Oh, okay!
Well if you have time... Any restaurants along here would be good!. https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Blacksburg,+VA/Charlotte,+NC/Columbia,+SC/Savannah,+GA/Jacksonville,+FL/Gainesville,+FL/Crystal+River,+FL/Florida+Skydiving+Center,+440+South+Airport+Road,+Lake+Wales,+FL+33859/30.8532764,-81.548749/Key+West,+FL/@28.4522653,-83.6259347,6.87z/data=!4m57!4m56!1m5!1m1!1s0x884d950adc06dcc3:0x86ceb8ea4842da2d!2m2!1d-80.4139393!2d37.2295733!1m5!1m1!1s0x88541fc4fc381a81:0x884650e6bf43d164!2m2!1d-80.8431267!2d35.2270869!1m5!1m1!1s0x88f8a5697931d1e3:0xf32808f4b379fa96!2m2!1d-81.0348144!2d34.0007104!1m5!1m1!1s0x88fb75fc78f20659:0x4e0c6751036020bc!2m2!1d-81.0998342!2d32.0835407!1m5!1m1!1s0x88e5b716f1ceafeb:0xc4cd7d3896fcc7e2!2m2!1d-81.655651!2d30.3321838!1m5!1m1!1s0x88e6202169bf2c2b:0x80e7795d28108d96!2m2!1d-82.3248262!2d29.6516344!1m5!1m1!1s0x88e85976f242b497:0x90b9ea35b30946bb!2m2!1d-82.5926012!2d28.902479!1m5!1m1!1s0x88dd0f2405e67ef5:0xd7f41b2a2df52195!2m2!1d-81.619573!2d27.897454!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x88d1b134ad952377:0x3fcee92f77463b5e!2m2!1d-81.7799871!2d24.5550593!3e0. Takes a bit of research/time to find these things though.
(ex.. type city center into groupon (Savannah, Jacksonville, etc), search for "food and drink", click groupon (check location to make sure it is close to route), check menu/fine print to make sure we can use it.). Just by midnight, since the promo code expires then... If you could find 3, that would be awesome!
We will be road tripping on Friday, leaving at 5am. So we'll probably hit Charlotte or Columbia for late breakfast, Savannah for lunch, Jacksonsville or Gainesville for dinner!. Or some smaller place inbetween major cities.. Groupon has a handy map function, but unfortunately you can't query ALLL groupons at once... (i think)
That's awesome! No worries if you can't!
Just work as hard as you can this weekend and during the week.. Worst case you'll just have to spend free time during our trip on your project. Oh wait, it's all free time :D. So you're in luck!
I'm planning on doing tons of homework during the hackathon.
Not sure what "come in" means
I guess do all the tangible things in Blacksburg, and bring all the things you can do on the move on our trip
But the project is due tomorrow?
I guess that means you have to order it today or tomorrow or Friday. Probably tomorrow
Cool. Someone at your house could look it over with you over video chat. Oh, also send me links to what you want to get (if you choose not to rent). Sorry so many thigns.. things*
:P Wait, actually?. Do you not handle stress well?
If not, just drop the Groupon stuff and I'll find your gear for you and then just recommend it.
Well just focus on school, I've got the trip covered.

"Sizing - I usually run about an 10.5-11 for sneakers and I ordered a 9 (after reading a lot about bootie sizing) which was just slightly too small. Hopefully that'll give you a good idea of what size to get.". For the Thermo Bamboo one. May I call you while I walk home?.

I am home!. But you may still call me!
You betcha!. Watch out world!! I have cocoa powder!
Just Hershey's Special Dark
Om nom nom!
Whoa, you are awesomeness!!. Oh no, but the first one is 1 hour out of the way..
To check how far it is, use the google maps link, delete one of the waypoints, and paste the address in. Then drag the address closest in sequence.. Then note how long the trip takes, then remove the restaurant and check how long the trip takes now
Okay!
Bring it on!
The second restaurant is right on the way!!
I'm sorry then :( At least you can catch up on Thursday night.
Will you buy the Aroy Jung one?. And use the 10 off code again if possible!. (make sure to get the Friday-Sunday one). for 2 people!
Oh yeah, that one. Oh wait... can you stack that promo code with the 20% off?. SALE3
I can't remember!
Oh hey, this might be a better deal. NEWOFF. for groupon 10, it has to be at least $25
I think I am morally against eating shark!. Whoa! Lots of food!. How much have you investigated those choices? (ex.. menu reasonable, close to route)?. You can buy whichever you think will work!. ^-^
I think my Pho phase is done for now!. Compared to the other options O>O!!!!. Om nom nom!
Om nom!! All look god!. good*. (I have a thingy due at midnight, so I might not get to look much :(). But buy whichever seems relevant!. And remember, we'll be making the same trip on the way back!
If the prices are reasonable ($20 or less for the two of us with the groupon). I'm down for the sashimi!. How much is a plate of salmon sashimi? :P. Om nom nom. It's pretty reasonable! Just make sure it's open during the time that we'll be passing by!
^-^ Sounds like a date!
Thanks for ordering!! Turns out I did not have time, but I was able to submit my glitchy game :P. It's so craziness
I tried to export it, but it doesn't seem to be working. I'll let you play over the weekend!
I love you too!!. (:
How tall are you?. /how many lb. :D !. Cute bear!

I'll enquire about that one!
I"m going to take a sleep, too!. just about 3 hours, I think!. Good luck with it all!!
I love you too!!. I hope you do too!
No
Yup, thanks!
No, I trust you! I just know you have a lot going on, and also my mom helped to arrange the oil change at Walmart last night. :P No cookies for me, thank you. Unless they are like super ultra all natural/ paleo cookies. Oh yeah, your payment for the flyer you made the other day? :P. If they are storebought cookies, I always like Sandies or shortbread. Mmm sandies ^-^. or ask for vegetables :D. hehe
Yes
I hope you're having a wonderful day too!!. Oh, the sandies/shortbread suggestion was just if it's storebought. http://detoxinista.com/2014/07/the-healthiest-cookies-ever-paleo-vegan/
Glad you're safe!!. Thanks for sharing some cookies! 
Why do you feel so bad?
Yeah, I felt pretty bad too. Plus those instances only get resolved every couple months when we finally talk about it
But it "doesn't matter" right?
Why?. Take care of yourself :3. Don't but your feelings on the back burner! That's how you get burned
I was excited to see you too!. I felt bad because you felt bad and then there was no talking after that
From where?
No. . Man, how come we only talk through this thing even when we're in the same place?. Anyway, I'm going to nap so I'll catch you in a bit!!
Good morning!!
Yay you!
I think 9:30am! But that's without eating breakfast.
I'm hopping in the shower now!. I think I'm going to try and go see Cara speak at her research thing she posted about! (At 10 in squires)
Only if you're ready in time! I can just drive and find parking at squires if not!. And both those sound awesome. I'll just drive so you can get ready properly!
At 9:35pm?. Am*
Awesome, thanks!!! (:. See you then
I'm safe! (:. Thanks!  I always love to see you ^-^
Oh good!!! (:
That'll get me through all this tough work!! I'm open too it!. We have that at my house
Haha :P you and sales
We can
Yes!. Lots of things...!. I can't think of all of them.. but camping gear.. (perhaps lighter/fluid if you were thinking of making a fire) 
Making a list is tough, but I will let you know as I go!
Oh good!!
I have sunscreen and we will buy bug spray! (I'll bring the natural kind as well). First aid kit is good
Sure, why not :D
Oh, I just use eye masks for when I need to sleep and it is too bright.. So I'm assuming you would use it for a similar reason.
Oh, not if it is uncomfortable!! No reason to cover up those handsome eyes ^-^
Okay, I think I know what you mean, and yes you can bring an eye mask!
And just be thinking of things to buy.. the plan is to buy things at Walmart on Thursday night while testing out the bike rack
Okay!. I will know by tomorrow during my class whether it is "okay" to skip. (aka, won't be detrimental to my grade)
Please bring as many straps & bungee cords as you can!
Yay!. Yeah, our dives are the 10th and 11th, so Thunderstorms would definitely mess those up!
Have I left you in the dark?. Where do you think we're diving?
Do you know the dive center?
It's at the Florida Keys Dive Center.
Oh, okay.. That's where we're diving
Florida keys
90451 Old Hwy, Tavernier, FL 33070. Use the Google force...!. :D
Thanks for checking
Sweet dreams to you!!. Good luck with everything!
Good morning!
That's interesting. Sounds like the speech is disruptive to learning!. Or maybe your professor secretly wants to get a good seat!
Whoa, is this your first time hearing about this?
You mean you missed the romantic comedy "Leap Year"?
And being a girl in harvest moon?
I need to play Super Metroid
(most likely, but not determined yet)
I will be skipping on Friday!
Nah, we have the online link
It's legal!
Then illegalness!
If you want.. I'll ttfn!
See you after midnight!. Google.. Is your friend!
It's not a link, since we haven't been assigned it yet, but he said we could pull it up on an emulator
Most likelye!. likeley*. SNES*. Oh I get it.... http://www.snesfun.com/super-metroid. Here's one
Got it
Thanks!. Scary homework.. Well, I probably just need to figure out how to start...
Thanks!. :D. You've got work too
We will help each other ^-^
I will try my best to get started first!
MP1 Pt 2 Language Modelling due tonight :O
No worries! I'm just seeing this now!
Thanks (:
Thank you!
It would be awesome if you book in air B&B in Jacksonville on Sunday night. Could book *
Oh cool!
Yup! I can send you the blurb I wrote so you can reuse it a bit! Actually, if you just pick the listing, I can pay for it/confirm it
en route Lake Wales -> Cumberland island. Less than 2 hours from Cumberland Island. & *
That looks okay, but it has a hidden cleaning fee charge that brings it to $77/night. Is there something less expensive. ?*
That one looks great! I will star it..!. Not sure how much I could count on my cousin offering us space to stay (I wouldn't want to ask unless she suggested it!) I will compose a message now..
Any that look just as good and beat the price of $47?. No need to keep searching, if not!
That's booked
We'll go with the other one!. No more searching :P
Unless you want to find more groupons, no :P. Oh yeah! Yum :D sushi1
We can just find them on the fly.... Perhaps. Unless you have nothing more important to be doing..!!!
That's nice : 3 Focus on your own work and I will let you know if I need something!. Thanks for finding this place!. How does this sounds? Hello Chris! I hope this message finds you well! I was just finalizing my plans for a Florida road trip I am taking with my boyfriend, Peter, this upcoming week, and I noticed we would be passing through Jacksonville a couple times.   I thought it seemed like the perfect opportunity to visit you, since it has been a while.  If you happen to be free on this Sunday (March 6th) evening, we would love to stop by and see you! It's rather short notice, so I completely understand if you are busy that evening!
No worries! There's no hurry
Which one?
Phew, I was about to defend Capital One!. I'm glad I found Capital One! They have such awesome customer service <3
Why not :D. It's the right thing to do :P
Who knows what I am...!
RAWR
*attacks Peter with tackles*
Tackle attack!
Most likely!
peace is the answer!
Could you help me interpret this?. "Are you going to be traveling through Jax to get to your destination before Sunday?". Jax=jacksonville
Ohh, okay
Thanks!
Good morning!
I love you too!! Thanks!
Yay!!
Nuts on sale?
Which store are you headed to?
Oh yeah! I love that one!
My mom has Chia seeds! And you're welcome to bring whatever food you want to eat!. I plan on going food shopping during our trip also!
It's a good idea
It'd be neat to prepack ingredients for making microwave muffins!. And that's good!
Probably not dates :P. But whatever you want to bring for yourself if valid!
Nope : 3. Thanks!
Oh good!
Yum!!. Free to call?
It was good, but I think I was making you feel bad somehow...!
We'll talk more! I'm finally starting this assignment I've been putting off, and it doesn't seem as hard as I thought!!
Sweet dreams 9:. (:*
3/7 morning to 3/9 morning
I'll try and prepare an itinerary with addresses
No problem
Oh nice! ! Can't wait to find out why 
I haven't heard of either
Yesss!!!
The hugs are real!
hug all the things!
Or you can send it to me and I will print it for free!
Okay!
Thanks ! I've printed everything but an itinerary!
Thanks... I think I'm up for the long haul!. How about you?
What are you working on?
What are "leave behinds?". It sounds familiar. I am working on the language model implementation again. And also making a type checker
Oh, interesting...!
There is never a too late, because you don't have to :P
I know!. Sorry, looks like your boots/mask/snorkel will not arrive in time!
If you can go to Dick's sporting goods and buy a mask/snorkel tomorrow that would be awesome. And dive boots if you can find them.
If you can find the exact same kind of mask/snorkel set, it's possible that we could return the Amazon one to Dick's Sporting Goods later
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067BGZBE?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=od_aui_detailpages00
You'll probably want to call the store before you go in to see if they carry scuba masks/snorkel
They have a lot, but not the exact one on amazon.. http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=19701526
The wetsuit came already.. :D. Hope it fits
Cool -- based on amazon reviews?
But definitely call first.. not sure how much selection you'll get at Cbug. Cburg
Thanks!
Will you eat all types of food?. Dinner at my cousin's house on Friday.!!!!!
Okay! Indian food okay?
Want to stay over tonight? Are you all packed?
Okay!. I'll let you know 
Nah, no bikes I decided. Too much trouble, I think!
Would you mind helping me out in a big way?
My game pitch is due tonight, but I'm going to be stuck in traffic. I was going to write about the game I made up with the cats Catastrophe. And I might need to borrow your laptop and crank it out at your house!!. Would that be okay?
Okay!. I'm not close yet, but is there room in your driveway?
On the way over!
Here!
I love you!!
I am good! Not packed :P I think I'm staying here for the night
Yeah! We can do hw!
Oh, yeah totally! You didn't want to stay for dinner?
I would love that! 
Oh I have been sleeping :P
Oh, I am up for working now!
Yeah!
Neat! Dinner is not ready yet, so it might get a bit late though! !
And sleeping at 10:30pm or 11pm! (:. So I guess not that late :P
Okay!. Email: lli5ba@virginia.edu. Last 4 digits: 6339
That one is no longer active, so you can remove it!. Use capital one 360 p2p
Yup yup
It is. Oh, you mean that it worked?
Not yet, but it may take awhile
All the time!
Safe in Cville!. By the way, after we got gas yesterday, do you remember where my wallet went?
Okay, I'll check again later!
Oh, you have it?
Okay, cool!. Thanks! Have fun in classes!!
Yum!!!! That sounds awesome!!!!
Wow!!!
Om nom!!!
^-^ you're a great chef!!!. I love you too!
Glad to know that you had a delicious dinner!! (:. I hope you are okay today too ^-^
You've got this too!! So cool that you are graduating soon!!!
Goodnight!! (:
Oh no toe!!!. I love you too! (:
Good morning!!!!!
I hope you do too!!! Happy Wednesday!
Which promotion is that?
A cup party? What do you do with said cup?
Oh. Can't put hotdogs in it?
Or maybe gummybears!!. Or a sub?
Yum!. Rwr!
I will attack you :3
:P
On friendly terms of course!
Oh good :D
I love you, Peter!!!
What is your day looking like?
Okay :D!! I will be rooting for you!
My day is looking like studying for a test tomorrow and starting/finishing my first data mining research checkpoint :P
Our team is meeting on Friday! I can let you know over the weekend :D
Sounds like fun to me!
Oh good!. Do you know James Franco?
Oh! Anything else?
And the fox in The little Prince!
http://www.johnpauljonesarena.com/event_details.asp?id=732. Coming to a venue near you...
Nah
Oh it would be neat, but there are some other activities I'd rather be doing!!
Do you have any tiny beads and elastic cords?. For starters... learning to surf, more horseback riding, musical activities
Wow!! Can I borrow some this weekend?
:P Yes, they are way better!
Oh yeah...!. Thank you :D. What do you have tiny beads for?
Neat!. I'm having trouble finding a ride back to Cville on Sunday... Should I just take the one on Saturday at 2pm? Or wait it out?
Oh, are you though? :D
You're Peter!
:D
Wow !!!. It sounds like you are doing very well ^-^
Homework date this weekend?
I'm looking forward to it!
So if you had to pick between me leaving on Saturday at 2pm and you not having to drive me, or me staying until Sunday night or Monday morning with you having to drive me, which would you choose?
So you pick door #2, huh?. Well I have to drop off my car either way
Of course!
Nah
Oh yum!!!
You got this!!
Okay, I hope that works!!
Good morning!
Hi you!
Trying to make more progress in my research this morning and studying for a midterm, and then classes/meetings from 11am-6:15pm. Might go to breakdancing practice from 8-10pm. How about you?
Oh, that sounds like a fun day!!. Yay, midterm buddies!
:D. That is so cool!!!. Are you really actually planning on giving me a ride on Sunday?
I don't think I will find a ride. I thought if you wanted to for certain, then I would post it on the ride board, and then people would be guaranteed round-trip rides
^-^ !!!!. What time would you want to make the big drive?
By 11am Monday. But you have class at 1pm, so probably earlier
Hey now... you gotta go to class!
;P. Anyway.. choose a time, and is it cool if I advertise for you?
Cool!
That doesn't give you much break time...!!!. Account for about 30 minutes in Cville (just in case)
Hmm, are you sure? :P Will me staying an extra night help very much?
It's up to you!
Morning makes sense if you perfer driving in the daylight!. prefer*
Okay!. I will go for 7:30am!. Oh! I think I may have found a ride back...
Is 1pm on Sunday okay?
My ride back
I will take the ride!. Though I'd like to see you longer :3. Do you happen to have thin yarn in a shoe color?. (ex while, brown, black)
Can I use it for crocheting?
White yarn would be perfect!!
Perhaps also a small crochet needle?. :P
Thank you!
Thank you Paige!
I love you too!!. I will be getting in around 2 or 3pm depending on how much I pack tonight...
So exciting 
Hehe :P. Goodnight, Peter!
:3
It was good!
Hmm, still haven't found my wallet. Mind if I look around your house later?
Thank you!
Well thank you for looking! Did we go anywhere else after that?
Okay..!!
Closed at 5, eh?. I wonder where I put it in the car...
Oh, okay!
I'm not really sure where to look.
Hehe... all along I just had one eye closed...
Yeah!
Yes!
Yeah!. Crochet needle?. /Yarn perhaps?
We have kimchi!!!!
Would you like to cook with me?
Oh where was it?
Oh good!
Thank you for finding it!
http://spritedatabase.net/files/gba/1174/Sprite/LinkNoCap.gif
I am!
That sounds great!! Thank you
Those are fine for now!
I love you too!! Wow, I am missing you!!!
We can stay in cute little apartments like these when we're in Japan! https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6548145?checkin=05%2F11%2F2016&checkout=05%2F13%2F2016&guests=2&s=HEx-OeRA
Goodnight!!
Rawr!!!!!!!!!. (:. You're fantasticness!!!
Just my heartsong
https://adlayasanimals.wordpress.com/2013/10/16/raccoon-dog-nyctereutes-procyonoides/. Wa, thank you! . Sweet dreams (:
In pom poko!
Sleep tight (:
.:3. :3
I love you too!!
the sprites are way too tiny unfortnately!. I don't like the bald guy :P
They looked so tiny though, and when I zoomed in, the quality was bad-- might just be my image viewer? The size of the entire sheet looks like a width of 200. Pixels. I'll check the actual dimensions at home
Wwaa, too tinu. Tiny**
Lily us 32x48. is*. And that's for the character without a net. If you could all make them around that size, that would be awesome!!
The version I'm using is 32x48
If that the person holding the net (without net) was originally 20x 20, then doubling it would be good (or triple)
How large is the person without the net?. Currently*
A doubled version seems good, but would it be easy to do a triple too, just in case?
Thank you!!. How is your day going?
My day is going well! Just lots of projects!
Lion looks good!
Really really!. Face reminds me of the Ferocious Beast. Just because the nose is triangular looking in the picture
Shouldn't the nose on the lion be on the same level as the mouth?. Like, stick out the same amount. Oh, it does in your drawing.. I meant that the cheek on the right looks a bit lumpy
Well it's fine!. I think Lion King lions have warped my perspective
But the nose is slightly beveled compared to the rest of the mouth, so my previous statement was wrong!
I like the update!
No problem
It will look great!
Thank you for the sprites!! They look good! Haha, Floryan...
Not totally sure :P. By the way, the net sprites (I'm using x2) are a bit too close together for my sprite unpacker. They need at least one pixel between each one. It's not a problem if they are super spread apart
Thanks for fixing!
Maybe smaller ears!
Yup yup! In later levels he might move around, but that sounds too crazy O.o. Might be good to have backwards Floryan if it is easyness :D
Yes, I think he'll be throwing from left and right too!. But we won't need that until later (:
Looks awesome! . I love you!!
Don't worry roo much!! (:
You're fantastic!!
I like the earlier one!. Sweet dreams to you, Cutie!!!
I like the other one more!. Sleep tight!
It all looks fine!
Yup!. Whichever works best. Night!. Keep 1st head though
Hehe, he looks a bit chubby from the sides ! :P ; But nothing wrong with that?
Oh :P
Looks good :D Nice art skills.  I think I prefer the black eyes
Oh, maybe your watercolor would be nice for the show! (:. Thanks a bunch and good luck with all your projects!
Aw, poor lion!. I hope you are doing well! (:
I am (:
That would be awesome!. There's no deadline on it, but I could totally use the front facing image of Floryan with black eyes and smaller ears!
No, the same small (:. Oh, did you send it through facebook?
Could you send the png?
Just the one for now is good :D
Beautiful!!. So beautiful!!
Wow wow, thank you!!. Is now an okay time to call for a second?
Tuck tuck (:. Haha, Floryan looks great!!
Yes!
I like it (:
Neato!!!. Hey, no pressure on completion time :P
I'm pretty sure he's right handed b/c I don't notice anything funny when he writes on the board
Hey.. :P. In Japan I can give you cuddles all the time!. Like on the train.... Too bad PDA isn't acceptable in Japan
Okay (:. It's cuturally correct!. But I guess that's how I act anyway, so maybe I've just been Japanese-like all along
Oh good!
:D Should be easy after this crazy one!. Sweet dreams (:
You mean for backgrounds?. Maybe the classroom first (w/ just the non-interactable assets), and then a table asset!. Good morning!. Well, Table is not so important yet. good morning!!. (again :P)
*tackle*!
That sounds fine :D. Oh no, don't explosion!
It is :P. I'll take a picture today..!
Whoa, that sounds like fun!!. :D!. (:
We can make the animation using the game-functionality!. game engine functionality *
So you would just worry about stand alone assets!. I would try.... I sounds feasible, perhaps. It*
Oh, sounds interesting!. And complex O.o!. Too ambitious?. Maybe easier without chairs?
Eh... Well I'm placing this as low priority compared to the game functionality :P
Hmm.. I like home.. Maybe I will go home this weekend.... I'm going to go shower..! Ttfn (:
Too soon!. Thanks!. ?*. You too!
It's too small of a playing space unfortunately !!. That's why the desks should be separate assets. We will need to tweak it often
It's nice!!. That looks pretty nice!
Oh, thanks :D That will definitely help!
Without them is fine?
But of course it would be a terrible level if there were that many tables!!!. :P
Whoa, funky tiles!
Whoa, that sounds insane. It'd be fun to work on this with you over the weekend!
Have fun!! (:
He looks great!. During lab, the bosses will be the TAs
Hey :P 
No :P. Haha, it would be awesome if the poisoned students fell out of their chairs and had x's over their eyes. But it's a little silly
Whatever looks most comical and keeps them out of the way of the floor. Or maybe they become obstacles :P. hehe
Postponed to weekend :P. So that you can work on more relevant things
Let's do Japan logistics/trip planning too!
I can help you find their number if you need!
Neato :D
No grain, b/c then you might have to have multiple desks with different grain?. But I like the grain!
Hmmm... maybe
But I think a thinner table would be better
up and down width
Like, the size of the students head. Just slightly taller
Awesome!
Yay!
Hey, don't worry yet :P. Also, feel free to make that appointment... really only takes max 15 minutes (or maybe longer if they put you on hold). And who knows when someone might steal the next apppointment slot!. Hopefully people in Radford travel less (need passports less) than people in Cville!
Need advice, or sympathy?
Okay, cools
I'm going to go hang out with Floryan
Oh no!
Yup yup!. Ttfn (L. (: *
Whoa, I'll watch my head!
Yup, one at the front right, one at the back left
Wow, that is really something!
Everything without the sprites is good!
3 different types is fine for now! But I guess the more types the bestter. 
I'll probably omit that before because I don't want to detract my efforts from the actual gameplay!
The character creater!. Creator*
Like mini-floryan!. The animations are nice, but I'm not certain how to use all of them yet!
Wow, so much!. Where does he go when he falls?. Where does the chair go *
It's so cute!. Should he produce green bubbles as he falls to show poison?
Something that doesn't look too creepy :3. Cuddles for Peter!
For you ^-^. Sweet dreams (: See you in the morning!!
`Oh cool@. !*. Good morning!!!
(:. :3 Another sunny day
Which is tomorrow around 7? ;d!
^-^ !!
Ahh, he died :P. No, you're super prolific and I can't keep up with production needs! :P
So much awesomeness,  so few pixels
It's good!. Have an awesome day!
No worries :3
Wow, thank you!
Oh! What time is your art show/where? Would you want me there?
I can be there! I would just need a ride home afterwards!. Where should I meet you?
Oh, and then we would go to the art show together?
Why would lack of people worry you?
Okay :P
I'm in! (:. Sweet dreams (:
That's me! (:
I'm making doughnuts with my Mum! I could accompany you a bit later though!
I don't need material!. Thank you though!
No thank you, but nice of you to think of me :D
Probably not, but it depends!
Well, I probably wouldn't
Yeah :3
How was JoAnn's?
:'(
That's okay! What are you up to in the meantime?
Oh! Magazine spreak?. spread*
Leaving for Joann's now?
Yay!. I'll see you soon!
Up to you!
Well, whenever you are done with whatever you need to do!
Take your time!
That's good.. I'm going to the pharmacy today to get my 2nd Hep A shot.
Have you left yet?
https://www.google.com/about/careers/search#!t=jo&jid=34174&. http://www.tapblaze.com/careers/illustration-game-artist/. We have the whole keyboard to work with :D
We want the game to be two player, so we'll try splitting up the keyboard well!
:P Yup, we are hoping for two players ^-^
Oh I get it!. hehe
^-^ Oh no..!!. Please put them somewhere safe with me!. for me*. :3
(hug). You're so awesome!!. Have a safe drive!
Don't forget your food!. You're the best!!!
Oh good!!
Nice!. Can I help generate ads?. Or Contents?. What is the theme?
Let me know if I can help!!. I love you :3
Yes :3 I'm making the store screen!
(Coding )
It consists of ItemDetail objects!
I like the one you have already!. Oh, just the antidote.. My team said they are fine with whatever creative liberties you want to take on the items!. As long as the functionality is the same!. (which it will be, since we are coding it :P)
Okay!
It looks good!
How will they know which buttons to press for which actions?
Oh, so spacebar!
And for exit.... Probably "ESC". Is there a way to display that on the screen?
That you press "ESC" to escape?. :P. Or the secondary button...
Secondary button is good!
Probably not, unless we finish everything else early.
Key mappings are a good idea!. For an on player basis.. I'll be sure to add that to the Player class
There are only two powerups right now. So probably one for each powerup
Those can be drops!. All the VP would stop moving temporarily?
And then you could go collect them while they are floating!!. Neat!. It's like you're the only one moving!
But you want the timer to be done more quickly that way you don't have to defend as long?. Because that signals the end of level
I guess it has its pros and cons then.... :P. I love you!!. How is your magazine?
Cute!. You're cute!. Haha, that's awesome :P. You and the cheese puffs ^-^
Yes :D. Sleep tight!!
(hug). And for Leandras!
Good night (:
Wow!!  Looking cool! Ginger Ale is a bit creepily toxic looking.. Any way you could send me these assets separately... ?  Store screen, blue item detail background, item icons (w/o name), and transparent looking reflective overlay.. Cool bubbles though!. Oh, and the highlight frame for both the items and the cancel/insert. I like the cheese puffs :P
Technically it's easier that way, but I wanted it to be more diverse in case we introduce more items or want to change the icons or descriptions or cost very quickly.
Thanks! Also, was the hallway/new classroom already around. ?*
Oh! Where did you send it through?. I couldn't find it on the Google drive
Thanks a bunch!. Wow, thanks!!. Ginger Ale looks better from far away!
It's in the 5 week window!. If only there were someone with a free appointment say... tomorrow or Wednesday!. Then it would be six weeks. :P. If you wanted to try calling more places to avoid expediting it, feel free. Sounds good otherwise!
I'm sort of weird, so I would probably try and get an earlier appointment an then risk it coming on the earlier side of 4-6 weeks.. (4 to 6 weeks is the standard processing times). 2-3 weeks is expedited. (b/c $60 is a lot). If I were you, I would not expedite it, and then hope and hope that it comes before the 10th :P
Then you travel to Washington D.C. and pay extra to travel there and wait in line for the whole day to get your passport. Or something like that
No, but the odds of it coming in 5 weeks are in your favor!. (aka > 50%)
hehe, I'm a terrible influence
Fun road trip for you if it doesn't work out :P
I'll try and come if I don't have exams!
hehe :P. I. I'm up for it!
It all looks to be in order for now! Maybe an unpoisoned/cured animation?. I'm imagining some floating.... :P
That sounds good!. And like a better animation :P. But how do they get off the floor?
It's okay if it doesn't connect! (:
That can wait for forever because we can just use a duplicate of the first player for now!
Is there a Find and Replace function for colors? . I hope you have a really awesome day!!!
Om!!!. Wow, that's amazing wonderful!
Oh my
Whoa you are super efficient!!!. I was hoping you could make the highlight, itemdetail  and icons the same size for each of the items . Which might require you saving the 4 images separately for me. (Two icons, one blue bar, and one highlight square)
You mean the VP?
Whoa, that is super exciting!!. Thank you bunches!!
You're so prolific!
That's okay!!
An after level screen could be good! Wow ^-^ !!!!!. This is you :D. So amazing. (the symbols behind the dog say "do do do do" in Japanese :P. Which is described as a "whirring or spinning noise". whrrr
It was hard to find online. The same size as the store screen!. This is after time runs out right before going to the hallway!
It adds up experience points accumulated from the student and displays your level, and it has options to increase your stats (movement speed, net swing speed, net length). (and health). Or should health be a forced attribute? (aka, you get it automatically). Well, 4 attributes isn't too many...
Sure!. It might take ~20 min
I'm not totally clear either due to lack of video game experience :P
!!!
Oh that would be neat!!
Can you think of a game where the score screen adds up your performance in front of you?. Not sure if I'd want to do the same thing due to complexity, but it sounds cool!!. I think I could make it happen. I've got to postpone this for now due to class!
It looks just like a notebook :D
So cool!. (:
I'm still figuring that part out :P. For the stat upgrades, do you think it would be cool if there were little icons/animations describing each upgrade? Or should it just be your character there, and then the listed attributes next to him?
That could work...!
I think I will do the score on one sheet, and then the stats on another sheet, that way I can easily support two players by having a second stat screen?. Hmm...
Oh, okay!
It sounds really neat :D!23213
Did you think the icons/animations for stats sounded good?. Like something for health, net range, net speed, and movement speed
I'm not sure about that part.... If there was only 1 net upgrade, that might be feasible.... Does it seem difficult?. I think for the current net animation, the right and left ranges seem smaller compared to the up and down
Okay cool!
For right and left? Probably the same distance away from his body as it is for the front?
Neat!
Yeah, that can wait :D
Wow, these are so amazingness!!
Sounds solid :D !
Don't worry about the game for now if you've got other things you need to do!
My game engine already supports animations where the image is the same!
It's called "tweening"
Yup :D
Yeah, but I prefer having an image for it!. Well..
Oh cool! Thanks!
I think the icons/animations representing each attribute will go on top. And then... I'm still thinking about the rest. :P. Ahh!!. :D
I love you too!!!! :D !!!. Haha, apparently they switch in a later movie?
Awesome :D. Could you please send Da Bomb chips as a separate 76x76 png? For some reason, my sprite unpacker isn't keeping the black on the bomb when I export it.
Or 84x84 with excess around it would make it easier, that way it automatically lines up. Same with the soda :P. I should probably install Gimp for this... :P
(:. Oh no, I got so used to seeing you each weekend that it will be hard to not see you this upcoming one...
Thank you!! Those look lots better!
Oh no, the black isn't showing up on the microwave either!. (vending machine). Did you use a separate layer?
That might be why.... I want to give you all the hugs!
Yeah, I'm not sure what it is then.
Same with the hallway, but the rest on that sheet unpacked alright!. (:
Wow thank you!. Ah, the excess border kind of leads me to the same problem. (having to "unpack" it to crop it)
I should definitely install gimp :P. It is the right size, I just need to remove the transparent border
For the hallway and microwaves
It would be the easiest if the hallway were flush, and then the microwaves and notebook had a transparent border that is the size of the hallway.. hallway/classroom. And for the hallway and classroom to be the same size. 577x322. They are now, which is good. Yay, the store is shaping up nicely in code!
I lub you
I can't wait to take a look!!. Sweet dreams to you (:
:D Thanks, you!!
Hehe :D . Whatever is best to animate! I thought the whole bag was the bomb. It might be nicer if it's one use, because then they don't have to save up so much to get the bombs (:. Sleep tight!
It'd be like th rowing a pillow (:. Night night!
Ahhhh, so cute!!
Good mornning!
Haha. Is that a banana slug?
As of now :D. Classroom Heroes*. Because I want to make two player a thing
Whoa, for Jabba the Hutt that is pretty cute.. Yes, that sounds good!. Wait, that's like Mario :P. Also, no clicking.. but arrow key selectors are good. What would be on the title screen?
Maybe it says "Classroom Heroes," with the (es) looking different from the rest, and when the highlight is over "Classroom Hero" it shows one player, but if you move the highlight to "Classroom Heroes,"  then one player pops up from the ground, and when you move it back, he disappears again.. Perhaps as a bonus, you can also customize your character in this screen by using the up and down arrows ...
Use up and down to cycle through the characters and then it changes their display icon on the screen. Whichever one you start the game on is the character you are
You mean different characters?
Oh, yes, I suppose so, but the title screen background would be the same, and the only things changing would be standing sprite (so it would just involve using the standing sprite!)
But that can be a last addition, since we're still aiming for functionality
hehe :P. Or if you are making victory jumps for all of them anyway, we would just reuse that!
Dun dun dun...!. :P. My teammate wanted to make cool easter egg drop items, like the Mario mushroom, Zelda pots that you can hit to break,
Nah, too complex. Well, too distracting. The mushroom makes you faster, and the zelda pots drop VP
Thanks ^-^. The coding needs to happen next :P
hehe
Oh, maybe the three of us :P. Me, Christine Kim, and Nakkul. I will send pics, but additional characters aren't imperative
There's no find and replace for colors?
You can hold off on making additional characters!
Yup, I'm sure!
Looks fine to me!. I was hoping it would be playful/cute looking. Like maybe there is a superman cape on one of the letters :P
Aw :( How so! . ?*
May I call you?
Hehe : P Where did you find this?
http://www.my-personality-test.com/personality-type/?gclid=CJS6z56C08sCFZcdgQodmiIGsg
Haha, we are exact opposites
Not sure :P. Well, mostly opposites. Did you get the same result as last time
Neat. https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality
That's yours, right?. Where did Harmonizer come from?
This is also isfp
https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-relationships-dating. Do you resonate with the personality description?
I thought mine was like spot on
https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality
Totally matches ;P. Haha, how's this...? "ENTPs' idea of fun is often rooted in self-improvement, and people with this personality type bring their partners along the way, as much in a spirit of sharing as in a spirit of expectation. ENTPs see either growth or stagnation and don't buy into the idea of a happy status quo, making them demanding as much as they are exciting.?
hehe. And this one... "An odd juxtaposition arises with ENTPs, as they are uncompromisingly honest, but will argue tirelessly for something they don't actually believe in, stepping into another's shoes to argue a truth from another perspective."
ISFP doesn't really sounds like you.. It sounds like a super passive, quiet, shy, chill person.
But apparently David Bowie, Lady Gaga, and Michael Jackson are ISFP. So they are definitely getting things done!
Me too, yo!. Or at least, "ENTPs" be mad creative
Guess I better be more cautious of your feelings ;3
Is this true? "Likeminded types get along well enough with people with the ENTP personality type, but more sensitive types, and society in general, are often conflict-averse, preferring feelings, comfort, and even white lies over unpleasant truths and hard rationality.?. They can't handle the truth!!!
Wa. :3. Right.. emotions.
:P
Hmm, really?. I wonder which personality type better suits you!. Are you going to sleep?
I love you so so so so much. Good morning!. I am getting vaccinated for Rabies and Japanese Encephalitis :P Not totally necessary,  but my insurance covers it, and I plan to interact with wild rabbits, so why not :D. They are both 28 day series. If you can get Typhoid, Hep A, Rabies, and Japanese Encephalitis all under your insurance, you should!. Since Radford doesn't have a travel clinic, you'll probably have to go to the public one!. I think you'd be fine with no vaccinations (except arguably Hep A), but you should take advantage of your insurance while you have it!. What is Scott's number?
Thanks! I hear it's his birthday!
Soon I can pet all the cats!!
Mystery. I just love this one :P. Interesting composition.... Implied evil horse plotting?
It's probably a fake horse :P
Dun dun!
That looks nice!!!. I'm going to head over to class
(just looked at the main vid)
Oh, wow!. Is this an official magazine?
Wow, I didn't know!! 
Man, I'm pretty sure you don't need his permission. If you found pictures online from Paranormal and wanted to use them, then who would you contact?. If you were profiting or publishing, it would be different
I'm sure he'll be flattered!. Be sure to mention how much you like his work
Sounds fine.. I guess it's a good excuse to get your name out there.
That was quick.. He's a professor, no?. So pretty supportive of education, I bet!
Good for you!
Congrats. Hugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#@$#$@#@!!!. :3. How are you feeling today?
Oh no, really?. I am feeling good!. Going to a research study soon to earn some moneys!
No problem! I was not planning to go since they are not sending buses. I think delicious chicken adobo could help!
Totally!. With not focusing
I am interested!. At what time?
It would depend on ride availability that weekend, but I will see!. What is the event for?
I wish I could make that happen~!!
Well there are definitely some places in Radford that deliver soup
Oh! What about the soup?
I was going to order you some ^-^
The best I could find is Chinese soup :P But maybe sleep is better?. Egg drop, hot and sour, miso, or wonton?
So sleep or waiting for delivery soup?. I haven't ordered yet. Could always save it for tomorrow!
:D!!! Which kinds? Or any other Chinese food that you would like?
Why not both?
They are just single servings I think.... How many of each would you like?. And would you also want steamed shrimp with veggies, or anything else?
shrimps or scallops or chicken?
Scallops?. Or maybe shrimp is safer.... They are the same price
steamed or grilled?
1615 downey?
Aw, I don't know if it will let me pay online, but you can use your card, and then I can send money through Capital One, so it will be like I paid :P
You can use your card. Do you have at least $20 on it?. If so, I will press "Complete order" and see what happens...
Aw, it does say you pay with your card in person, but they might call you to confirm the number?. What is your capital one email and last 4 digits of your account number?. Sorry it could not be all mystery deliver :P. delivery*
Is that your Account number or number on CC?
It's gotta be your Account number
Cool, thanks!. How much do you plan to tip?. Well, you don't have to, but at least I can cover you if you do!
I recommend $2. But up to you!
Just let me know afterwards
Cool! Check your email to confirm transfer (:L
Yum!!. ^-^
Oh, was the food decent? :D!!
Oh good! ("
I love you too!! (:. I should've brought your popcorn!
No, I just like popcorn!!
Good morning, Cutie!!
How are you feeling today?
I am feeling well, though tired!. I will progress more tonight or tomorrow morning (:
I love you too!!. You're welcome! I hope it helped!
*charging*
Haha, you named them Microwave?. What should happen in the case that you try to purchase something, but don't have enough VP?. Should a "not enough VP" message, pop up? Or something more interesting?. (I think it would be more work to "grey out" the ones you can't afford
Any time ever!. :3
You just rest up now
Yum!
It is on pause while I work on VTOL!. I'm trying really hard not to do my team member's work for them, but it is things that are essential to the game.. So hopefully they do it today or tomorrow!
I can work on other things in the meantime
You're the best team member so far!
Phone call?
No worries
Just working on the game!!
Oh no!! I hope you are feeling better soon!!. Sweet dreams, Peter (:. Good morning!
Hi!
Okay, you?
I love you too!!
Thank you (: I think I am doing better! How are you feeling? 
Whoa, greyed out?. Oh hey, you read the todo? :P
No, you don't have to read it  :P. Wow that is really cool :D I need to book some things soon . Good morning!. ^-^
Oh yeah? :D!!! . Would you be free to video chat and figure some things out for about 2 hours sometime today?
Oh cool!!. When are you free today?
Oh neat!!. Let do like... Maybe over dinner?. Oh wait, let me check...
Yeah! Over dinner?. :P
I am working on the game now!!
Wow, I am so glad (:. I am set with assets for now, but might ask you for advice!!
^-^ !!. Are you possibly read in 5 minutes? :P. ready*
:P Early planning?
It is not as scheduled, but is an opportune time for me.. (Is it also a good time for you?
Okay!. Skype?
I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rawr!!
O.O!. Hehe :P. The pink bear looks less enthusiastic in this one
(:. :3. :D!. So dazzling :P. I hope the illustrations are going well!!
I am happy with it! (:
Is that The Little Mermaid?
Whoa. And then you trick people into following you into the ocean. Because you're also a shapeshifter!
Whoa, multiple brothers, eh?
hehe, were you a mermaid, or merman?
Victorious?
Or a life of being confined to the ocean?
...
I thought there might be more to the story?
Oh, okay!. I'm glad you had such a nice dream.
Cool, cool.. (* Interruption... *). (* Game design question: If you were playing Classroom Heroes two player mode, would you want your own VP count or a combined one? *). (* And also your own gingerAle or cheesePuff inventory? *)
Hmm.. you sure shared inventory would be that bad?. Might add an interesting dynamic between the pair of players.. And shared currency would allow players to "save up"
?. What do you man?. mean*
Yeah :P. That's why it requires co-op?. Do you have to be next to the poisoned player to use an antidote?. That could be a cool dynamic
Exactly!
Om nom!! I'm going to go eat soup (:
Ahh, don't eat the panda!
hehe
It looks like yummy soup!
Me after eating (:. How are you drawings going?. ***illustrations. I can't wait to cuddle you!! (:
Wow, the fox village!!!
Yes!!
:D !! Fun with Peter!!
How are the illustrations looking?
Toto...!
Not yet!. Text message?
Oh, I got it!. Nice drawing skills1
Me too :P. Well not the power part. Sweet dreams!
Congrats!
That's good :DD
I don't think I've received anything recently!. I liked Dorothy last night though!
Oh, okay1. !*
I like your illustrations! I didn't notice the mistakes (:. I'll be ready from 7pm-9pm, I think -- Do you think you'd have your book submitted by then?
Okay ^-^
Oh, interesting! I don't know specific details about the Wizard of Oz!
Oh no! We need more paper, stat!!. I think I am going to make shoes. I'm too used to going barefoot, that now it pains me to wear shoes :P
I am hoping for open toed shoes!. Haha, for real? :D!!!. I'm imagining a piece of material cut in the shape of my foot, and then straps holding it on my feet :P
Neat!. As long as it is really thin, more like suede?. But good traction. (not slick)
http://www.diyfootwear.com/huarache-sandals/. Suede is not so slippery. Not the cloth kind!. I could use the one you already had!. I still have some
I'll pick out the material and make something!
:P. I trust you!. I am going to head over to office hours now (:
Thank you!. I love you!! 9:
Do you mind me walking barefoot?
No, I like it! As long as you mean it!
Thanks!
Yum!! . Sorry I'm late!
How are you illustrations going?. Did you meet your deadline?
I enjoyed the last bunch!
Aw, tin man looks so sad.. What is in the tree?. Yes, the recent bunch!
Oh my :(
Oh good!!
Oh yeah?. That would be awesome! Maybe in about 15 minutes?
Oh good! I"ll make up something now!
When is your magazine due?. Also, that sounds like a ton of illustrations?!!!
Well then we can postpone planning to Tuesday or Wednesday
That sounds good!. I'm ready now, but I have a while, so I can wait for you to get food!

Let's pick this up another day. I'd rather not just find filler places.. I thought we were picking out places we specifically want to see
Also, I'm finding out how to get to Takayama/ Skirakawa now
That was already on my list
Still thee/???. there*?
Good night!
Still there!. ?*. I love you!!
7 * (30 minutes per illustration) = 3.5 hours!
Oh good morning!!!!
But fantastic!
I love you!
Oh my goodness, that's amazing!!!
I think I need the images further apart, or a really transparent line connecting the guy to his chair. Also having trouble with the frames of "poison bubbles". But I know how busy you are!. So this can wait
No, you are great!. My sprite unpacker just isn't smart enough!
Nah, you're awesome!. hehe. That's great.
The Alpha is due Wednesday night!
Sure thing! It'll be more polished by then, I bet
Oh no!
All the microusbs!!. Cut away the plastic :P. If you. re desperate. If it's even possible?. Maybe that's bad advice :P
Oooh! I like it so far!. Sweet dreams, Love :3
^-^ !!. Night night! Sleep tight!
^-^ How nice!. You've got this!
That blue is a nice blue (:. Night night! 
I preferred the solid navy to this blue!. Oh, they both look good!
I hope it goes okay!!
Oh, did they have somewhere to take a new pic?
Hehe, that'll be great!
I like it!. I'm heading over to class now!. Ttfn (:
Anytime!. No deadline
All of your best works since first year?
I like your pooh bear characters
A few of them are a bit too close together!
Wow, wow thank you1. !*. Do you have a program that autoname them?. I should've told you what to name them :P
Oh no, I'm sorry :P. Turns out I'm renaming them all something else
No, don't be sorry, just want you to know for future notice!
poison 01, poison 02, poison 03 would be great!. Don't worry, I found a way to "search and replace" file names!. Well.. how about bubble 01, bubble 02?
Thank you a bunch!!!!
Clock?
Ohh, I think I'll just these numbers for the alpha. I'm not sure what it should look like. Use. Free senior slideshow you could submit all your packaging designs. For your. And I like your bear and bear drawings
Physical copies exclamation point. Oh no
You can totally include stuff you've done outside of class!. Aka pooh bear. Ttfn, small group. Any last words?
Oh yeah :P Whoops. About that.... I love you too ^-^
Ah, the suspense!!. :P. What a dramatic pause.... I need more hugs, definitely!. (:. I haven't tested the new Floryan or bubbles yet, but the student is awesome :P
You are so fantastic  :D. Twice in one day? :P. Sweet dreams to you!
They do help!. RMS concert is this weekend!
Sleep tight (:
^-^
Good morning! . What are your plans for the day?
Sounds like a fun day!!
Well I hope it goes well then!!! (: Do you need more help choosing things?. Is there a list of possible options?
And Pooh bear characters!. And jewelry that you've made me!
Not til the final :P. Well.. beta. I think they look very finished :D. I have the jewelry you made me!
Whoa so cool!!!
I think it'd be cool on the start screen!. But you know, that's cool too!
I think it would be easier for me if there weren't :P
What do you mean "easier for you?". to play?
Oh, it'd be super easy for you!. In fact, you're basically done. I didn't explain it well enough earlier
I was going to incorporate it on the same screen. It's like a hidden feature.
Well, then I'll just put arrows above and below the character to show you can move up and down
Your title screen looks like a good thing that people see when looking at the game listing. But I'll let you know more over the weekend!
Oh cool1. Thanks a bunch!. Are you busy this weekend?
Oh wow!. No, it's not a problem, I just like to see your face!
Through the power of the internet?
Hehe, I was thinking of inviting you, but then your review!
Goodnight!!
Yes ;P. Working on alpha!
ready!. ...!
How about now?. I'm just about to go to sleep.... I'm going to get to sleep, but I'll be available in the morning!. Sweet dreams!
Good morning  $!
hehe :P That's ,e!. me*
Bed is so comfy!
hehe :P. I got you!!
Understandable!
Okay!! (: Good luck with it all!!
I do...!. I haven't arranged anything though, and I thought you might have to do some work on your puppets'
I could easily ask if anyone is using the study this weekend though!
Not until next year!
I'm about to do a poll on groupMe now to see whether I can invite you over!
At 3/10!. 4/10.... Suspense.. :P
4 out of 10 people approve of your visit so far.
Dun dun dun.. 5/10. :P. We will see
Want to go to the RMS concert with me?. I've never been without you!. Japan has the weirdest products... http://www.japantrendshop.com/facewaver-exercise-mask-p-1738.html
Better stock up on these face masks :P. hehe. OH man, it is possible to do advance things with your toes.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88jTVqh1lo8&nohtml5=False. I sort of want to learn, but I don't have as good of a reason.
Chopsticks..... The ultimate goal.. Have you seen this before?
She can fly an airplane with her feet!
<insert other click bait here>. Okay, have an awesome day!
:P You're a natural.
Hello!
Thank you!! I hope your day is going well too! (:. How did your review go?
Or I mean.. your portfolio
That's a very small point scale!
I love you!. (:. 8/10 so far!
Oh wow!! Getting fancy for your review? (:
Yay!
Oh cool!! (:
Christine Kim (cjk4wr), Leandra Irvine (lli5ba), Nakkul Sreenivas (ns3kb)
Just do alphabetical. Be sure to pack a tank top!
This weekend
I just sent you the invite...
Even when that is the theme of the party?
You have the red and white one!
:D Oh.... We will get you one!. :P
Ahh, please bring popcorn O.O. Ahh, the popcorn!. Also, you can plan to arrive at 3pm!
Om nom. The poison bubbles look great!!
RAWR!!!. *tackle*
At least there is some time!. Is it short?
Easy peasy!. You good to come 3pm tomorrow? (:
Cool! (:. No hurry if you need to nap beforehand or anything!
Sleep tight!
Sure! 
Could you paste it in?. "More recently..." this is a fragment, not a sentence.. Remove cartoon names. "Led me to create" instead of "led to creating" 
"Allow me to have" not "allow me" ( might be a grammatically correct form I am unfamiliar with though?. You use a lot of passive tones. *passive voice. So those could all be improved
"Fond of many mediums.." this sounds really distant-- like you are describing someone other than yourself. A lot of confusing verb tenses
But you do
Your mix of past and present tense is kind of weird. It's fine though. I'm sure you're not graded on how well written it is
I feel like it's missing a passionate voice though.. It sounds sort of uninspired. Not super exciting. Your message might be getting lost in the formality of it
Leant?. "You move with a physical object"?. Sorry, I'm tearing this apart :P. I can edit it tomorrow at 10am
Not at a computer now
I feel like it's way  verbose.. I could condense all your main points down . K... on computer now
I'm doing an overhaul now
It's not. But maybe my revisions will help you see how it more concise and grammatically undistracting (see what I did there?). it can be*
"because you move with a physical object". What are you trying to say here?
The last one should be fine
I hope I didn't kill your voice
Could you see how it might be better?. And does it still capture everything you were saying?. If you look at the two side by side, it might give you some ideas about conciseness.
People cut out all the unnecessary words out when trying to find meaning in sentences, so it is best to just do it for them.. Also, it tends to be a more pleasant reading experience.
For example... In this sentence "I had never made art with a computer before, and it was a completely different medium than what I was used to.", you are really just saying the same thing twice.. Ask me about how to write more concisely.. Sweet dreams!
Good luck with the rest!
Oh :P hehe, I wasn't expecting you to ask now.
Unless you want to learn now?
Night night!
Whhp, that was an accident! . Good morning!!. Let me know when you leave for Cville!!
Oh good!!
Yay! Let me know when you start heading out on the road, that way I can estimate your arrival time!
Thanks !! (:
https://www.tsunagujapan.com/20-delicious-japanese-ice-creams-and-popsicle-you-have-to-try-now/
It will be cold. https://www.google.com/?ion=1&espv=2#q=weather%2022904%20weekend. Bring workout clothes just in case. /sneakers
Neat!. Don't forget to get gas/ oil?
Hmm, We will be planning for Japan, doing homework. If you have any food that needs to be eaten, feel free to bring it :P. But I was hoping we could go grocery shopping together!
Aw (: Thanks!. Yay! I'll see you here.. I will be at the AFC (swimming). So I'll try and finish by 3:30pm. You can park and wait in your car at the AFC. (so you don't have to pay for parking), and I will meet you in the lot and we can go shopping from there!
See you soon1
Hi!
Good good! (:. You?. Haha, finally doing that assignment I was working on on Saturday. . "Working on"
I am currently working on this Text Mining thing due at midnight!. Everything else is on hold :P
Oh! Any idea where? I can go check!. I love you!! (:. I hope you have an awesome day!. Any possible preview of your puppets?
Hi!
I am good!!. And you? 
I am risking my health eating food that was left out overnight :P
I forgot to put it in the fridge ;(
Might take me out for a day...
But I"m fine for now!
Do you ever risk food safety?
Have you studied gmos?
Okay! I am definitely a gmo supporter (case by case), since I support science!
But why would we develop something that we don't think is an improvement?. hehe :P I know what you mean, I'm just being picky.
It's a good point though... we don't actually whether it is an improvement?. .*
I'm not too worried!. It's low on the global threats list
It's more on the solution side of things :D
Om nom!
I predict no. Food culture is so big!. Part of life! Om nm. nom*
Shorter preparation time is fine, but the eating process in not going anywhere!
Is eating food really that inconveniencing? :P. Seems more like a leisure activity. For us 1st worlders...
Again, that's based on food preparation pains. Not the actual consumption
That's a leisure/competitive activity also, not a method of saving time.
Also due to food obtaining issues, and not the actual consumption.. If food just materialized, it wouldn't make sense to skip eating. :P. in order to save time
Is that what you're doing now?. :P you can chew while you cut. I predict a slowdown of only %20, which will be evened out by the increase in productivity.
Man, I don't know what you're eating...
Maybe just take 2-5 minutes before you start cutting to eat it?
Okay, so there are people out there who would like this world of optional no eating.
Would you be interested in designing the statbox for the players?. Right now it is just words.
What sorts of other things?
You can't deny the importance and simplicity of improving the stat box!. I think it has a larger net gain :D. I'm imagining it as little icons that look like they are doodled in marker
One for a heart, one for vp, a little stick figure of the player with his name under it?
Those will just be numbers. You can also omit the name.
Just one heart, and we will programmatically draw it multiple times. Also tiny ginger ale and bomb icons?
Thanks! I will take anything ^-^
That would be cool!. By tomorrow afternoon is fine!. We could just reuse the vp, ginger ale and bomb icons technically.. That just leaves a heart :P
That looks cool!. Might be better resolution if we just scale down the ginger ale and cheese puff icons
Well you are the artist!
Thank you! :D In the Google drive folder is good. How are you?
hehe
That is true!
Good morning!! . I love you too (:
I can easily scale it if I want since you gave me the picture!
I'm trying to think of a good timer mechanism
Thanks. Have a good class!!
I sure will :D
No, I'm not sure of the font importing process, but I'm sure java graphics library has something more suitable than the one we've been using
Thank you!
In the preview the player1 bar looks black?
Thanks for adding those!. They are so tiny O.o
And they will be scaled up even more in-game!. :D
Player-2-Bar. and Player-1-Bar
They are for selecting which mode you want to play on
I hope they don't appear that black in the game!
Okay, so the selection bakes the background darker?. That makes sense!. Thanks!
If you ever need a 1 hour distraction.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU3vqkPFJi8
Oh cool!. It's my favorite!
:3. I'm still alive from the food I ate!
Which kind do you need? I bought one, but don't have any plans for ut
I haven't eaten it, but I'm not sick!. I totally forgot!
I have this preventative measure where I gurgle with listerine.. I don't know if it does anything though!
Thanks for reminding me!
:P. Noo, that makes it worse!
After a quick google search about "gargling with Listerine," it seems to be generally unconfirmed or untrue.. I'll take the placebo effect though!. It's "worked" for me a few times before :P. But maybe I wasn't going to get sick anyway...
"Come and join us on Thursday April 14, 2016 for our ANNUAL NICKEL CONE DAY!!! We will be open from 11am-9pm at both of our locations. Pantops and WoodBrook. Don't miss out on a FIVE CENT cone.". Kohr bros :D!
Om nom nom
Do you have class on Friday?. :P
Of course :D. But no class, eh?
It's real!!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm9lWCW_HZM. No, that would be silly.... (From Big Hero..)
One per person!
I'll try and catch a ride with my housemates,
Yes!
Did you know there is a team at UVa though? :D. Flamethrower!!?!
They are both good!
The game looks about the same as when you saw it!. I am working on the student hitbox now
I love you too!!
Yes!! That song so good!. I think I sent that accidentally!. I woke up without shorts on :P
I don't know, maybe the elastic is getting too loose :P
Oh!! That makes sense!
:D. I had super cool dreams about beauty and the beast and large molecular ray guns!
:D!. Japan has an owl cafe..?. :D
Thanks!
Goodnight!! (:
Good morning!!. I have a ride over today!. I estimate I'll be at your show by 6:15pm! How long is the show?
Oh good!!
Aw :(. Looks more like 6:30pm. Where is the show? 
Thanks!. I'll try and be there by 6:30 or 6:40!!
Aw, thank you! 
Goodnight Peter :D Get ready for back seat adventrues!
If you don't have time to make sandwiches, just bring the ingredients and a plastic knife and maybe some paper plates/napkins for tomorrow!
With kisses! :3
And cuddles!!. Please :3
:D!!!
.... !
Nah, I don't think you should come over!
I'm working on that now!
It might be a little inefficient, because it will be hard to communicate what we find!
Yeah, I can do it!
Nah, don't worry about it!
Thanks. Make sure to check whether it is difficult to get to and easy to get to other place from it.. Look at what transport we might need on the island, etc
The bookings you listed look good.. Do you have the length of time it takes to get from it to Miyajima?. We could make day trips there since it is covered by JR rail, but only if it is an hour or less commute
How long is the total trip time?. walking + train + ferry
Do you mind the long walk from the airbnb to the JR station?. 20-25 minutes.
What is the price if we take the tram? (since not covered by JR rail). I don't mind the walk either!
I mean from Takasu station to Miyajima pier. I'm getting $6 for one day per person.. It's not too bad to walk though, so I think I'd prefer the walking option!. If you want to look ahead for Izu (28th-30th) I'll take Takayama. We were looking at Shirahama beach, but I'd be open to other places as long as they are along the train network
Yup
I have to go soon for the street festival, and then driving home... Here are the places so far if you want to write a message to book:. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10910995?guests=2&s=yfhi-jA0&check_in=2016-05-11&check_out=2016-05-14.

I like the one you picked for Takayama. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11447736?checkin=05%2F25%2F2016&checkout=05%2F28%2F2016&guests=2&s=a5O2utyX. From the planning doc "overnight in Izu Peninsula Shirahama beach (shimoda-shi)"
"Shimoda-shi"
Shift everything over one day.... Tokyo https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10910995?guests=2&s=yfhi-jA0&check_in=2016-05-11&check_out=2016-05-13.

That would be awesome!. You can use my account and credit card. 6011004074795481. 12/19. Security code is at top of Planning doc. $1500 cap
No, whatever you write is fine!
Just convey respectfulness/friendliness. And also some of our main interests in each place.. Say we are students, etc. Interested in experiencing Japanese culture and seeing some of the main sites in the area. Thank you!!. You can use your own airbnb account, it should be fine :D
Yeah, that's finr
Add that we are respectful, quiet guests...
All good things. Are you linked with FB?
Also interested in pocket wifi, if you haven't sent yet. Same for with the other listing that mention the pocket wifi
What does that mean?
Who is Nobu?. Oh Tokyo
Sounds good!
Make sure same as Google sheet
The budget 
In the folder
Japan
Says 7 have accrs. Says u
Shared with justsomepita
Thanks
No, the list includes izu qnd tokyo. Set those to 0
Okay good!. Thanks
Stopping at your house soon!. Left my half eaten sandwiches :P
In 1 min
Thank you!!1
After my 8:30 meeting!. So maybe like.. 9:30 or 10
They were delicious!!!!. :D!. I ate them during the car ride.. Traffic was pretty intense this time around :P
Somehow, you had more expensive rates than me for some of the listings!
For Kyoto, I had $474, but you had $488, and for Takayama, I had $156, but you had $161. Not a big difference, but kind of weird!
The rest were the same for me
I just wrote it down wrong :P
Who knows!. But it's fine, maybe the price changed since I had loaded the page
Yeah!. So happy. Okay, time for work!
Hmm.. We could always use more backgrounds for the 4 new levels!
Good question... I take a picture of the lab tomorrow. There are only two locations in our class, so the other 3 will have to be imagined
We could just make him float for now and see how it looks :P. I need to design an end game screen. And design a few levels. And design the timer
Well, it needs to be clear how much time they have left.. And I can do any scaling through the game engine.
Well I could just make something similar to the Blogilates timer. But without numbers. And it changes colors when there is less time left. I don't need any graphic/animation for that though.. I could just program the color changes, etc.. I have a feeling it will just end up being a circle with a big number in it :P
But of couse!. course*
Me either :P. A new classroom background, if you want?
http://www.graphics.com/article-old/find-and-replace-colors-photoshop. You could make more varieties of students!. Using this spritesheet (so they are all in the same position)
Could just have different skin, shirt, or hair color. You could make candy projectiles for the secret bonus Weimer reskin of the game. And the different "boss" characters if you want
http://www.graphics.com/article-old/find-and-replace-colors-photoshop. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207308434928101&set=a.1429016804395.2056635.1202074688&type=3&theater. https://www.facebook.com/david.amin.35?fref=ts
It can just be the front facing one
And professor weimer of course!. What do you mean by "parse"?
Is it .png format?
Rock ;. And prof Weimer! https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/student-renderings/raw/weimer-casey-comic-3.jpg. He carries a fencing sabre
No, the real Weimer :P. I'm going to get to sleep!. Just the front is fine for the characters.. I'm not sure what they are doing yet!
With a slight modification in url... http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/. Sweet dreams!
I love you too!
Good morning (:
I love you too!!!. :D
Haha :P
Needs fencing sword!. Lighter hair?. Face looks a bit off
But pretty cool!. He normally wears hiking boots
This is the only image I have of it right now, but it's a super close up. There's a little podium/computer setup on the right. And a chalkboard behind the projector screen
There are rows of desks/chairs (no aisle separating the desks). The podium is not as important as the background!
They are indeed gray and thin
We're not currently using the tables right now  :P So you can keep that secondary, but we will see!!. I'm resuming progress on the game now with implementing the title screen!
"I will mention that I wear this same outfit to weddings, to job interviews, etc. Indeed, the only significant change is jeans (hiking, fencing, etc.) vs. pants. The sun and I don't get along, and the mock turtleneck keeps it off my arms and neck. I wear the hiking boots because I like hiking and walking. Basically, all of the choices come down to convenience and utility: it minimized my time spent on the issue (e.g., if all of my socks are the same color, I can pull any two at random without sorting) and supports my desired activities. Finally, I personally prefer blue, black and green to colors like yellow or orange, so I would rather see them when I look down.   There are a number of potential issues here (e.g., why wear X, why not wear Y, why do humans wear certain things at all) and I'll just pick one of them for now.   People often wonder how or why I could wear a non-formal outfit for a job interview or funeral or the like. It turns out that there are a few different ways to show respect. Across human cultures ("I should take more cultural anthropology classes ... should be more hands"), the most common deferential modes (imploring, low status to high status, etc.) involving spending extra time with more flowery words or gestures. You can see this directly in languages like Japanese, but you can also get a feel for it in English. If you're really begging someone ("oh great king, would you be so kind as to grace us with the boon of your wisdom" vs. "so, tell me the answer") you literally spend longer to say or phrase it -- you use longer words and more of them. You expend more effort than is strictly necessary to get the idea across. The implicit argument here is that you are showing them respect by giving up your time: you are taking an action that has no actual use (phrasing questions the longer way doesn't plow the fields or catch the fish or whatnot ... it just takes your time) aside from destroying a limited resource (your time) to show that you value someone else. It is the verbal equivalent of asking someone to bow before you -- it does nothing, but it takes their effort, and you know it is taking their effort and that the only reason they would do it (recall: it does not grow crops, it just costs time) is because they think it will make you react more favorably. You can see this same issue in formal wear across cultures. While not all cultures agree on what formal wear is, it almost invariably involves costly, high-quality materials that take time to put on correctly (or are otherwise more restrictive). So while this Indian-style suit may not the same as the "usual" Western Armani (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/dc/ba/54/dcba543d6167a1f4cb562812a47b4d32.jpg), it has those same attributes: it involves costly materials and takes your time. You can see the same in modern-traditional African, Chinese or Arabic fashion as well, to pick just three other examples.   Dressing up in this manner is one way of showing respect. The rarely-explicit argument is "I will give up my time and other resources to dress in a manner that you/society are expecting, and it is this very expenditure of resources that shows that you are important to me: this is concrete evidence that I am paying something for your favor." You can see parallels to this argument when considering why "homemade gifts" or "hand wrapped gifts" and the like are usually valued more highly: after a certain salary of standard of living, two hours to manually craft something for someone is a much bigger cost than $50. The time invested is more of a resource, and thus that gift conveys more respect (you have given up more of your life for the recipient).   This general approach is the most common way of showing respect that I have encountered in the world.   I am not a fan.   (This is potentially predictable from previous posts, such as the morality one in which I came out strongly in favor of reality over perception: shooting the messenger or asking for different wording does not change the underlying problem.)   Instead, I believe the way I can best show someone respect is to tell or present the truth. (A partial explanation for this is that I believe rationality and science are the best tools currently available for predicting the outcomes of actions and thus achieving your goals, and thus many of the most helpful actions I can take involve helping you obtain an accurate model upon which to base your predictions.) Take the job interview. I interviewed at UVA (and MSR, and NYU, and a bunch of other places) wearing the same outfit I wear to teach (hiking boots and all). I could either show hiring committees respect by spending time and resources on a suit, or I could show them respect by giving them accurate information. I do not do research in a suit. I do not write papers in a suit. I do not teach or advise students in a suit. Why be misleading in a job interview? Instead, I show them respect by showing myself as I actually am. When phrased in the contrapositive, it may become clearer: if the only way I could get the job at UVA would be presenting myself in a suit instead of as I am (i.e., if that single action is the difference between yes and no), I don't want that job. (Did this work? Read the grad job guide linked on my webpage for details if you're curious.)   As mentioned elsewhere on the forum (I believe), morality is at its most interesting when it could cost you something. It's easy to say "I would never kill a purple unicorn" -- they don't exist (sorry, Casey). A commitment to presenting myself as I am becomes much more interesting when it has the potential to cost me a job.   So that's the brief version of "why don't you ever dress up?". If you're bored, remind me before the end of the semester to go over the logic puzzle involving this issue -- it's a bit of an advanced analysis, however, so I'm afraid that I don't have time now.". Words of wisdom. And weird auto-gen picture...
Eh. .... I think the author would not be a fan.
So just reading it out of your own interest would be more respectful.. And not in order to "take up your time"
Our beta is due on Wednesday, but the animation doesn't have to be perfect!
You can focus on your own classes!. We can work with what you've made so far!. Something that we need most might be an instruction screen. But it needs to be made in a way that we can easily edit the instructions. Also if you could make the backdrop for the controls, that would also be cool!
Something so they can see what the controls map to
That's the control mapping screen
The instruction screen tells the player what poison and vp are, and what the objective is. I would've liked to work this in with an animation, but it will take awhile
Yeah. But you don't have to. Either way
Nah, I guess we could easily make the instructions if we have the icons (which we do), and the different sprites.... We would just need a pretty background to put it on, then. :P. And it's fine if find and replace color doesn't work
Ah, who needs variety :P. Longer net, or nah?
Oh yay, thank you!. Oh no, such blurry. Looks good in the preview though. :P. Hehe, milk mustaches
It's sooo blurry
That's because it's not taking up your entire screen!
It you want to, but man, that is a lot of sprites! So you don't have to :P. Save that for the internet release.. Do you still have the hallway background?
Oh good!. I was hoping you could move the door on the bottom right of the hall to the left side bottom because the player will be coming out of the classroom there. I think?
Yeah!. So I need the little shadow to be on the left, if you could!. I tried so hard to do this on sketch.io, but it was hard :P. I should be able to
I mean, the shadow should be on the left, but it is on the right
You exit from the left and progress to the right. Because going toward the right is a sign of progress
Yay, thanks for sending that!. I totally makes sense because you come out of the classroom at the top of the room, but the viewpoint is shifted further down the hall each time...
T-3 weeks to plane flight!!
;(. (:. :). Smileys have gotten too smart!. Now they detect both direction o.o!
It's like... a few extra characters of code.
Hehe, "fair amount of research". Nah, I was expecting to get a different one, but they didn't have it.. I like this one a lot, and I'm happy I got it!. Samsung Galaxy for the win
Just don't get the one with the beveled edges... not worth it!
It's impractical. I mean this : "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/02/a47a7bcf-b803-4bbb-835c-c60067253d7f/resize/1170xauto/0cfb57d9bfc0b91b8824f8ac87557b01/samsung-galaxy-note-edge-product-photos24.jpg"
It looks cool in person, but I can't imagine using it all the time!
RAWR!!!. *tackles*
No, the one you made is fine :D
Yes! The hair sheen!. So flippy!
I approve!
No, I think the longer net is more important!. Was it very easy to do the find and replace with color?
It would be cool if I could send you the player1 spritesheet to turn green once it is put together and then I can reuse the specs-file.
Oh hmm...
Yup yup!
Whoa whoa whoa...!
hehe ,thanks! I will try it out!
Together?
Nah, this is good!. Are they far enough apart?
Sweet dreams to you!! Thank you for the assistance!
Good morninh!. Hehe, since when is 10:50pm an early bedtime?
What what? :P
Send a screens hot 
I didn't notice anything wrong!. That's the one we've been using in the game
As long as it doesn't change the positioning or chair size
Need more pics :D
Get all of them! :P. Special Request!. Go to the source O.O
Oh, neat project! Did you watch through the whole video?
Yes, that's the room from the front!. **from the back :P
We could do without it and be fine!. Perhaps it would be easier to just change the floor color
That sounds like a great idea!
Okay!
https://chp.tbe.taleo.net/chp04/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=GAMES2K&cws=1&rid=641&source=Glassdoor Job of the day!. But who wants to live in Ohio?. Oh, just kidding, this one is California!
Oh!!. I hope you have very sweet dreams!. (:
Thank you!!
Do you have class right now?. Well I have your schedule at home  :3
I hope you have a good water color class!
Hehe
Nice boss sprites!. Is the one with messy hair Nick?
Well thanks! They look great!. Is it possible to make an arrow pointing up? It might have a cool animation too. The point of the arrow is so that the player knows to leave the classroom out the door after the level is over. So it might be "wiggling" a little. I don't quite remember how it looks in games!. It's like a ... "Go this way!". I think I just need one in the up direction, and then I can reuse it!
Awesome!! Thanks, you!. Just implemented throwing! It loooks great!. There is also one other TA. I guess I wouldn't want him to be left out... but hmm... He's on the left.. I never see him though... so he's maybe one of the non-participatory :P
The animation.. :D It'd be convenient if all the frames were the same size. Oh, a higher priority thing.... The smokebomb frames are different sizes, which makes it a bit tricky to animate! Would you mind sending individual frames?. This happens also with the paper animation, unfortunately!
If it's more time consuming on your side though, I have a solution that will work for the notebook, and it only takes about 5 minutes! So just the smokebomb, then!. Thanks a bunch!
Thanks! The arrow is great!
That's weird.. the "wooden-tables" aren't far enough apart to parse apart, even though it looks like there are pixel gaps!
Sweet!!. I have a theory that this spritesheet parser can't handle the break in the outline of the table. Who knows!
That would be pretty cool!. Just 4 different styles is fine. Thanks for doing the bag and smoke
Aww ^-^
Thanks!
I have a favor!. Could you make a background screen that is 574 x 322?. For the instructions. With a background that is light enough so that black font is displayed. Well, I guess I can do this part!. I did it :D. Though it definitely doesn't look like I want it to :P
It sounds good at first, but when I start thinking about the meaning it falls apart. No worries, we are turning in our Beta soon!
Could you send door sized clip of the classroom2 floor?. And yup!. If you're not busy. door sized png**
No, just the floor, so I can put it behind the door when it opens
Yup. No, the classroom 2 floor
I need 48x52. :(. Sorry I didn't specify
Thank you!
Also, classroom1 background is missing the door :P. I know I'm supposed to add it, but I don't have time :(. It doesn't look too bad, but a little funny
Thanks, it's missing the clock though. But that's fine!
I'm not totally sure :P. We submitted, so now the rest of the changes will be in the final!
Thanks a bunch! (:
It's looking pretty cool!!
I love you so so so much!!!!. Want to play?
No worries! :D. It is on the Google drive
Did it work? :D
Cool!
Did you download all the resources with it?. And is it in a folder next to the jar?
:P Did you get stuck, or could you never move?. Did you make it past the title screen?
You mean it shows up before the victory screen is over?
Which Keys did you use? Perhaps Windows has different key mappings than Mac. victory spin*
Okay, thanks for the feedback. Someone on the internet somewhere
I'm not sure
We like his size because it give the player more room to move. gives*
He is scaled .7
No, it's fine
I did, but he blocks the while board stats. white*. Or takes up too much room on the play area. I gotta go!
Thanks for your input. Have an awesome day!
Oh, did you manage to get past?. Yeah, it looks a little funny!
I am cycling through 1, 2, 3. Is the walk sequence just two frames?
Oh yeah, let me know what the player 2 mapping should be. AWSD for arrow keys, and then which should be the primary and secondary buttons?. Remember, the player is using two hands.
Yes, like a controller
Well, I'll make a page so they can choose key mappings
Just need some button graphics
And a highlight over the button
Cool!. In that case, I just need an arrow key button layout. and then two single buttons
Oh, I can start a text file in the google drive!. Thanks a bunch!. Did you have any ideas for the instruction page background?
The green one is a bit tackier than I expected. :P. Final is new next week. due*. Well, technically May 3rd, but I am optimistic!
Haha, that's what the Beta was for :P
I'm not going to fix the walking animation. I think it's low priority
The hitbox is huge so that you can't get too close to the spawn point. It would be cool if he sort of "pushed you away" instead of just not being able to walk there
I don't think it happen by the final though.. #1 priority for me is ability to replay a level, and improved end game screen. And instructions page/control mapping. What is wrong with the walking animation, by the way?. I don't see a noticeable difference between stand, walk vs just walking. I'll try my best!
That's if you're going in a diagonal, right?
Yeah, that's because it's not enough time to start an animation. What would be your solution?
Or, what should the behavior be instead?. Is what I mean
Which is sprite 3 vs sprite 1?. You mean like.. pick up the animation based on the last frame?
That sort of makes sense..
Thanks, I'll try and do that. It would just involve saving the last frame, I think!. Instead of starting from 0
I set the delay based on whether the sprite is still playing the animation :P I could fix it by adding more frames of the stand to the end
Sound sgood!
Ttfn :D
Have fun in Art history
Hi Peter!
I am at breakdancing practice!
I am !!. What are you up to?
Knowing yourself is one of the most valuable skills you can have!
The walking has been thusly corrected!
It wasn't, but it was an easy fix!. Sweet dreams!
Good morning!. Nick and David like their sprites! But Nick would prefer to wear purple
Thanks Peter! You're a great teammate ^-^
It looks great! I don't need anything displayed on the keys, though!
Whoa, thank you!!. It totally depends on what the website is about!. Up for a call?
Probably your name!
Shorter is good!
Did you get any new Radford e-mails?
From Domain.com?
Okay
Nah
Oh, I'm going to go shower!
hehe :P
Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too!
I love you!!!
Good morning!
(:. Happy Saturday!
Did you want to chat?. I'm just cooking food!. (speakerphone, perhaps(
Yum, leftovers!
That sounds declicious!. delicious*. Looks like it's come time for me to crank out two more game ideas
I will use the animal transformation idea, and then I only need one more!
Haha, thanks. Awesome idea!
That. s a good idea, but I'm familiar with that minigame from Mario Party already
http://www.mariowiki.com/Crane_Game_(minigame)
It's only on N64, so we must've played that one together!
I think so?. Or I might've played it with a friend
I could just make an educational physics game!
I still need some graphics for the end level screen, and also a final screen for winning the game
Nah. Oh! Is it possible to make the green shirt character from the red character sprite sheet?. A background for the instructions screen is also needed. Oh, I'll send it through the drive
Don't you worry about that!. (:. Just the two characters are fine
There are other graphics that are more necessary.. The TAs might need some sort of standing animation. Like, a slight up and down movement?
Nah. Do you enjoy making the character sprites. ?
There was an idea of having different professors. But you wouldn't have to make the throwing for all of them, it could just be the front facing rotations. Like weimer
I prefer the higher res look. But you are the designer
We'll just make the character bigger then. sprite*
We need the instructions background/ end game screen/ end level screens first, so I'm not sure if you'd have enough time for so much work
Rawr!!!
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z8k0rC6D32lWS3Lz2P3WYxAuA-JNZXDVTRxJ7LojoBc/edit
Maybe your first question?
The instruction background just needs to be a background. Some thing that will support having sprites overlayed on top of it. The font can be white, if that works better. Or  it can be black. You don't have to make any of the contents
Right now we are using that funny white and green gradient. The letter/number pngs aren't easy to programatically incorporate. A .ttf file would be the best, but even that would take awhile to figure out
I think that works too. There's probably a good pixel font online already
Thanks!. How are your classes going?
Sorry I never called. I missed your message and thought it was too late
They are going well! Definitely manageable if I continue to keep working today and tomorrow!
Thanks
I am really excited about this shapeshifting game!. Is there something like this already?
"All morph forms can move.  Your other abilities depend on which form you are in.  Each form has one other type of movement (either jump, duck, or fly), and a special action that you can control (carrying civilians, knocking through walls, summoning other animals to help you).  In addition, forms will have different interactions with the environment (can pass through water, can pass by enemies undetected).". ".  I plan to make the game so that multiple animals will work for multiple different obstacles, that way the player has meaningful choice.  There are consequences and benefits associated with each animal, so some players might begin to pick favorites based on which abilities they value most in the game (flying to avoid obstacles, strength to have more fun breaking through things, etc). "
Adorable. I'll think about it later :P. I'm making a level prototype now
2d
Not pixel art :P
Oh, no problem! We're not making an entire game now :P. Have a safe drive to Radford!
Nah, not until after Classroom Heroes!
Ah, such attitude!. :P. Let's plan the last few days of our trip tonight!
animals!. https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298123-d1196864-Reviews-Izu_Shaboten_Park-Ito_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Chubu.html
They are!
Maybe maybe!
Neat!
Sounds like a fun project!. But don't offer to do things if you don't want to!. I've learned that it's best to assume that if someone is offering, then they want to help, and not just be nice.. Don't let my assumption be false :P. That being said, you can always enlist a friend, or say you can't do it if it seems like too much!
Neat!. How was Radrod?. Radford*
Wow, good for you for taking initiative! Learning how to manage people is good.. Sweet dreams to you!. When you take initiative, you are the one who needs to get people to help and hold people accountable, remind people, etc.. It's hard!. Sleep well :D
Couldn't you just shift the entire color cycle over until you are yellow?
Hehe, aren't you the one designing this? You should be yellow if you want to be !. Wishing you yellow. ..- Leandra
Just add an extra blank autograph page to make up for the color shift :0
Is yellow your favorite color?
Good morning!
No worries! I added some ideas to the Google doc 
You can see the revision history! I just added some links for Izu at the top of the page
Do you have any extra, 3A 125V adaptors ( like for ps2)?
It is for my laptop!
It looks like the same adaptor for my DVD player, projector, and sewing machine too!
Oh, it is rounded on each side! Whoops
I'm okay! I hope you've had a nice day too!. What did you do today?
No problem! I hope the layouts are going well!. Don't worry about the graphics so much!. You've been such an awesome help. Today we had our showcase and then I did homework and misc activities.
I was going to say goodnight, but I'm just studying for abit
Good night!
I love you too!!!!!!!!!!. :3
Good morning!
Hi there!
I skimmed all the slides and fell asleep! I'm going to study between 1-5pm too!
What is up for you?
Simultaneously? . Or they all have the same due date?
Sounds like a good plan!. Don't forget about the feet
Neat! When are classes over?
Fun!!
Oh good!
(:
That would be cool!
Whoa!! What test?. That sounds good!!
That would be really cool!
Oh good :D!. By the way, what time/where is your graduation?
Okay, awesome!. Also, is your passport tracking number up yet?
This link, right? https://passportstatus.state.gov/opss/OPSS_Status_i.asp
Cool cool!. Taking action after 3 weeks seem reasonable.. I've heard you can call your Congressman's office (Griffith) first. If that doesn't work, then DC passport agency (only open week days). They have same day processing if you are leaving the country in less than two days.. So Monday, you would get there right when it opens.
Walk-ins are an option.
Whenever is fine!. What is an "Art book"?
Wow, so much art!! (:
I look forward to seeing it!. What time are you coming on Friday?
It's all relative :P
Does she have a friend she is staying with?
Oh neat! Which one?
How is your day going?
It's great!. Had the last figure skating practice of the semester this morning!
And ate a yummy cupcake ^-%. ^-^
Then classes where I gave a presentation in one class, and took an unforgivable test in another class!
And then I went to a Capital One security presentation, and then went to the last small group of the semester!
Then I spent the rest of the time taking my OWL Exam .  I passed!
I'm a wizard!
I just cannot think of any games that I don't like :P. Or games that need improvement.. There must be something out there
It was fine, it just got old quickly!. For reasons unrelated to game quality!
Thanks for helping me brainstorm, though.
Thanks!
Sweet dreams!
Good morning!!. :D. Jinx!. I love you : 3
Or sushi!
Oh no, I had one the other day...! At a dining hall
Ah, disappointment... you meet again..!. Could always start fresh and redo it!
Oh!! Or make the mistake into a feature!. hehe, I made a mistake in art class once on purpose so I could use this trick
Or just play it off like there's no mistake!
Which is the same as the above suggestion, but without doing anything extra.. Hehe, in cases where it's not threatening, I do it all the time!. Yup, totally meant to do that...
Works well when public speaking!
Rock those mistakes :D
Adds character ^-^
Well, I given my suggestions. Sympathy, then?
:P hehe, someone made one for our class after that test we took yesterday.
Too bad it's immortalized inaccurately for the duration of the website's cache!. :P
I hope you have a great day too!. And thanks :D
If I had a dog...! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9Fyey4D5hg. ahh, there's more!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PztO-OvzRyg
Dog training sounds like fun!!
Stressful? Nah, just repetitive. Dogs are great stress relief
Nah
Okay!. Before we leave?
Definitely!  Watch out for the "edge"!
That's the one with the curved screen 
No way, what about your earlier comment?
About the curved screen being silly
You are wise!. Thanks for helping me look! Our check out date is June 2nd. Right? :P. Thank you so much for helping!!
I'm just submitting one of my assignments and then I will be on the case!. How are your watercolor paintings?
So, are you coming on Thursday?
Whoops, it's getting a bit late!. I seem to have gotten a piece of glass stuck in my foot :P
Oh good! Got it out using your swiss army knife
(tweezers)
I'll put some ointment on it
I didn't even notice though :P
Oh that's interesting... I have little sticks stuck in my other foot too.. Decided to check while I was at it...
Got em!. Yeah, that might be a good idea :P
To wear?
I think I should just wear shoes again, most likely!. I'm going to get to sleep and do Japan in the morning! . Sweet dreams (:
What time should I expect you on Thursday, if at all?. I do have some things planned on Friday already. What times will you be in town?
I am busy from 10am-1:00pm. on Friday. Is your sister's test all day?
Well the two of us could definitely hang in the AM. And then you and your sister could get lunch together?. I have my lunch function tomorrow with Capital One. *on Friday. Let's get to sleep ^-^. Sweet dreams!. But let me know what you think
 You need a ladybug hero!
Oh neat. But the other things on the list are more important. They are ordered by priority
Okay! The eyes look kind of funny! Did you mean to make them like this? ^_^
Oh whoops, I thought it was squinty eyes because they are Asian :P
Maybe after everything else on the list over the summer!. Have fun in class!. Last ones!
She can just stay for free as long as it is just Thursday night. I will ask my house ASAP to see if it is alright. I think if she needs to stay Friday too, that would be OK, but I'd need to know ahead of time. Haha, capital case abbreviation. .. I'll try and clean ahead of time. It's definitely not luxurious, maybe if you have a small air mattress, it will be better?
So just Thursday night you mean?. What is Paige's estimated arrival time?
Okay, let me know as soon as you can!. I think I have decided between where we should stay... In Ito!. Here:. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8993012?checkin=05%2F28%2F2016&checkout=05%2F30%2F2016&guests=2&s=0pQtrg3Q. If we want lots of interactions, recommendations from our hosts!
Or this one, which looks inexpensive, and well located. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7517169?check_in=2016-05-28&guests=1&check_out=2016-05-30
Aw, not again! :P. Well, more comparable to the other place then
Yeah! Would you prefer the extra guidance/host interaction though?. (of the first listing)
I mean, we might save on transportation or breakfast if we stay with the other hosts. I'm not interested in the pottery
No, pottery is cool, but I can do that anywhere.
I'd rather enjoy the scenery/attractions.
Whatever is practical for you to pack!They might be able to hook us up with some. scuba diving...!
I would be happy at either location too. I may contact them and ask about scuba diving in the area.. Well I should.
Though I am reluctant :P
I think I can work something out!. Thanks a bunch though!
^-^ Awww! You :D
At your graduation?
I'm just planning the weeks schedule, and then back to sleep!
Sweet dreams!. Good morning!
Here is the response I got from Joelle:  Hello Leandra, Thank you for your interest in our house. To answer your questions, yes I know scuba diving instructors who rent gear. No problem there, it really the place for diving. Usually they even to pick you up so no worry about transportation. As for visiting the places you mentioned they are all situated quite near so we usually take people there with our car. We can explain also to use the train, the stations are very near. Do not worry we will give you all the help you need. Hoping to see you soon. Kind regards Joelle. Also, instead of Pocket Wifi-- I am going to get the 2GB for 30day sim card at the air port. It is only 34000 yen, and I think it will be all we need for in between places!
How does Futo sound? Would you be up for scuba diving?
Yeah, definitely!. I probably will not, since I'll be gone all week!
I felt pretty comfortable with it, but I definitely think the refresher course would be good if you are worried!
Woo!! All booked ^-^. Well, almost. I'm waiting for my CC Payment to process until I book the last place!. Oh hey..!! If there is anything you need to buy before the trip, now is the time to do it.. As an example, I am buying sd cards for my cameras!. I am waiting to see if I might need anything else, so I'll probably order tomorrow!
Cool! That's probably enough to get free shipping, so we don't have to combine. Also, I have a JC Penney $50 gift card if there are any decently priced shoes from there that match your needs!. http://www.ebay.com/itm/The-North-Face-Amira-Backpack-Purple-EXCELLENT-CONDITION-/141971916177?hash=item210e2f8591:g:-DUAAOSw-RRXCyLz. My dream backpack!. The one I would have gotten if I were able to find it 4 years ago :D. I like how the black turned out though
Whoa!!! What amazing news!. You can look at their website too!
Those are hiking boots!!. aren't*
You're welcome to get what you want, but just want you to be comfortable! :D!!
I'm definitely looking forward to the trip!. Is someone going to use your cool camera to take your graduation pictures?
I saw that one. It's a different model. I am not bringing hiking boots to Japan, but thanks
I have tennis shoes. Hiking boots are pretty biulky, plus it won't be very cold
Whatever you are most comfortable in!. :D
Happy Saturday!. Are you going to the jewelry lab?. It was neat getting to see your water colors!
Good question!  What are you working on at the lab?
:D!!
Pictures?
Thanks! That looks really neat!. Sweet dreams!
The list is the same! Also, I hope the tin copper man went well!!. Hello Leandra, As everything  seems to fit I made the reservation for you (2 persons). Everything is included. So now  they would like to know   - your height in cm for both - your weight in kg for both - and the size of your feet in cm  for both. This is to find a suit to best fit you. Thank you for sending me these informations. Kind regards Joelle.. Apply to this! Easy-peasy application form! (just resume and transcript_. http://airbnb.design/airbnb-design-fellowships/
Probably sucessful!. successful*. Is Laika definitely your dream job? If you want to work there, you could work your way up in the field.
Did you already read all of these? https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Laika-Inc-Reviews-E221728.htm
Sounds like they have a lot of internal problems (bad mobility, organization), poor employee benefits.. Is it really your dream job? Isn't there somewhere higher to aim for?
I guess it depends what is important to you in your job. But most people want credit where it is due, and a chance of promotion!. And also a happy work environment :D. But I'm sure Laika has the latter (hopefully). Besides all the manager issues.
It's at 5pm. I'm happy to brainstorm with you about future planning whenever you like!
There's nothing on there that you haven't already made!
Everything on the list. I also need some way of telling people which button to press to go back to the main screen from the instructions page or the controls page
Maybe an arrow pointing left in the bottom left corner of the screen, and then a blank key next to it where I can put the name of the key to press?
Your measurements?
Interesting precision! Were you using calipers?
Would you mind sending just to one decimal point? Sig figs, Peter!
It's dependent on the uncertainty of your instrument!
What do you mean?
Oh, I haven't seen them yet!
The words seem pretty useful! If you could include both with and without words, that would be so awesome!. By the way, do you have any Japan travel adaptors?. The universal ones should work
Okay. I have one.. With more research, it looks like the adapter is the same, but the voltage is 100V instead of 120V. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2225.html. Also, three prong adapters will not work, and if the pins are different sizes, you may have trouble!. Please send me the link to the last Tokyo airbnb listing!. Also, what are the Kyoto dates?
Thanks. Is it 11th to 14th?. I mean.. 14th to 22nd?. Also, what is the link for the airbnb?
Thanks. I mean the listing link.
The listing for Tokyo, I mean :P
Wait.. Kyoto 13th-21st.. then Hiroshima? and Takayama 25th-28th?
Oh no :*(. We are missing a day. No where to stay on the 27th
So sad. Much fail
That's okay :P Have a safe drive!!. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12295463?checkin=05%2F27%2F2016&checkout=05%2F28%2F2016&guests=2&s=PhaDpAAeHow. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12295463?checkin=05%2F27%2F2016&checkout=05%2F28%2F2016&guests=2&s=PhaDpAAe. How is this one?
Thank you!!. It is going well!. I am just working solo since we put of the meeting until tomorrow. Thank you!. Would you be okay to book the apartment with your script?
Thanks!. I am getting $53 total
Yup! Right by Chisdjfljsdf station!. Chikusa. It's enroute to the Zoo and Mei's house!. There is a polar bear at the Zoo!
Actually Tama Zoological Park or Ueno Zoo are the ones to see (near Tokyo). So we can do something else in Nagoya!
Oh my goodness!!!!!!!. Yes!!!!!
That is the cutest thing ever :')
It's a little tiny ball of hugs!. Thank you!!!
Definitely want to go to this Zoo!!!. We have an official Itinarary by the way
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0_nLZr1-zouf6MH8vLWQwwz103kg23jEkcBvmv1Qwg/edit#
I hope it is going well!. What's left besides Tin Man and magazine?
:D ! Woo. Want to go to the DC Zoo some time, too? :D
I love you too, Peter!!. Ahh, what is the first one?
:3 You're graduating soon! So cool!. Do you already have something like this: http://www.amazon.com/PNY-Elite-Performance-Speed-P-SDH32U195-GE/dp/B00WWBCQCK?ie=UTF8&keywords=sd%20card&qid=1462168357&ref_=sr_1_19&s=pc&sr=1-19 ?
Is it slow between shots?. I'm buying the 32 gb, but I'll trade you during the trip!
I mean, is taking bursts slow?
Does it take awhile to save the picture before you can take another?
I mean, if you wanted to catch an action ahot, you take aburst
5:30pm!
RWAR!
Thanks for the assets. I updated the google doc!
I thought you did too, but I couldn't find it in the drive
That's great!. Isn't it so fancy?. Thanks for putting the title screen up!. Could you make a different black bar for each dialog like how you did it for the title screen last time?
Thank you so so much!!!. The store screen is coming along nicely!! I was going to make your money and inventory count's "flash" when you buy something, that way the player notices!. It greys out things appropriately :D
Oh Yeah :D. With a sad face next to it. I made a "toast" class for displaying things for short amounts of time ;D. Good for messages!
the usual convention!
18 pixels by 16 pixels
Not sure which is which, but it is the standard notation when you preview an image
probably tall vs wide since (x vs y)?
Isn't there a standard convention among graphic designers?. Whoops, that's what I meant
No, I'm just basing this off of the size of the icon
the latter option!
Yup yup :D Thank you!
Thank you!. Does red sound like a good idea?
It looks good :D!!. Could I trouble you for selection bars for restart and resume as well?. Also, could you center Resume/Restart in the middle of the background-sized screen and give the background a black opacity?. Sorry, should have been more clear about this one the specs page!. Also, could it say "Exit to Menu" instead of restart? Or was that too many words?
Thank you!!!!. Looks great!!. Could you make a true to size mock-up of the attribute select module?. up arrow key, box, and down arrow key.  I'm having trouble centering everything. Just one of the 3
Thanks!. I mean the "end level attribute box"
Thank you1!!!. This makes it so much easier :D!!
Thank you :D!
If you have time, could you make the notepad background?. By the way, this is the last night before the expo. So, weimer rotations would be cool, though not required
Oh, It's fine without weimer then :P. Check the graphics google doc for info on notepad. Right now I need just the button that says "Exit to Menu"
Thank you so much!. And I just need "Back to Menu" on it's own to display on the Lose level screen and  the End of Game screen
Itd be cool if the paper-animation-1 had a desk background. or just black packground. maybe a pencil next to it. well, nah. Thank you so much for everything!!!. "Peter for MVP" -Nakkul
Nah, I was just hoping for a black or woodgrain background so it doesn't show up gray. Separate isn. t so good!. And you can forget the "back to menu" stuff until the Internet release later on :P
Oh, I was imagining it on the left side where there is nothing
Oh right!... I'm not using the animation yet, but I will try and get that in
In that case, a wood grain background separate from the paper screen would work. just the same size
Don't worry about this one then
Think conjuring up the wood grain background is a good last help?
Just right now. It doesn't even have to be good wood grain
Thanks! And remember, only the parts poking out from behind the notebook are visible
Thank you!!
This looks really sweet!!. Thank you for all your help!. I will try and locate that sticker you gave me!
It's fantastic!. The wood grain really makes it.
How about a nice french name? Lucille?
We just had the expo and now I am in class!. We won People's Choice Award!!. (:. I'll split the Bodo's gift card with you next time you're in town!
Oh no, still alive?. You may definitely have it. I haven't incorporated Weimer rotations yet though!
I'm glad you're alive! I meant.. "Oh no, I didn't reply..! Are you still alive?"
Oh! There will be bagpipes at your graduation :P
Sweet dreams!!
Hi! What time do you need the jar by?
Cool! As soon as you send the animations, I will implement them!
Right now is fine
You need it by 3
As soon as you can. Are you free right now, or should I just send you the jar without the extra animations?. I would also like the animations to send to my professor :P He said he will do a "Let's Play" video for it
The throwing animations for Weimer, or just rotations will suffice if you are short of time!
Did that answer your question?
Sure!! That would be helpful for me too!. uploaded to Spritesheets folder in google drive
Away from computer
They are on github. Github.com/lli5ba. Okay, I am back in action!
Thank you!!
Did you get the new resources folder?
It works on windows
You just need Java 8 installed
Do you have text files in the resources folder of the player?. I didn't try re-downloading what I uploaded. The case that it would not work is if it is missing resources, since it works fine on my computer
Google drive converted all the files to microsoft word files upon download. I have uploaded it as a zip folder instead!
Just the Weimer animation is good :D. When are your finals done? I think if I have the animations by 10pm, that should give me enough time to incorporate them before midnight
Yay, thank you!
All at once should be fine!. the preprocessing just involves splitting them and naming them correctly
In a spritesheet is fine, but whichever is easier works, as long as they have the correct frame names
tossdown", "tossdownleft", "tossdownright", "tossleft", 			"tossright". For example "tossdown 00, tossdown 01, tossdown 02, tossdown 03"
Thanks! What is a good estimate for completion?
Cool! Just two more to go then :D. (and a mirror)
How long did left/right take?. to get an idea of the rest
Oh cool! . How the outlook now?. Wow, didn't realize how much work went into these!!!
Nice! The other one is a mirror!
Okay!
Thank you!!. Isn't that all of them?. But you said you're not done?
It takes a while to extract them all though (~10 minutes). I would like to just wait for the actual version, unless you think you're done!. I'll just submit my final build without the animations. But I"ll give the one with animations to Weimer!
No time to add!. But I'll do it for the copy I send to Weimer!
Thanks, I'll try to do it now. Where is the new spritesheet? I don't see it. Please help. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's fine, I'll send it separately
Yeah :P I thought I could make it for a second
Nah, you're fine! Thanks a bunch!. :P. hehe "plz help"
:D. Weimer tossdownleft 5 and 6 are too close together!
Thank you!
Yes!. A call?. Sweet dreams (:
Good morning!
I love you too!!
Ahh, my structural integrity can't handle this massive cat attack!
^-^ It's okay!
Wow! A special event? 
Oh great!!! I'm so glad you are finally done!!
Yum!
Great! Saving the student body from pesticides is very commenable.
I love you too!
Good morning!. Check your email. A picture is needed for your ID card!
What are the instructions for attending your graduation? Do I need a ticket?
Am I meeting with you before hand?. What screenshot would you like? I have a few
I mean, am I meeting with you before your graduation in the morning ?
Good night. What is the plan?
Heading home now!
Where should I park?. May I park at your house and walk over with you?
Will parking at your house be okay?
I'll try somewhere on campus first.. What time are you leaving?. When do you need those screenshots by?
I mean, is there a deadline on the screenshots?. I can bring my laptop and we can play tomorrow!
Oh, great!. They can play too
Good night! !. So I am parking at your house, right?
Good morning!!. <3. Are you in Radford already?
Do you know what color you are wearing?
Ohh, I thought you were joking!
But is it your favorite?
I'm heading over in 5, but I can give you a ride to where you need to be at 8:45. And then I'll find parking
I've seen people wear kaki so it doesn't clash with the black gown
Well 8:50. May I use your nice camera to take pictures of you during the ceremony?. Here!
It's pretty nice outside!. Also, it's locked?
Screenshots are uploaded to the google drive!
I'm not going to sleep yet!! ;P. Do you have any school work left?. Oh! What other festivities did you do today?
Oh good!
Or maybe you're the ninja!
Yeah, I have work left!. When you vote in the election, be sure not to vote for independents! :P
It will dilute the vote compared to sticking to the two parties. Aka, it won't count against Trump. Tanul says congratulations!!. This is a good explaination if it doesn't make sense the way I explained it. "First Past the Post In a First Past the Post system, voting third party is a wasted vote. The point of voting for a candidate is to maximize their chance of winning. The chance of a third party candidate winning are astronomical, so by voting for the lesser of two evils, voters are maximizing the chance of electing a candidate that is tolerable.  The First Past the Post system also has what is known as the spoiler effect. Suppose there was an election between the Democrats and the Republicans. The Democrats got 51% of the vote, and Republicans got 49%. The Democrats would win and get elected. Now suppose that a similar election, but the Green Party got a significant portion of the votes. Suppose that the Green Party gets 10% of the votes, and the people who voted Green normally would have voted Democratic. The results are as follows: Republican 49%, Democratic 41%, and Green 10%. The Republicans won with a plurality vote, even though 51% voted for Democratic or Green. Ergo, voting third party is a vote against yourself. ". A bit sad that the system works this way, but unless the independent candidate has a chance of winning, it is debatably a wasted vote.. a high* chance
But better than the worst!. Haha, I like this post too... "If you vote for someone who has no chance of winning, a class in which most third party candidates fall, you're wasting your vote. You will still influence the election by taking votes away from the contender that you would have otherwise voted for, but unless you're just voting to make yourself feel good (voting your conscience) you should vote for the person who could possibly win that you like the most. Think of it as choosing ice cream. You love peanut-butter-rippled pistachio, like vanilla, and are allergic to chocolate. You have to eat what everyone in your state votes for. Do you vote for pistachio and go to the emergency room, or do you vote for vanilla?". And I think I told you what my professor said when asked who he would vote for!
Yeah :P Chocolate would win. The other option is to leave the country?
Or impeachment if you happen to be a delegate. People who live in the USA must abide to the government. Social contracts, Peter
If the chocolate ice cream is President, you will definitely be effected!!. affected*
Can't escape nuclear fall out.. :P
That is scary that people would vot Trump! I would definitely differ on that. What is your dad's thought process behind this? . vote for*
Is Hillary secretly going to be even worse than repealing Obamacare, banning Muslims, and building a wall? (Though only the first would actually happen, hopefully, since it requires senate and HOR support). Perhaps Trump is more trustworthy in that he "will do everything that he says"
:P. Sure, but do which candidate would you rather have when dealing with other nations? And serving as a figurehead for the USa?
Do you think he is lying about doing all the craziness to get more votes?. Seems like a strange strategy
Because Americans are racist.
:P Well, just Trump supporters
 http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/false/
Well he "lies" (or is misinformed)  about the facts, but lying about his platform seems less plausible . "Even if the they knew it was the better option"? Votes are anonymous. Why would they ever vote for someone they think is worse (besides the third party debate). ?
No, if they vote with their party, it will be because they want to. 
Not because they think the other party's candidate is better
Sure, there are always people who do crazy things. The crazy part is... "I think Hillary is better, but I will vote for Trump." That is a logical fallacy. If someone votes for Trump, it's because they think he is the best candidate (out of the two main parties)
Unless they are masochists or something. And I'm saying that if people say that, then they don't actually think Hillary is better, otherwise they would vote for her. Maybe they just want to avoid the death glares for siding with Trump
You could say that any subset of people existed. I am saying that they are the minority
Hopefully, they are!. And of course not all his supporters are racist. Like your Dad. But I think if they know his platform and choose to support him based on his platform (aka they like his ideas about banning muslims, etc), then they are racist . Because intolerance or a sense of supremecy for other races is how racism is defined.
True, but I think if you choose to judge a race based on certain members of that race, this is the definition of racism and stereotyping, and these people should be educated on that.. No one intends to be racist (hopefully). . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism. But what you just described is definitely racism.. And it's dangerous when people don't realize that. Most racism occurs our of fear, not hatred. Or maybe it starts as a fear and turns into a hatred?. Lots of examples of this in history!. Is terrorism a historical occurrence? (Aka, are we repeating the past?) Or is this our first battle against it?. To my knowledge, it has never been resolved in the past. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_terrorism  . Well if the "Reign of Terror" is our historical example, that certainly didn't end well!!. Well I'm off now, just to let you know! 
Have a great Mother's Day! 
We were raised to not be swayed by one source, and always look on the other side. It'd be neat if all could be that way!. Congrats to Paige!
Well it doesn't help calling them racist, but that's how racism starts!. I'm glad she has a job. The real question is.. is it her dream job? 
I watched a Ted talk about how after you graduate, it is okay not be locked into a job, because these are the most important deciding years of our life and nearly the only time when we have the freedom to follow our dreams!
(you can follow your dreams any time, but it is easier when you don't have so many obligations holding you back)
Glad she is living the dream so early in her life!. Does she aspire to become a more reputable hair cutter (like the celebrity ones?)
Hehe, I meant like a "recognized hair stylist"
http://www.payscale.com/career-news/2015/05/how-i-got-my-dream-job-roxie-hunt-hair-stylist-diy-hair-mogul
Whoa, didn't realize that you have to work your way up to coloring!! I hope she shows them how great she is!
Well,  lots of support to Paige these first few weeks :D Soon people will be requesting her! I forget how important conversation is as part of the hair cutting service too!
Thank you!! And you too! Let's collaborate on a packing list. I'll start up a Google Doc and put everything I'm packing. I'm planning to go to Walmart tomorrow for some face sunscreen!
Yes :D!!
That's fine! We can decide which parts of it we need. The car one is a bit bulky
Yeah!. I'm on the Google doc now !
Just put it in your checked bag. Same for large liquids/gels like shaving cream, sunscreen. I'm going to JC Penny tomorrow too if you want to look for sandals!
And packing :d
My mom gave me a non-polarizer adaptor. Do you still need a 3 prong one?. Actually, I'm not sure if this will work :P. But I'm bringing all non-polarized things (I'll double check though)
I have a luggage tag for you!. I also have an airplane kit. It has socks, an eye mask, a travel toothbrush and paste, and earplugs!. Would you like it?. Wow!! It's real!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoauUswqrY. Omg!!. "these people look like they have milk mustaches" :P
Could you send the pictures of us?. At your graduation?
Thank you!
Yes :P. The video is pretty hilarious. I'll ask him to add more "credits"
hehe
Yes please!
No, just as they are is fine! Or you can send both the normal and "fixed" versions if you like
Yes please! (:. Rawr!
RAWR!
hehe, did you watch the video?
It's pretty funny, eh?. Or maybe that's because I made the game.
What do you mean by program? An epub file is used on ereaders/tablets. I don't know how currently. But I may be able to easily with a tutorial.. https://janefriedman.com/word-epub/. Do you mean something like that?
The programming for "page turning" an epub is what you would program into something like kalibri. I think Kindles also have this feature. "Calibre," I meant.. It has the page turning animation!
It's an ereader program. You use it to read "epub" files.
What do you mean by "universal?" You will need a secondary application to make an epub or pdf file look animated.. In the form of a specialized epub or pdf reader
Html is associated with webpages?. What functionality are you trying to implement and in what software?. Also, if you have seen it online, what is the example?. It might make more sense to me..
What would you like the end product to be?
I am misunderstanding something. ePub files are static files, so are pdf files. The interactivity is external to the file and is contained in the program that is reading the file.. So what you are trying to do is create a pdf reader or ePub reader, but these already exist.. Are you trying to create a program?
Or do you want to end product to just be a .pdf or .epub file?
Oh, you're trying to embed flash in a pdf?. I had no idea this was a thing. (http://www.investintech.com/resources/blog/archives/143-6-awesome-examples-of-multimedia-pdfs.html). It must have died out in the 2009s :P. I'm guessing you've seen this already?. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1mWcghD4MY. Looks like it's a built in feature in inDesign. As you said above. It's probably only possible in swf
Thank you!
Are you free to come shopping with me tomorrow?
Did you send the picture to your dad already?
The with with Warner and him. Also, what is Jasmine's last name?. Oh, I found her!
Oh! What time are you up for tomorrow?. Also, did you send your dad the picture, or should I/. ?*
Oh good!
Okay, how does 1pm sound?
Okay
It's up to you!. The best cases are probably online. (for the best price, I mean). I like those "ballistics glass screen protectors". too
Yeah. You could just use a temporary one and be careful.. Or do price comparison with best buy and eBay/amazon and see if it's not too much more expensive at bestbuy. Definitely don't buy it at Verizon unless it's included
Cool
I think so.. It's a monster.. But my phone hasn't broken!. And I sure have dropped it a lot
Can't beat eBay though!
Returns: "14 days money back, buyer pays return shipping". Not bad policy on the off chance of a bad product. Risk $5 to save $30
But if you have the money, people prefer not to be inconvenienced.. And eBay has protections against that.. Has that happened to you recently?
Just be smart in who you buy from. Look for "top seller" badges, good reviews, longer-lived accounts.
Just use caution.. Or don't buy if you don't want to take the risk!. Easy peasy
Are we on a night schedule?. Aw, are you only selectively uploading pictures?. I was hoping to see them all!!!
The graduation pictures!
Oh, I know which ones are missing ;P
All of the later ones, more candid ones, more of you walking, etc. No need to discriminate!
Okay! If you have time, would you be open to doing the rest?
Definitely all of them
Or we can play qqbubble arena!. In the airport maybe. http://download.cnet.com/QQ-Bubble-Arena/3000-2099_4-10920934.html. Oh, maybe there is a Mac version!
So sad, no Mac support!. :P. You'll just have to borrow a Windows laptop
!! Wow!!
I think I might go to BestBuy too!

Oh, and if you need it at all, the running thingys were 3 250meters at 80%, 3 120meters at 80%, and 6 40meters at 80%. Rest time was about 2.5 minutes between each of the first 2, then a 5 minute break, and then alternating 45s and 2.5 minutes rests for the 40m. Oh, and then 3 picnic table hills and 3 easy hills :P . it sounds rather complicated, but it was kind of fun :D . And you could probably cut it down a little. :D you're really cool (:. ooh :D I could even do it with you if you wanted

It's not enough but to make a tiny snowman though :P
:P psh, you had your turn for that :P. just kidding, it would be pretty awesome! :D
:P I'm kidding, it's always snowman-making time. That's like train time
What kind of things? :d. :D*
I am doing fun things, silly (:
like talking to you? :D
:P lol Well those are all fun, especially the essays, but I like what I'm doing right now (:. So, the track meet yesterday was sort of fun :D!! Did anything cool happen during yours? :D
Well I s'pose it was shorter.  It was crazy o.o we left well it was dark and we came back when it was dark. I was wondering how anyone could tell the difference between morning dark and night dark without a clock 
:P lol same here :d!!! :D. Whoa, on the bus ride there I listened to the same song the whole way o.o I played it for almost the first time and I had to keep listening :P I don't know why though
It's called um.. Whimby's Dream World
Aw, that's not the most fun, but at least people were all awake to talk to. Where is Rawr? :P
Aw, there does happen to be a lack of seniors on the track team :P
!! I should've lent you mine :D! If I had had it at school with me..!. o.o. Sound like an adventure! :d. :D*. I want to tell you about the track meet when I see you :D. or y'know, whenever. :D!!. I want to read the Polar Bear and Panda book with you :D!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's so so good :D!!
I had story time at the track meet because someone asked about it, but I really really was wanting to read it with you!! :D. Maybe we still could!
It was that good :DDD. :D!!8. :D!!*
I'd love to :D
!! And I really want you to hear it :D
It'd probably still make me tear up again :P. !! Can we? :D!!!. (:. sorry :P
:P Can I read it to you? :D!!. Sharing is the best part! (:
:P Maybe I shouldn't've asked, because I'm so planning to read it with you anyway. Unless you're compleeeetttely against it . :D
But it was just that good :d~. :P lol whoa. funny smiley. :D!*
Aw, will you be free tomorrow or anytime over break? :D. We could bind that bookI sleeptore too, If you're still offering :D
Ohhh, okay

Yay :D. sorry :P
lol It's nice enough of you just to lend the glue though. So if you have work don't feel obligated :D. You're really cool
That makes for the niceest breaks (:
Ah, maybe it's debatable, but I'm one of those peoples who likes avoiding work :P Unless it's something I'd like to do I suppose. That's why Mr. Lewis was so right with the "Find something you like to do!" thingy :D
Like I said (: I like talking to you :D!. And calling you.. and stuffs... sorry :P stalkerish?. Maybe I should be the one letting you get to things :P
yay (: just celeryish then?. :D!!! Eating is always good :P. Quite especially if you haven't :P

Yeah :P They got a taste of cleanliness :D! . or um.. coldness
oh yeah :P but they seem to come around every week anyway. they must like getting kicked to the curb :P
Oooh :D!!!
aw, just kidding
:P 
I like those 'taking out the trash pun' though. puns
aw :/. I miss you too. :D
but one day.... We'll make Pina Coladas :D
:P
It's alright (:. Aw... but things aren't as fun as talking to you. unless it involves Hugo and you :D
It would :D. It does sound like an interesting movie
Whoa.
:D!!! glue is cool!. but like I said... I may need help :P. o.o 
Is Friday too soon? :D
I wish your wishes could come true :D!. Because I wished too, but not hard enough . I'm sorry I can't always do things :/. I finished all my work though :D. besides the things due on friday and the thing I have to draw on adobe illustrator. You deserve whatever you want :D. You should know that I'm not the coolest person to hang out with though :P. making pottery is fun :D
Maybe you are just some guy, but you mean way more to me than any other guy.  So that 'just some guy' is really amazingness and rainbows and adventure time and everything about you that's amazing. Which is, well... everything! :D
:P nooo, you're the amazingness and rainbows. and you're so so special ;D. :D*
I'm going to prove it to you one day :D. It seems impossible, but I think one day, you'll just know the extent of your amazingness (:
challenge on :D. :P
You wasting my time would be like... a leopard roaming the subway in a bright blue tee shirt while pushing a shopping cart.... yeah :D
ooh, and he's selling balloon animals!. lol :P oh yeah, those tshirtwearingcartpushing leopards are everywhere
but you've never bothered me ever before. you always give me smiles and butterflies everywhere :D
I don't think you are, and I don't quite know what lame is. But if you are lame, then I like lame (: It's my favorite thing ever then :D
:P. I know not what you're sorry for :P . And I know not why that sentence was backwards. Yoda I am not... nor I am Shakesphere?. ahh, is confusing this... orrys :P
bruha. :P
What could someone like yourself have to be sorry?. sorry for*. sorry :P eager question mark..
It's hard to forget something when it's making you not your happiest :/
You don't have to be sorry :D
Are you alright though? :D. 'What trivial trifle troubles you?'
Doesn't matter to who? I may um.. ooh :D--'beg to differ'. Got it that time :P
Everything matters to someone. Even the tiniest little honeybee...um... *insert inspiring story*. :P sorry
I worry much too much to prevent it;  It must be luck that someone like me gets to spend time with the greatest guy ever, but luck only lasts so long... and feelings seem to last forever.. 
Worrying about you.. 
And sorry to get you lost :P We should've used the buddy system :P
I know, I'm afraid it's hard to not worry though :P 
Well hopes don't have to come crashing down.. they can just sort of stay up in the air :D
You don't have to try--I'm already so in love with you :P . sorry :P. um.
:3. Hopes are nice (:
oh, well I wouldn't do that.  :D Hopes make the world go 'round. along with love :D. and um.. orbital/gravitational pull ;P. :P*
Why is that, if you like to tell?
You know how turtles go in their shells sometimes?
!! :D
yeah, how do you tell if there's a turtle in there or not? :P
:D That makes bunches of sense. Like.. where else would the turtle go?
:P lol I think Franklin the turtle does that sometimes. Oh no!! :P You should've gotten that cow for your backyard.. then this would've never happened...
:/ Peter, you're amazing and I could never think less of you.  And when in doubt, just imagine a really cool sheep jumping over a fence :D. Whoa, robotics today?. Do you need a ride? :D!
Important things are like.. chairs :D . and you (;. (:*. Good luck biking
And goodnight and sweet dreams to you too :D But I wouldn't let that happen. Have fun at robotics :D!
o.o Scared? why?
:(. I wish I could give you a ride :(
but be safe and wear lots of layers :D
Stuff? It's vague, but I'll ask you later. :D because I'll see you tomorrow at school (:. Bye and good luck at robotics (;. (: *. sorry
aw :/. I want to take all the sad smileys you ever make and make them happy :D. and make you happy. :/
:P You might be right
maybe it does :D . just as long as that leaves room for lots of future pina colada and game playing happiness :D
If it counts.. I like you (: And that's just one person to name
:3
You'll be okay, just imagine that they're hot potatoes everywhere :D Or just microwave a bunch of potatoes and put them in your pockets :P. It's totally what they did before 'Hot hands"
:D!! yeah
:P And those kids with the thick skin always won.... :P. It's totally how that game started :D. I should let you go so you can be safe :D
and take your time. jinxish! :D. sorry :P. bye!
(: Thanks for talking to me
ahhhh, you better go then, but stay safe. and bring light!
I wish I could make you not scared :/
You're so brilliant, I didn't think a guy like you could be scared of anything. And it's okay :D they're awesome
Don't worry, it'll be fine (:. You'll be fine
Sorry for keeping you so long :D but I'll be here when you get back
And no... Seeing you is the best.. And that wouldn't happen... Just to ease any of your worries :D
o.o. ew. The only guy I would ever think of kissing..
...it's you. :D :P. I wish I watched enough to know that. (it's funny)
honey and mashed potatoes? :D good combo?. because I'm out of gravy..
Actually, I'm not.. I just like honey so much :D
yummm :D. And I don't believe it either..
but it's you, and I dont' think it can change... Honey butter? :D
:P but.. you're the only one... like tigger!. :D sorry, bye :d. :D*. Be super safe
and sorry for saying this.. but feel free to call me if anything happens or if you just get scared or need some batteries or a ride or gloves or anything. anyone..? 
no one in general who what? . sorry.. I'm a tad slow... :D!! you're so so great..
I love you thiisssssssssssss much *stretches arms out as far as they go*
It's you.. 
:P nooo my arm span is bigger :D!

'Ello there :D
aw, it's not that late already, is it?. (:. At first, I read that as.. "I should let you get some soup.." :P
:P Maybe it's too late for soup. But I wish I had some for you about an hour ago.. . Are you okay, by the way? :/
You're the most amazing guy ever to me... :/ Why don't you see it too?
sorry. But.. It's so true! It's like.. as true as that bunny holding his arms out and saying 'I lub you.' because he's a bunny and he can't pronounce the word love...
:P same with the words 'strawberries' and 'gerbil.' I always had trouble with those too though :P. You must have trouble believing your super amazing.. just like that rabbit and pronouncing words. But I don't think his inability to pronounce things has ever made him sad :(. you're*!!***. :P
And I'd always think you're incredibly cute :3. even if you can pronounce thingys :P
You are :D It's true. . I know so for sure (;. because.. when I see you.. I get those little butterfly guys.. and then I get all nervous. But that might also be because you're a super amazing guy and you always say everything right.. 
but.. but... . You just are.  It's just everything about you that makes you.. well, amazing :D!. you're so amazing that there's not even quite the right word for your amazingness :P. Hey, Peter..?
um.. hi :D . Sorry... but um..
May I call you to say goodnight? . sorry. I scared you? :P
'boo! :o
o.o like... You're amazing (:. Are you sure I can call? I feel like I've been doing that too much... sorry. My socks are really fuzzy o:D. Whoa.. smiley with a halo. They're the ones that are soooo fluffy, that they don't fit quite right in my shoes :P. sorry. Well um.. I better let you get to sleep :D School tomorrow will be all normal and un-examy. With an 80% chance of snow according to my own weather channel. :D. I hope your dreams are all turtle-y, and I hope they all have shells on for protection and stuffs :D Goodnight (:. You're really amazing. And don't forget it :3. ttfn and see you tomorrow (: sorry for all these silly messages
Aw :/ you're worth all the waits in the world! And that's like a kajillion tons! I actually thought you didn't want to respond :/ and i was saying all those silly things... I'm sorry.  I'm excited for today because we'll be all at school and it'll be cool!
Ello :D!. Didn't want to look at you? It's about the opposite. . :/ Hey, are you alright/. ?*. they're quite a lot of sad smileys up there... And it's okay about the ride, I was able to get a good part of my first essay done at the rec center :D. You doubted me? :P nah, innovation is hard when you don't know the f irst thing about rocket science :D. first*. And I did want it :P I actually ate it too!. And noooo, never disappointed in you.. that'd be impossible. I was just worried I would offend you somehow with one thing or another.. because I wanted to share poptarts (that were actually yours) with you, but I wasn't sure if you wanted to.. and I'm sorry! I don't want you to feel bad at all :( . You're all I want and I have the most fun ever with you! :D I just wish I could make you happier, but I always seem to mess it up :/. And maybe all my tries just make you think more and more that I might not be right.. but I'll keep trying! :D If it means I get to spend time with you!.. but if it's not for what's best for you, I might concede.. :/ . I should just stop being silly :D. I hope I get to talk to you tonight or sometime, but for now, it's... Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go! :D. thanks for all your support and with the paper too (: it helps a lot. could I call you, do you think? .. . I always end up missing you... :P!! that reminds me of the end of catcher in the rye... I had to look this up.. but it's all like.. "Don't ever tell anyone anything. If you do, you start missing everyone. :P"
ooh hi :D
:D!! but I finished my history thing.. now I just have three more.. :D
Aw :3 You think I'm the right girl? (: Well you're most definitely the right guy for me. Just push all your inhibitions aside and know that you just being you is everything that makes me like you (: You're so fun and you're more amazing than anything I could ever imagine :D. Aw.. okay :D. I'll keep chugging along :P and "hope that hampster in my head doesn't fall asleep"
Whoops :P hamster*
(: 
It's okay, I realize I have them too :/ I'm always so afraid of stuffs but then I think of how it was way back when and how you somehow liked me when I was just an average random girl. :D!!! Whoa, rockets? :D. so cool!
lol :P it's okay, thank you so much to trying to help :D
I gotta be strong and do this :D I'm sure the teacher would be happy with just 'something' after all this time :P
Aw :3 I've always just been average to me though.. And I'm still so worried it's never enough.  You've always been perfect to me :D
I thought you were the magic :P you might just be confused because maybe it rubs off on me when I'm around you :D. aw (:
Well don't worry anymore (: You're perfect. . :D! yeah!. :D We'll be wizzzarrrds :D. minus the beards o.o
lol :P Oh yeah, those always do the trick. :P just kidding though.. I'd still like you the same with or without those :D! . ooh :D And yes :D!! . But make sure you use it for good and not evil o.o
having more than one lumps of hair on your head can be dangerous o.o :P
:P no, you should do what you want regardless of me! :D. Whoa :D Andy Grammer? :D he's all grammatically correct and stuffs
of snow? :D you could make even more because you'd have magic beard powers :P. :D And I'll have to listen to that song sometime, it sounds cool :D
I'll try to be the bestest worker ever and have at least one essay finished by 9, to be optimistic :P
o.o I bet.. Do guys like them? :P
:P that makes perfect sense
o.o do guys really shave?
o.o I'm not sure.. I've never seen a guy shave before :P It sounds funny. !!!. You can pretend you're Santa everytime you put shaving cream on your face :D
ooh :D!!! I like cleaning desks and balloons with shaving cream. What? Girls shave? :P 
o.o I'm not sure either.. I've never seen a girl shaving..
!!! I bet they get to pretend they're Santa too :D!
It's crazy magical :P
yeah.. Except for swimmers..
I'm pretty sure they do! :v
so they're more aerodynamic!
like Rufus!. :D
Yay :D. Hairless and rocking it :D
I believe he did a rap once upon a time... oh it's okay :D! I like talking to you (:
okay.. I'll do my stuffs :D. I'll try my very hardes. t. It's the best :D!!. lol hardees..
okay :D I'll go go go :D!!! gotta go, gotta go, gotta go write stuffs!. (: aw.. byebye amazing guy. Thanks for getting the 'miss' out of me.
bye (: but I don't know what you have to be sorry for, sillyhead :3. ttfn :D
I love you:3!!. Sorry :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too though :D!
:D!!! But you can sing!! :D You're amazing (:. :3. :P sorry. :D Goodnight though :D! I like your everything :D. (: 
You didn't mess up anything :D!
:P I was the one who broke that pop tart... Well if you did, I didn't notice :D
Aw, well that's alright :D!. That sounds really cool though :D!!. All your book stuff sounds awesome!!
Well there's always a way to fix it :D!. And with my untrained eye.. I'd probably say it looks amazing anyway :P
:D!!! It's okay, it'll work out :D!. You could always do another cover? :D 
Well that's okay, it's a learning thing. And money should never be an obstacle :D
I have 5 dollars with your name on it :D. And I'd use that book!. after I make a book so I can read yours :P
okay, I have 20 dollars with your name on it :P. (actually, I don't)..
but it's okay, money doesn't mean anything
Well, even if the situation is horrible, just pick yourself up and don't dwell on misfortunes? :D Counting the losses doesn't do anything except in history textbooks. Or um.. something along those lines :D. Ah, I guess you're right. I always mess up though :P so you get used to it eventually. you can't let it bother you. not that you were
That's good :D
nooo... that you're not bothered by it, and it could be good that you say it's your fault.. because that's always a good thing to accept.. I think you're just not allowed to let that mess you up either :D You just gotta keepppp moving on.. like that um.. Avril Lavigne song (where did she go anyways?). And writer's block always goes away eventually :D. And you do so many things right, that you should get a 'sick day' for all your mistakes
I'm sorry :/ I'm slow a lot of the time..
but it is good, right?. well.. not good in itself.. but good nothing worse happened?
You could have died!!! o.o. yeah.
o.o That's even worse!!. :P. lol sorry
ah.. I mean... ahh I should stop saying stuff :P
I'm so sorry. Okay. :D That's all I'll say. I'll stop messing up too :D. but good night and sweet drams (:
dreams... hmm. :D
I didn't quite have anything else to say... Just whatever comes to mind :D!
kind of like.. improv?
Whoa o.o
If you think about it... the whole world is improv
Well those Office Max guys are always very helpful :D
Actually, I go to Staples more often :D
I like the word hunky-dory... I never hear it all that much :/ 
it reminds me of Finding Nemo..
but Dory isn't quite so hunky... Is hunky even a word?
Hey, you didn't do anything wrong :D
And I never know what to say.. Maybe that's why I say 'sorry' so much :/. just in case I say something wrong..
ironic that that's what I should've said, but didn't :/
ooh :D Sherlock Holmes 2 had an actor who was also in another thingy!. He was in The Borrowers, which was a British movie about short people :D!
Well.. maybe not short.. just super duper tiny

And you're not an awful pwerson, not at all :D

I should've stopped at 'hello' :P
Don't be sorry for what I did :P
just be happy :D. before I made you unhappy
so um.. where were we 30 minutes ago..? Sweet dreams I think it was? :D. sorry :/. And you didn't do anything wrong.

:3 No need to be sorry for anything :D Goodnight, and see you tomorrow!. You are everything that I adore.. (: 
Hello :D!. it's hard to believe.. that I couldn't see.. that you were always right beside me. Thought I was.. :P sorry.. High School Musical Flashback. Aw, could your dad not take you? :/
I got close enough to university mall :P And then my mom wouldn't let me walk home. I should've offered you a ride though :D. Walking isn't too much fun alone
Did you see the pond though? :D!. o.o whoa, when? !!
I smell popcorn :D
It's not mine.
:/ Why do you feel alone?. Do you need a friend? :D
I'm not so great, but I could at least stay :D
(:
:/ 
!! raining? :( Are you alright?. Why do you feel that way? :/ 
I'm sorry :/
I thought something might've been wrong when you were all quiet at practice :/ 
You do matter. You matter so much to me :/ I can't believe I couldn't tell.. . :/ I know you probably don't want me asking this.. but can I help at all?
Peter?
:/ Do you know I've been trying to cheer you up all day? :( I'm terrible at it if I managed to make it even worse :/. I want to ask how I could have helped, but I know I should already know :/. Do you think I could call you?. The internet wasn't made for some things..
Hot chocolate :D!!. :/
And I (think I) know you wouldn't want to hear this either... And I'd rather not say it through here.. but.. I love you.  And there's not a time when that's not running through my head when I see you.
Okay, but stay safe okay? And if you need someone to talk to, I'll be on Facebook. Or by the phone.. you know :P. :3. fly snails. tie snails
:/ I thought I was doing everything right.. Well, I never do anything right. But.. ah, :/ . Are you sure I can't call you?
A girlfriend should always make you happy :/ I'm not doing a very good job..
:D!! It's Friday!
Okay. Are you absolutely positive I can't call though?
It might be a waste of time considering what I'd have to say.. but... okay :/. I'm sorry Peter..
You'd still want to see me? 
I thought everything was just all crumbling down. :(. It's like I'm Nero, and everything is just burning down around me, with no one but me as the cause.. :v. And that's pac man. Who enjoys eating circles and running away from colorful ghosties. (:
.... :P are you sure about that?. Sometimes I just feel like I can't do it right :/
What happened Tuesday night? . And it wouldn't be your fault at all, 'on account of' I don't think you did anything at all wrong, and I definitely don't feel like you did anything wrong
awww... That?. It was just super cold and slightly rainy, and I wouldn't have wanted you to bike home in that more than you had to. And you were nice enough to spend time with me that day (:. And play that extra round of that gun game :P. That made my day :P
sorry for hitting you with my gun a bunch though :P
We have to play that again sometime!! :D. Don't worry about me not wanting you, because truth be told it could never happen. 
You're the only guy... sorry
I feel like anything I could say about it sound so cheesy.. . but maybe it is cheesy... how much you make me smile inside and out and how much I'd like to spend time with you doing just silly stuff
Cheesy things are some of the best (: Says that rainbow card of yours :P. I'm bad at being busy... I'm busy, but I work too slow :(
I'll just be quicker :D
or better.. or smarter :/. If I think too much though, I'll end up like that bear :P
sans sandwich. Geniuses aren't very smart then
:P That's crazy talk.. You're the smartest guy I know. . And not just books smarts
You're like.. smart.. but not a nerd... even though nerds are cool and tasty too :P
And you're super athletic, but you're not a jock. And you the nicest guy ever (:. you're*
You're all the good stuff in the world wrapped up in a guy named Peter. (:. with an amazing personality. Who always makes me happy. :D 
Are you sure I can't call you?
I'd want to call even if you were feeling as happy as ever.. . And I'll get to work, I pinky promised :D
awww :( I wish I could warm you up... sorry. or give you hot chocolate or something
And I'm not so great to do something with
You're the most fun ever though :D
Work? What is this work thing? :P. Sorry... I will. as harder than I've never worked before!! :D
:P. Thanks. That's a good reason though. but you could be doing more funerer stuffs!. it's a good reason for me :P
:( warm showers?. You're amazing. I need to be a better friend :/. I want so much to make you as happy as ever :/. Yet I feel like I always end up messing up, or not knowing what to do. I feel like you've told me before.. is it that I somehow forgot? :/
You're the only guy I want as anything more than a friend. And I'm not such a good bestest friend :/. I'll keep trying though!
for as many times as you'll let me try. :/ Ah, don't be disappointed.. it's just me :P
but I should let you know that I won't be able to do anything this weekend :/
but maybe you could join the "New Year" festivities on Sunday
Exactly.. it's just me :P that's nothing to be disappointed about... I'm sorry though :/ If it did disappoint you
It's because I haven't been managing my time properly :/. You can't say something like that :P. not just because of me
Don't let me mess up alllll your hopes forever :(. That sounds like everything I'd like to tell you (:. but it doesn't make sense when you're the one telling me..
noo, don't be alone :P
They're plenty of perfectly cool people in this world. And those unfortunately, not quite include me :P. aw :( sad face?. Are you alright?
Can I call?
reverse psychology? Is that actually telling me to call you? :P
Noo, that's a silly assumption :P I'm the only one to blame for my irresponsibility.
And there's no reason that you can't do fun stuff this weekend (:
Without homework to weigh you down, you can do whatever your heart desires :D. :/. sorry
ah, I"m sorry Peter :/ I wish I could talk to you in person sometime. Summer weather is normally nice for that (:. :P And I'm sorry for whatever you may or may not find on your phone
I wish summer could have happened today too :D. :/ And there's no need to feel bad. Unless it was caused by me :P :/ ah.. I'm sorry. I want you to have a nice weekend though :D Do the fun stuff you did before I sort of kind of messed up your life :/ Sorry.. . but you're really cool, you'd have no problem finding fun stuff :D. And I'll get to all that crazy works that I have :P. You're really cool :3 And I like you (:. Sweet dreams just in case I don't get to say it later :D
'ello!
There's always cool things to be done..
And it's debatable :/ ah, sorry I said that though
I saw you today :D!!
You were wearing a cool jacket and you were really cool and a good drawer of bothers :D. !!! There's cool square dancing at the YMCA tomorrow night :P
me either :P apparently you don't need a partner in square dancing though because you switch so much. I don't think I'd go without you though :3
:P I was thinking about it , I'm not sure though. I should just go do homework for now :P
I would ask you if I were to go though :D! I can't go without a partner :P
oh I don't either :P I think you can learn beforehand though, somehow
Yeah :P I've never been square-dancing before. I know, 'first things first' I suppose :P
Me either o.o How do people even find out about squredancing festivities?. lol we can go cookie decorating at the rec!. yeah!
I think so :P Or at least, they did in the winter
Definitely, but pretty cool! :D
It's okay (: You're never ever a bother. I'll get to work though :D!. Thank you for everything and I'm so so sorry :/. but definitely don't wait up for me to do something :D there's lots of cool stuffs out there. ah, not that you'd wait up for me, there's plenty of better things to be doing :D
square dancing :P
!!!! cutting pineapple party :P. lol you bring yours.. and we both cut them together :P
I've only cut one before :D so it'd be a mutual cluelessness
:P nah, I won't go pro until after reaching 'ninja' status. And then I'll be.. pro ninja! :D. but the road is tough o.o With many spiky fruit along the path to ninjahood.
!!! :D!. That sounds supercool!. Is it really spiky? :P And does it breathe fire as the name implies?
!! :D I never knew that before.. But then again, I don't have much experience with 'fruit of the dragon variety' :P
!!! You should totally have the real thing sometime :P
I'll import you one sometime :P. all the way from Austrailia!
You don't have to ask :D one day, you'll just see one at your door.. And you'll wonder what it is :P
Who knows how long it's had to travel by then. :P
maybe not, but I'll find a way! :P. Dragon fruit trees... hmm
oh um.. dragon fruit cactus ;D. :D*. Even better, it doesn't need too much water? :P
It'd be quite an interesting story if you have :P. I imagine it'd.. grow wings or something :D
You're not wasting my time (: Not at all
Good point, but you still wouldn't be a waste of time. I'll go do that :P Like I probably should be.. It'll be fun though :D
If I can stay focused. And thanks (: You too. Especially if it involves Dragon fruit :P. Goodnight Peter (:. You're amazing :D And really really nice (:

sorry for picking you up when you may not have wanted me too :/ I thought you were just being nice about it.. And you are perfect :D (:
You're the one who deserves so much more.. I'd jump at the chance to give you a ride because anything I can do can never compare to all the nice things you do... And my mom wanted to come along :D She was excited to see you and hear about robotics stuff
You do everything and more for me... You're so so nice. (:
You're amazing (:
And in an off topic thing.. here is that song :P . You never ever mess up (:. I don't mean to brag... but uh, If anyone's doing the messing up around here... :P
You haven't wasted any of my time. aw... (: . You make me super lucky already.. And I think pennies are lucky no matter what side you look at them from.
:P That's a cool year.
but that'd be like saying if a leprechaun lies on his tummy, he's not as lucky as he was on his back :P
You're not terrible at anything, by the way (:
I guess the same goes for horseshoes... Bye to you too (: And I wish you the luckiest kind of luck, not the kind that pennies decide
Well pennies are lucky too :D but I think they're unlucky side should be just as lucky as anything (:. :P

You're amazing (:. sorry

You are important. :/ . and amazing (:. bye for now (:
(sorry for saying it twice :P)
You're not awful at all.. you're amazing (:
sorry for calling and everything.. I just wish I could convince you somehow :/. The only reason you wouldn't deserve me is because you're quite out of my league.. (your jersey is the better one :P)
:/ . well you can be in my league then... maybe we'd make a good pair?
you're so so amazing (:

(: do you hear the kitchen calling? :D I'll let you answer it :P
I was just trying to let you go have a duncheon.. because I remembered you said it awhile ago.. and I guess it's silly to think that you weren't going just because of me, but.. and.. just.. sorry.. You're really really cool (:
byebye butterfly. (:
You don't have to be sorry for anything. (: You're all amazingness and sparkles and stuffs.. And it's sort of like you say.. you don't have to be sorry for amazingness... I really like you. :3
aw (: . And okay. I've been reading, so maybe that's a good start. :D. I have to design a spacewalk tool... not to be confused with Michael Jackson, who is in fact, a 'moonwalker'
sorry
:P poking you is fun.
And I guess I just feel like.. if you respond.. it means you don't mind wasting that one second just to poke back :P sorry... silly. I love you so so so much. (:
You never mess anything up, and why would anyone want to deserve me. :P I'd be more on the bad side of the spectrum.. over by expired milk and um.. homework? :p. sorry. I like to do it too (:. And okay. :3 yum, pie. You're not terrible at all. (:. And I don't think you've ever done anything you shouldn't
I'd say I'd be more at fault for anything having to do with those :/. You didn't do anything wrong--you're amazing :D!
and I'm already yours, so you don't have to worry about that (:. I wish the same thing :/
it's okay :D your company is the best. Better even than Oliver's company :P. Thanks for the good luck :D
See you later alligator :D. he's a little orange cat (;. (:*
:P Well alligators are the nicest animals ever then (:
and they smell nice too (:. lol :P. And now.. whenever you come around..
Hook starts freaking out o.o
nah, I think at this point, you're too crafty for him.. you've proven to be too*
byebye (: And sweet dreams to you too. :D Well you're the bestest not-waste-of-time-and-lamo ever (:. You make 'lame' a good thing, if you're lame :D. Bye Peter. (;. (: *. You're awesome!
wish :D. And good morning Peter. (:. I hope you have fun with everything today :D. And thanks for the nice football wishes :P
!! Hi :D!. What's your wish? (:. And how are you?. And you're really cool! (:. And sorry for being late on the response. and for using 'and' so mush
much*
You're not a bother (:. never ever
psh, like doughnuts?. :P. Those get old after a while. :P. :D
Not the ones with words on them o.o. :D
Maybe birthday doughnuts aren't so bad.. those would have words on them sometimes :D. And I'd pick you over doughnuts anyday (:
:/ Unfortunately I do.. hmm.. strange, it's not what I asked for.  I'll have to contact customer service again..
Close :D!. More like.. a guy to eat tacos with (:. And walk to tacos with (:
aw, well that's okay, I already have someone in mind :D. ah, hold on really fast, my washing machine is making these weird beeping noises... It's like it's trying to tell me something.. :P
:D. ello
How has your day been, Peter? (:
Days like that are nice sometimes. (: I tidied up upstairs and did some laundry and got some homework done, but not as many doughnuts as I should.. I think I need to work on my creativeness :P
:D!!. Especially the pink kind with rainbow sprinkles? (:. or at least until you fall into a doughnut coma
Awesome :D!. (:. maybe they've only been talked of in legend.. but then again, so have unicorns :D
!! lol I was thinking of that!. unicorns and doughnuts just go together I suppose (:
(: Ooh!! Glitter does too! Mostly. And you too (:. So, unicorns, doughnuts, you, and glitter all go together pretty well :D
lol :P hmm. You may have a point there. But.. I think you're magic (:. Though it's been said before..
That you're magical :D. "Merry Christmas" could fit too, though :D
Okay :D. but if I were to watch those football commercials, I'd want you to be with me :D. sorry
Psh, in the way how? :D You're cool and stuffs (:
I'd say otherwise (:
You're silly too, so by transitive property... :P you must think you're cool too :D
psh, just because tacos aren't around to confirm it, it could totally still apply :D
Silly people know what they're talking about sometimes :P
I don't know if anything could be better than talking to you... being with you is pretty fun too though :D
ah, well I guess I do have some of those
okay :D. The days never seem quite long enough..
for everything
I think I need to make a plan :P
I'll go work super fast again :D. hmm.. first things first.. How do I improve space walking?. I think.. I'll make a list of problems.. and then see which ones I can fix somehow... sorry, rambling ish
It's okay, You're always lots of help. (: I better figure out how to work well alone though. I'm not the bestest at it yet.. Thank you for all the encouragement always. (:
aw :3. But you're so nice already.. and everything you say is always so nice... I bet you have some stuff you have to get done too though. 
and.. I wish I could do more nice things for you.  It's silly.. but guys get to be all chivalrous.. and I don't know if they're quite as many opportunities for girls to do nice things.  But I'll find them wherever they are :D 
:P aw.. but what nice thing is that for you?
I like your help.. (:
It's the bestest.. (: I'll try to get as much done as I can though.. hmm... inventions/ improvements for astronauts... :P. I'll think of something
:P Oh totally.. Surprising, they have some good options up there :D
!!! yes way :D. They have garlic and tea and juice and salt and pepper and bunches of condiments and chicken and pizza and stuff. I think :P
Oh, but of course! :D. I've never had that stuffs before o.o
:D!!! That's so cool. If it doesn't have onions or mustard in it.. I'm pretty sure I'd be okay with it :D
Want to test that maybe? :P
lol sorry
aw, no? :D well maybe one day when we have some astronaut ice  cream around... You're lots of help by the way (:
You're amazzzing (:
what if I add an extra 'zing' to that?
lol :P zing.. but you being amazing is no joke. :D
It's not a joke, but thinking of you does make me smile (:
ah, I wasn't planning on it.. maybe next year :D
aw, is it?. Well I could catch a few of them maybe :D. They're just commercials :D
Maybe we should make it a tradition, yeah? :P. sorry :P
We'll get to watch the superbowl one day :D. And when we do.. I'll have popcorn ready!
I love seeing you. :/ . It's like.. magic on a stick :D. but better, because.. it's not just on stick..
Thanks for the good luck. And you can stay 'in the way' as much as you want... It's nice. (:
You're great and amazing to boot (:
You are to me and anyone who's had a chance to say hi properly..
Thank you again for the good luck.. (:. Have a really nice day, Peter. :D
You won't?. not even if I send my baby polar bear over? :D

Ah, well if I had one, I'd let you bottle feed him :D
sorry :P 
I don't think you've done anything to be sorry for. But I'd forgive you :3
I was thinking of that, but I don't think you'd ever intentionally do that. :P. unless it was like those video game poppies o.o those are scary.. puppies* :P
ahh, it's so cute :D. but like I said, I don't think you'd intentionally do that o.o
ahh, where do you keep getting all these cute puppy pictures (:. lol :P nice pun. I think there's a band by that name. Do you think you'd want a puppy when you're older? :D
:D
I think so. :3 Especially since I've never had one before.. hmm..
They're so cute :D. I'm thinking about puppies :D. And futures and stufss. stuffs*
:D!!! Yes. I see a puppy in my future.
lol :P I think you're quite cute. (: But comparing me to the cuteness of a puppy is crazy :P
:P!!!~ That statement is even more outrageous :D
or a statement invented by gypsies . to lure little children out and such. :D. :P or um... something.
and you're amazing (:
You're soo amazing (:
You are :D ah, I better go eat dinner, and then work on homework and such
(: Superbowl parties sound fun. But being home alone isn't quite so fun
you could always... explore the basement? :D!. (:
I'll go :D!
Well I'll go one day :P I already dared myself 
I accept your dare :D reluctantly though.
poof?
*disappears in a puff of explosives*. bye for now (: . ahh, the puppies are so cute :P
lol me too :D It's all cutely moving too. And I feel the same. It could be a nice little 'pound puppy'. lol :P I had those when I was little
:D!!. I didn't know they had a show
That's kind of awesome :D. We should totally watch it sometime :p
okay, but doughnuts aren't so fun :P. sometimes. :D bye bye for now . ...would you still like to have the "honor" of being my sillyhead?
Really?!!!! (:. !!!

yeah :D!. And take it on walks
You're absolutely perfect, Peter. (:. lol I bet puppies are more ticklish

Piglet says goodnight too, I think :D
(I kind of like trying to evade your tickles...) (:

and smile and stuffs :D
byebye amazing guy (:
You always make me smile, even when you're not tickling me :P
awww, more cute puppies (:
That's... preposterous. :D. Final words:  You're cute. (: . sillyhead (:
ah, I can't quite limit my final words to that. I really also want you to know that I find you amazing in every way. (: And thank you make me dough dough happy. And I'd jump around for hours knowing you're my sillyhead. :D You make everything feel like fun. (:. Sweet caramel dreams for later. (:. Bye. :3
!!!!! I've totally never heard of that one ever! :D. (: Another movie to watch hopefully?. It looks scary :P (ghosties). See you tomorrow :D. I was just checking what color to wear tomorrow
:D yay for green :D. (:. tomorrow is yelloW!. yellow* :P

:P I just logged in a second ago :D. nice timing, right?
I'm gonna be all speedy and do bunches and bunches of homework hopefully :D. ooh, how are you? (:
oh yeah, I keep my watch nicely wound.
You're not a waste of time at all. (:. but, how are you?
I'm alright too :D. Are you getting stuffs done?. :P. I liked seeing you today (:
and having you be my driving buddy (:. ooh :D
what are the criteria?. that sounds so cool!
Anything you'd make would be awesome (:. well hmm.. How many seconds is it, and what is the medium?
even.. like.. 2 seconds? :P
I would feel too unlimited without criteria :P. hmm.. there's little animations to music.. and then like.. pixar style short stories?
I like this one :D. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOfy5LDpEHo. It may look familiar :P
sure you could :D. it doesn't have to be quite as long :P I bet animation takes forever. It could be like.. a little pusheen gif :P
similar to the link I gave?. or more/less advanced? o.o. This sounds really really awesome!
hmm.. well you're good at drawing just about everything. you could even do like.. a winnie the pooh short based off your book or something :D. Or something with those comic ideas and cats :D. or even dr. seuss style. I guess you just need a starting point?. (:
You probably just have sooo many ideas, that you need to narrow it down? :D
there's soo much stuffs though :D. (:. it's sooo exciting. animation :D!!
I think you're awesome at anything you try (:. hmm.. what do you want your animation to be like? 
lol :P. like.. funny, or cute, or thought-provoking?
:D!!! perfect answer. okay.. step one.. Subject matter :D As in, main character(s). Robot, cats, other animals, people?. etc.
:D okay.. step two, you probably see this coming.. What are they doing?. I guess like.. interacting with people/ the environment, or playing with a toy, or anything else :D. lol for some reason I keep imagining an animation of a person trying to imitate a robot, though it's been done before. or a robot operating an elevator.. hm.  Or a cat trying to jump for something :D. lol I'll save it for when I make an animation one day.... :P
:D aw, my opinions aren't always so great htough. though*. But I always like seeing your stuff (:
I love you too (:. dance steps? :D
yay :D. I think I like the lindyhop.. sorry :P just kidding. I don't even know quite what that looks like. But something's telling me I like it.
me? <("). or are you talking to yourself? (:
ahh, I gotta let you get to robotics, okay? (:. but aw :3
aw okay, I do like talking to you bunches though. (:  I really hope your animation goes well. (: thanks for letting me give you silly suggestions :P
Only on Wednesdays :P
lol well Wednesdays are opposite days :D. not all the time though, maybe just conveniently when you complement me (:
aw :3. You're really really really really amazing and nice and you're a really good walking to class buddy :3
:P lol no, I was being squidward.. Whoa, maybe, It is Tuesday!!! :D
That's impossible :P. Ah, sorry, I kind of do have to go now. :D Tomorrow is giant green truck day :D. (:
Bye for now and have bunches of fun at robotics :D. And with your animation. :D!! That too (:
it's okay (:. byebye amazing guy (:

and another soda goes to Peter Mattox of Blacksburg!
making that his third win of the day :D
:P. I don't know..
there are some people out there who might have to pick soda over me :P. but I'm not sure how I feel about soda. I don't cause as many heart attacks :D. :P And that's a silly thing to say.. You're perfect. (:. but bye for now (:. ttfn :D!
aw :/ typo?. (: *. :D better?
?. :D! robotics'll be lots of fun I hope (:. byebye (:
!!!. I just found you ice!. And I'm sorry I forgot to give it to you! :D. but I have it :P. your ice*. And I kind of want to bring it over :P
I wasn't sure if you had any at home or not.. but I normally use frozen veggies :D Those work well sometimes. And hugs from you are nice 9:. (:*
And I like holding your hand and talking to you
(: You're amazing and I'm sorry you had to wait outside for so long while I was looking for non-existent bandages that you could've used..
I hope so. I didn't notice them doing anything when I wore the bandages, if it's any consolation, but maybe it's be a good measure to take anyway :D
It could be important to make sure your ankle heals properly (:. Yours could be even worse than mine o.o And probably is
I think it does (:
ah, no frozen veggies either?. !!. (:. How about hmm... meat? :P
yeah, I don't think I could put something that was once on something else on my ankle o.o. lol sorry, vague :P. Frozen turkey isn't so bad though
:D (: You too.
Thank you so much for everything, and just for putting up with me :/
because I never quite know what to say when you're feeling not as happy as you could and I want to tell you how much I like you and how much I think of you and all that, but it all just sounds cliche :/ and I just want to talk with you and laugh and have fun and stuff, but I'm not so good at it when I keep making you sad... and did you hear... you're really cool! (:
I can't tell sometimes what you're thinking, or maybe, most of the time. But I always care, and that never changes.. And you are cool (:
I don't think you're capable of doing anything wrong. :D You're the most amazing guy ever.. And I kinda sorta do like you bunches. (:
Hey, it's my opinion, so there's no changing that. :D But I'm quite sure it's true, too. :D and aw, yay :D
noo it's not true :P you're amazing (:. And if not, than I like your 'lameness' (:
No sorries for being not-lame (: maybe just for saying that you are? :P
You are all of that though (:. And more too :D. (:
It sounds like a silly wish though :P. And what is there to be nervous about? :3
Even though you make me nervous too..
Just saying the right things and knowing what to do--I'm still not the bestest at it. And you're so so nice and amazing :D
!!! :D You're so great!
And dont't you forget it :P. don't*. You're the absolute bestest :d. :D*. Ah, sorry, this is bad timing, but I have'ta go eat dinner my mom made
(: Thank you, I'll have as much fun as I can with some shrimp and salad :D. :P. (:
I love you, too, Peter. :D You're absolutely brilliant. :P Do you have any favorite foods? or just everrrything?
allergic? o.o. it's not random at all :D especially if you really are (:
It's okay (: hmm, what are you allergic to?. And goodnight just in case, too :D
Whoa, really? :P
lol remind me not to feed you shrimp..
yum :D. Whoa, I may have heard this before.. :D!!!
Okay, so I think I have an abnormal like for imitation crab.. :P
:D. (:. :3. It's cute. Though I'd argue with every point on there, it's all really really nice :D
You're like.. better than bologna snowflakes :D . lol :P I enjoy the former.
:D both is nice. but I'm still skeptical about the trueness :P. (:. yay, food :D. byebye amazing guy. you have fun too :D
Tell your ankle not to work to hard, okay? :P. (:. I love you so so so so much too (:. :D byebye
ahh :D! it's snowing like crazy! :D (: let's go play in the cold :P. the meet? o.o
oh cool :D
something? :D what kind of something?
And I'm not sure, all I remember is something about iHop :P
I think that's just where people were invited to go afterwards :P or cookout or something. I assumed regionals was all far away though, wayy over the rainbow. :D
oh cool :D!. I know that place :P
:D!!! aw, but walking in the cold? I could give you a ride? :D
I mean, I don't know the logistics of it yet, but I'd like to :D
lol the snow just woke me up. :D. hmm.. is it an.. inflatable sled? :D
it'll happen :D give it time :P. I'm gonna go eat breakfast I think :D
Ooh, and brush my teeth :D (: . that's always fun
Bye :D !! You too, the meet sounds like fun. I'll ask my mom about it and the email from coach. lol couch*
yeah, he told me to stop sitting on him :P
:/ aw, is that just a joke? :P because now I feel all bad for not taking you...
okay :D
I like jokes :P
aw.. hmm.. well if everyone's going than I know lots of people who are headed your way :D
:D okay, good :P
i was worried at first :3
You're so important :D. but right now I feel like you're expecting me to take you :/ or trying to make me feel bad for not :/ ... I just can't always be there, but I know bunches of people who'd be happy to, since your'e so on the way too :d. :D*. wait, I gotta rephrse that
I don't think you'd ever try to make me feel bad, I just do, out of guilt..
wait, wait :D!!. you shouldn't feel bad at all, I just wanted to be Frank with you :P
even though I'm not Frank :P
and it was probably selfish of me, since I just wanted to not feel as bad for not being over there to help
but I should, because it seems important... and I dunno
!! :D It'll be snowing, and that's fun to be in, since we haven't had any in awhile!!
:/ ah, I don't really feel like I deserve any presents right about now
And you're not an awful person :D never ever
ah, sorry, good luck, and sorry for keeping you. :D!! idea?. That sounds like an adventure
hey, I'm sorry  Peter :/. jinx? :D
sorry :P bad jinx?
I know, I'm sorry :/ I feel bad for ever saying that, because you'd never do something mean like that... And I was just calling your phone :D
You're nice, and you never do anything wrong. :D. (:. You're perfect. :3
I could call your phone again, so I could help you find it?
:D didja find it?. or is it on silent, or vibrate, or?
yay :D
ah, sorry :/. ooh :D!!. the snow looks like it's sticking (:. I'm really excited!
sledding could so happen :D
oh yeah, sorry :D I better let you go. Stay warm as you can and enjoy all the snow (:
I'm so sorry for everything :/. Burning bridges, making wishes..

aw, not till monday?
what if, it does snow enough to go sledding? :D
I keep worrying though, because I know me saying all this stuff just changes everything :/. but it doesn't have to?
ah, that's the thing about words... and snow is a special occasion :D. online courses are much too dangerous to take in the snow :D
I don't know :/ I know life doesn't work like that.. but maybe somehow all that silly stuff I said won't matter, and we can just be all cool again. But I'm not quite sure that's how it works.
doubt we'll get snow? :D. it's right here already :D. And ready to be sledded on soon :D. are you up for it? :P. sorry..

exactly :D you could like end world hunger with those big zippers!
:D wishful thinking is nice :D. (:
being with you is nicer (:. sledding with you is fun too :D. I just hope it looks nice enough to use :P
But I wouldn't be offended if she wanted to hang it up and use as wall art either :P. Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too sillyhead (:
(: I'm glad, otherwise I would feel bad that you had to be my sillyhead.  But since we both like it.... Maybe it should stay like that for a while (:
(: I don't know if I'll be able to stop smiling :P. :D! you have fun too (:
lol :P snow dough would make some yummy cookies

aw :3 I love you so so so much too. My Saturday was very nice :D (: !  And sundays are cool too, y'know. :P  I hope your day has been all nice with popcorn and Popsicles and drawing pictures and all the other fun things that make up weekends. :D!  . lol, I guess I'm too late to say the first too, but I can still say goodnight I think :D
(: aw.. You're amazing. :D!  hmm, well maybe the stuff you did falls under the 'all the other fun things' category? :D!
aw :D it's not silly. I wouldn't put that under the 'all the other fun things' category either :P
So, I think I have a special skill at burning popcorn. :P
:D!! Thinking of you is always really fun. (:. lol :P aw, maybe I should've tried it before I threw it out. . :D lol burnt popcorn is the best!!
I know..it was terrible of me :P Some burnt popcorn lovers out there could've thoroughly enjoyed it! 
!!! I can always do a repeat :P Since I'm sooo good at making popcorn and all
Awesome :D! (:. aw :3 me? but, I didn't even say anything. :P There's nothing special here. . The cuteness is like.. right where you are :D (:. It's you.
aw (: !!!. :3 I love you too.. And I think the burnt popcorn is ready right about now :p. Just kidding, it's not a burnt this time. unfortunately :P. as*
Awesome!!! :D Shall I pop in a movie to go with it?. lol :P 'pop'
Naturally. :P Well, almost :D!
Oh, I was kidding about the movie. :P It's just popcorn. But I was thinking of the whole popcorn + movie combo, and I just got a little carried away. :P No movies over here though, I'm not quite sure what I'd watch without a certain friend of mine who has just about every DVD imaginable
That's just what I was thinking! :D
:D! (: Everyone knows that teachers give extra points for food stains. Especially those with that added movie-theater smell :D
(: !!!! Those are both excellent ideas :D
I could be like in some secret agent plot where I'm trying to save the world by solving a mystery about where all the math went in the world :D. aw, alrighty, but just so there's hope for the future (like Obama :D or canned bread!)  (: Goodnight and sweet dreams to you too. (:
(: You're more similar to that certain friend than you'd think :D I can't wait to see you tomorrow either!!! (: It's always something to look forward too (:. I love you so so so much too :3. (There should be a sushi cat smiley!! :P) ttfn silly head (:

(: You're so so so so amazing (:. :D. And I hope your day today is really amazing too (:. I was eating a poptart earlier, and it made me think of you :D. :P
:D~!! Even if it was brown sugar one?
And you must be even more cool and sweet than a poptart :D!. But I wouldn't dream of sticking you in  toaster :P
yes :D! especially then
maybe the popping out part :D!!
trampolines are nice for that though :D. !!
This is true :P maybe we can just turn off the heat. low setting :D

:D! bye for now :D
I'm sleep-facebooking :P. hi (:
(: but you're never a bother. And I like you (:. !!!!. it's stilllllllllll snowing :D
I hope it never ever ever stops :D but then it stops so people don't get to col. d. (: you're so so so so cute :3. sleeping is nice, but not as nice as being with you in the snow and stuffs :D
I have horchata stuck in my head :P. And the bowl I put out for snow cream disappeared.. :P
It's kind of cool :D. lol that It's hidden under the snow, I think. I can faintly see the edges :D
I hope we can have snow adventures sometime too :D. like sleeping?. :D!!! Sooo snowy. I could knock out all my homework maybe :D. !!!!!
oooh, I've been working on it (:. I feel productive. I learned all about reconstruction and all that :D
(: And I'll let you get to stuff too. You're so so amazing (:. !! (:. rawr (:. sorry. :3. !!I really really liked seeing you yesterday
It was the bestest. And ice cream (: yummm :3
Thank you (: you too :D. byebye for now :D
(: you're forgiven for anything that you didn't do :D. (: ttfn sillyhead (:
You're snow snow amazing :P
!!! (:. rawr!. guess what, guess what!! :d. :D*
No school today! :D. What are you gonna do with all your time?
aw :( . nothing at all? :D!
you gotta dooo somethinggg! :D
First, I'm gonna write an essay, and then I'm gonna write two more application ones, and then I'm gonna hope my mom lets me go sledding :D
it's okay, planning is silly anyways :D 
Well not completely, but you don't need a plan to have fun :D. I wish you could help out too! :D. but you don't have'ta do that
Yeah :D. ah, I'm gonna go write :D . brb
do I get a time limit?. (:
y'know.. I'm not all that certain.. One of them is about how to spend 100,000$/10,000$ on the school
and the other is either about how I can help out as an NHS member, or where I see myself in 20 years. and then the other is a synthesis essay. And yay :D that sounds good
If I knew how I could help :P or where I'll be in 20 years
having fun :D
or um.. changing the world? :P by... having fun? :d. :D*. hm, I don't know if that quite demostrates the 4 pillars of NHS :P. lol sorry, that's silly . of me
I like your ideas though :D. service, leadership, character.. and um.. something ese. else*. community maybe?
oh wait... scholarship
If it were something to make NHS people happy? or just legitimately what I think? :P
or maybe it can be both?
:d!. :D*. (:. I like your questions. Well, I like voluteering, so I'd like to do that. But people say that using your free time for that gives you less free time to be with family, so I don't think I'd do that too often. And I don't know if I'd be very wealthy or anything, but I'd donate all my stuff anyway! just not a lot, because I'd probably be one of those people that needs stuff donated to them because I donated too much away :P. And I'd bake cookies for my neighbors :D
this is true :D. but what if I spend all my time working to support my family? :P. lol sorry
lol :P What if we're both starving artists? Or maybe I'm just a single parent with 50 kids. :P
lol I'd like turning in an essay that says all this
aw, I hope so :D Stuff always turns out nicely anyway, so I shouldn't worry :D
(: aw. I'll be there for you too :D
through thin and thick ;D
:D*. lol :P I think I might rather write the essay about what I could do right now. Futures are difficult. but voluteering is fun :D
yay :D
And I'd like to research medicine and products and stuff. lol yeah :D. there are 3 choices, and I have to pick 2
yay :D I like fun!
I like easy peasy too :D. (:. aw :3. I like you.
Thank you for the good luck :D
And I don't know if I'm allowed to, but if I did, I'd invite you (:
Thank you for all the support (:. And bye for now :D. Have fun with everything!!
(:. I love you too (:. :3. bye for now
HI :D!. hi*. :P. Whoops.
So I've been working super hard and I got done with my synthesis essay :D. 8) lol nice cool smiley. or um.. 8| *. lol cool people don't smile
because I don't smile? :P. :D
yay :D. I don't think it reads very well, but maybe someone out there will like it. :P It's something about school systems and conformity and stuff. I think you're really cool and I like your smile (:. I think next I'll write how I can contribute to our school :D. maybe I can um.. lend a hand everywhere, and be a tutor-er
but mostly just all the stuff I already do.. . hmm, what could an NHS member do differently that a normal student can't? :P. thank you for the good luck :D
:P psh, official-ness is silly.. but tutoring people is pretty fun/nice :D. I think.. I need to be a better one o.o
guinea pigs are cute (: 
You're so so so amazing :3
aw, okay :D. sorry I went over the time limit by a lot :/ 
You're really really nice :D
(: It's so so true. I'll get back to writing though :D.  bye for now and have lots of fun :D
:D as long as I get to go sledding with you tomorrow at track :D. (:
hey, well that's okay :D I think it'll snow next weekend (:
well no one can predict the weather :D!. :P (sort of)
That sounds fun :D. but maybe not alone
snow? :D@!!!!. whoa, when? :D. I like snow (:
:D (:. sounds nice
!!! you gotta go do that now then :D!!. :P. And I better keep writing. (: fun everywhere outside (:
I'll have a snowball fight with you :D. and there are some hills here :D
I'm gonna finish my applications really really fast. hopefully. I think I know what to write. :D you should play in the snow (:
or I"ll bring the snow to you :P. thank you :d. :D*. bye for now!
(:. sooo cute
That's impossible :P. but when I said "sooo cute," I was actually talking about you :P. :D. but whoa, you're really good at finding cute pictures.. (:. thank you for that
(: You're so so cute. I love you.. sorry :P
psh, not crazy, just honest (:. And in love :P. but maybe that goes along with crazy..
Maybe a little. :P Or it's just crazy that you love the person you do (:
(: I love you dough dough dough much
(:. sooo crazy. hmm
:D
Snow is really really nice :D
(: I do really really want to.. I was tramping around out there this morning to take at least a few pictures
I think I kind of fell on ice though :P. but it was still fun :D!!!
aw (:!!. lol I would like both of those scenarioes, as long as you didn't get hurt. (:. And that's another good reason to play out in the snow with you :D. you could catch me (:. And I could catch you :D. if you were to fall at all
whee :D
I wish that too, but I'm afraid it'll be too late and the snow will all melt, so we'll just have to make a grassman instead---but that'll be fun anyway because it'll be with you (:. I'm working on my thingy write now :D. right*
We could!! :D. lol after mowing lawns.. :D. he'd be more like a grass blob, but that's cool too :D. Bob the Grass Blob :D
noooooo.... not the snoowww :P
(:!! soo much fun. I'll just go outside and lay it in for awhile :P sledding should never be done alone though, if avoidable :D
(: nah, I've never ever sledded alone before.. "And I'm not about to start." :P
Maybe, but it's more the people you're with that make it fun :D. Along with the sledding :D
(:. It does sound like a lot of fun though... hmm.. :P
I'll go do it write after I finish this first essay :P. right* :P
yay (:. I'm excited!
:D!! lol because it's snow (:
thank you :D. (: I hope you have bunches of fun too
please do (:
:D
why not? :/ 
sledding? :D. There's always room to make something to do (:
(: I love you :D
(:
I love you too (:. and you're not a bother at all! I'm just sorry I wasn't on facebook at the time. ahh, and I only missed you by 10 minutes. You're really really cool though :D. rawr (:. Hi. sorry :P. G'night for now Peter :D!!. see you tomorrow (:
!!! :D!. hi (:. sorry. too late?
:D . sleep is *yawn*.. silly. :P. I finished all my essays :D
yay :D!. I didn't get anyone to proofread them yet though..
aw :D. It'd be cool, but definitely not now, because it's all late and stuff :P
oh yeah :D. Whoa, buses are hard to catch. And aw, dizzy?. how did you hit your head? o.o. Second growth spurt? :P
ouch o.o
I hope you're okay!. I should've caught ou (:. you*
I like the word 'gotsta' :D. I think they make them bright yellow so they're a little easier to catch.. I should've been nearby anyway (:. lol :P but then I'd be all stalker-y
yay :D I hope it's not too cold tomorrow. but at least there will be some snow that might stick around
:D!! I'll see you tomorrow to. And how can one be sorry for the future?. too*
o.o!! What will happen?. if you care to disclose..
when it happens? :P. Well, I can assure you that you don't need to be sorry. unless you're planning to kick a puppy :P
but that'd be impossible for someone like you :D. nooo, it's too terrible
o.o. but... http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/2202518_700b_v1.jpg. :P
aww.. it's so so cute :D. lol pirate. but it's eyes are just a little bit peering and stuffs. :D. you're cute :D
I think you're cute (:. so we're even?. Whoaaaaa!!! :o. it's today!!. ahh. :P
:D I should let you get to sleep too :D. Thank you, and sweet dreams to you too :D!. lol :P And good morning, of course (:. or um.. good midnight?. (:
headache? I'm sorry :( is it from falling?. And it could be a good idea if it's not on an empty tummy--but normally sleeping does the trick :D
:D Then that might be a good thing, so that you can get some sleep. And it makes sense
It's not silly at all (:. Need me to sing you a lullaby too? :3. lol :P That might have the risk of waking you up more instead though.. with all the terrible sounds and everything
:P. :3 maybe with a bias ear (:. I hope your headache feels better, and I hope you're okay
That I'm really a terrible singer? :P
I think you have the wrong idea, because all this time, I've been thinking that you matter so so much, and I know it's true.. :P okay :D
And you're amazing (:. :3. but I really should let you get to sleep
(: It's okay, I'm gonna be up awhile longer, but I'll try to sleep soon :D. I really hope your head gets better and I can't wait to see you tomorrow (:
I'm just finishing up the "qualifications" part of my essay. application*. lol :P beds are really good at that. I can resist though :D

you're super extraordinary (:
ahh, I really hope this isn't too late, and the page didn't have quite as much info as I hoped, but it's all pretty concise and maybe could be helpful :D http://apush-review.wikispaces.com/Teddy+Roosevelt
ooh, and here's what the textbook says about him, orgainized all chronologically and stuff! :D http://wikinotes.wikidot.com/chapter-28-13. (: you're so so amazing. whoa, what's that?

oh nos!
Well, that's okay mostly, there's still time :D. and I can help!. awww :( tearing? is that from the cold too?
Or was the thing you were looking for too sad?
:D! Is it oatmeal, or more of a mashed potatoes consistency? :P
aw, well maybe that means you should get to sleep soon :D I was just about too :D. maybe I can call and wish you goodnight soon? :D
(: So I can assure you that your brain is never mush. And to tell you about stuffs
and just to talk (:
lol :P ahh, that's scary.. You really should eat more calcium.. :P. just kidding
yay :D
:D This guy has nice songs, but that question doesn't look like it's part of the lyrics
Then it's a crazy thought (: Sorry to say.. You're the only guy that I want to have every adventure imaginable with!!
You're so so special (:. Hey, can I call you in 15 minutes or so to wish you goodnight? :D
facebook makes everything sound different anyways :D. okay :D bye for now (: And if you hear a ring.. that might be me :D

(: Don't worry about that :D. ttfn :D!. ! Oh hi :D I just wanted to wish you a super duper amazing day. lol :P I think I stayed up much too late last night playing a certain game involving hamsters. :D 
Rawr!! Hi :D!!. And that's okay :D I don't know what you'd even have to be sorry for. You're amazing!!!! (emphasis as rainbows explode everywhere and sparkle and shoot candy!! ) :D 
:D!! As crazy as skateboarding on a tightrope?. Cause I've done that.. . :P But you do it bunches better than I do!. Text messages?. You're more than good enough :D!! You're like.. to infinity and beyond!. even if it upsets Mr. Murphy (I'm already a little scared at his mug-shot worthy pictures hanging in our physics classroom :P. Sadly, I believe my phone might be exponentially decaying (just what I'm studying!) in a corner somewhere :P
You? Not so great to talk to? !!! That's like saying the world just spontaneously combusted and is headed on a crash course to um.. some far away planet? :P Yeah, that's crazy.. (:. Plus I'm already so so super duper excited that you're on facebook (:. !!!!.  :D!!
Do I have to make another story about the world ending in an impossible catastrophe to prove how amazing you are? (okay, so maybe it's not the best approach...) :P
If I haven't said the same a thousand times before Any such notion would leave my heart just as sore. You're winsome and dazzling, no arguments could pass the lips of anyone who's been so keen to pass the time with you.  And certain I will always object to any future circumstance; to abash the likes of you is every consequence, but if I've ever missed the chance, don't leave it to the second-hand, I'll stand by with open hands and whisper words of neverland to tell you everything I can't and near stop my heart with passing glances, of run-on sentences and overused rhymes. (: 
I would've ended that cheesier if I didn't stop myself :P. yummm :3 macaroni and cheese.
Maybe so :D I've got my hands full, but my tummy empty. :P. History textbooks make subtle jokes :P. sometimes
lol yeah, it's like a built in comedy central. :D
Except, I had to look it up to understand it, so I'm not sure if that takes away the funny. :P. "Not much of a joke if you have to explain it.". ah sorry, I'll let you get going too. How has your day been, if I may ask? (:
o.o No way! That always seems to happen one way or another, it's like a sneaky way for vampires to have more opportunities to strike! . Good thing that bandaid got on eventually :P. aw, what did those text messages say? :D 
And my day has been pretty alright :D It wasn't so rainy today, but I've had to study way above my 'studying tolerance' level (which is right around an hour) :P. aw, you don't have to be sorry for anything. Especially not anything that causes a loop of sorries :P
Every action of yours is completely forgiven, even before you say it--I could never ever ever blame you. :3 So no worries
I know what you mean, but I don't know if that applies to you--you're so so so super amazing (:
Well I always feel sorry :/  but that's for different waters (is that an expression? maybe it can be now.. :P)
And that's ridikerous!! (Have I been using that too much?- sorry to steal it from tigger :P). you don't have to be sorry for anything (:. I'm not sure if you realize how lucky I am just to be talking to you... Well I'm going to tell you... :P. I'm so so so so so lucky, luckier than any amount of four leaf clovers could ever dictate, and that's quite a large amount of luck.  It surprises me every time I ever stop to think about it and it leaves me mystified knowing how the likes of you (those are pretty high likes) could talk to the likes of me (pretty low likes :P) . oh um.. rawr :3
^_^. (:. :3. ahh, I'm all smiley now. But I do have a bit of a rumble in my tummy :P
(Gladly, it doesn't sound like an unfriendly dog)
oh yes, I mean, a rumbly :P. rwer
:P aw, I'll try not to. maybe I have to eat more of those smiley tater tots
!!! Whoa!! That's such a good idea! I've never done that before :P. (:. I gotta try that one day!! :D. Dibs on elvis hair.. :P
And then my tater tot would be all like "Thank you, thank you very much." When I eat him :P
!! yay (;. (:*. hmm.. knees feel weird.. :P
:P nah, they feel weird :P like bones or something.. ewwy. :P. lol. whoa!!. Elbows feel weird too. teehee, and funny :P . sorry :P
:|3 
That's as close as I could get to a smiley blushing, but I think it just looks like a silly mustache instead :P. Even you?
Well you're the only guy I want..
I'd choose you a million times over if someone asked me to pick . I think you're better for me than anything (: Even riboflavin :P
No, no there is'nt. isn't* :P
And rightfully so, because you're ever shooting star wish and you're all the unpopped bubbles on a sheet of bubblewrap... every*. And you're all the nice things that make life wonderful (:. !!!
It's a snowman :D. Whoaaa. How'd you do that?. (:
Oh whoops :P
aw (:. Well it's so so so cool :D!!. I wish I could make little snowmen appear in the middle of summer! :P. aw.. Peter... I'm afraid that my worksheet about Labor Unions is calling :P
Ridikerous, I say :P. Whoa!! . There's something crazy going on in my housie..
yeah!! :D. well, wait.. no. :p. maybe in my tummy... but I digress.. :P. lol 'but I digest'. :P. oh um... um..
ooh! Rook to C7. I like yours even better :P
Anywho!!. That balloon!!!!!!! :D
It's still floating!!!. It's magic!
(: I think you infused some magic into it. somehow
:D! I knew you were a wizard ever since you made that coin flip all perfect and magically :D. And that chess board!
'Sorcery!' :P. ah, alright :D. (: Goodnight to you too (:. And some especially sweet dreams. I hope your ones last night were nice too (:
:/ aw, that other one doesn't sound very sweet though. It sounds like more like a nightmare. I hope I always get to hug you . or at least talk to you bunches and have thumb wars :D. :3. I'll have to see that snowman in all it's pt 72 font glory some time :P
You're the greatest. :3 
I should learn to be more convincing (: That way you can see it too
Maybe some 3-d glasses would work... and you'd see how amazing you are (:. sorry, it's silly of me to say
Feeling how, exactly?. :D then the rumblies in my tummy won't stand a chance :P
And thank you for being here to talk to (:
Then I'm not doing my job very well.. I just gotta try harder (:. Talking to you makes the world seem like a giant kinder egg :D
!! The very bestest surprise inside (:. like a really nice acorn necklace :D. or even better, a Peter (:. The most coveted surprise of all (:
So rare!; even the best collectors stand nary a chance to sight the single Peter in existence . Oh, you must be talking about that Peter Pan surprise--No, this is much much rarer, it's the elusive Peter Mattox (:. :p. sorry
As are you. (: The very best sort of silly. I like you too :3. I hope you have some very very sweet dreams tonight; those worthy of a Peter (: 
Hearing them from you is the nicest thing (: And so fillled with butterflies, that'd you'd think it was Mexico :P 
It's a lot of butterflies, right? (:. awww :D. :3. }|{
I second that. I miss you dough dough much.. sorry :P 
:3 awww... My hearts all melting right now.. but I just wanted to let you know that it's all yours. (:
:3 It wouldn't be a fair trade if all you get is my heart... I better throw in some cheesecake too or something. but as for you, being with you is way better than any cookies :D
(: Your heart is of the purest caliber though. (: Thank you for being amazing as always. :D I like talking to you. . And I'll bring it to you tomorrow!. Thank you for lending it to me and I'm sorry I've had it checked out for so long :P
(do I have a fine on it now?)
I'm not, it's just lying dormant on my desk--I may have to delete a few files on it though :P
:3 It doesn't sound like much of a fine :P. (:. lol fine. :P
but I'm still bringing it :D
I'm getting all the 'fine's mixed up. :P. maybe you're right about the unethicalness.. hmm.. how are... keebler cookies?. or do you just have way too many of those at home?
Well I don't need to be fined to give you cookies or hugs (:. That's stuff that I like (:
You're really really cool :D Goodnight and sweet dreams (:

You're so magically amazing, that wizards are jealous (:

:D yeah!
probably however long it takes to get down there (:

I wanted to say thank you so so so so dough much for everything and that you're the most amazing ever and I'm sorry for sleeping on you and attacking you and stuffs and you do all the most bestest things and you're such a good runner and I like you so so much! (: And thank you for letting me play your hamtaro and pokemon games!
Oh it can stay there for as long as it wants (: I'm sure it feels very at home next to your bike (: but maybe just before it rains because I left the helmet and light out there and the seat seems susceptible to moisture(funny word) :P. aw (: attacking you is the most fun and sleeping on you was the most comfiest nicest thing ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (:!!!!!!
oh that'd be nice!!! (: but as much as I'd love to see you, I'm not sure if my mother would allow it :/ . Maybe it can be for another day when I have lots of time that I can spend with you!! (:
aw :/ my mom kind of said she doesn't want me to randomly invite you over. And besides, how would you get home after riding my bike over? :d. :D*. I can always come pick it up one day!. maybe after track!. because I'd walk to your house and then bike home! (:
Whoa! :D That'd be soooo cool! (: You are quite ninja!, but I don't think I'd want you to get so close without me being able to see you! (: It's quite a hike over here too!

(:. I think I might submit a photo to the Art Show :P
or two :P

Hey, I was thinking it was pretty true (:
!!!! You have so so much stuff you could submit (:. And all of it is of amazing qualithy. quality* ;P. :P*
It's true.. so true (:
Oh yeah, something new sounds cool :D If you had to pick between all the things you've ever done that'd be way too tough of a decision because they're all so good. (:. And I think you're pretty creative (:
I'm not positive yet, I have a few ones though, but they're just a little ordinary :P
Whoa, like the really good one? :D!!. I'd like to, but I don't have any time before the art show, so I think I'll just use one of the ones I've already taken :P. Thank you though!! (:
:D!! It's a really nice idea (: I've never used a really big camera on my own before though, so I might need a crash course first :P I'd like to go on a photo walk with you sometime (:
that it would (:
An idea? :D!
oh um... *whispers* An idea? :D!
!! (: What's your idea?
aw, not even in person? P. :P*
!!!!! Really? (: yay!!!. You know what that means? :D
It means that I get to hear a secret tomorrow, maybe! (: . But better yet, I'll get to see this super amazing guy!! (:
It's this guy I know who's really fun to tackle (:. Ideas for what to make?
Because he gets tackled? :P maybe that makes him a little more on the unlucky side. Especially if there's really sharp grass around.. :P
(: I don't know how it could ever be considered lucky. Especially if it's during a football game.. Ooh, and as for ideas.. well, what category were you thinking of?
:P 1d!. :P. hmm.. You could always do a comic strip! :D. That's art, right? :D. or.. hmm..
(: I think anything that you'd do would suffice in an art show! (: Even any of your doodles that you do. Those are pretty magnificent! (:. Byebye for now to you too! (: ooh, and goodnight! Seeing you tomorrow will be oodles of fun!. And sweet dreams to you too! (: byebye
(: And to you too!. :D
I was just thinking the same thing about you! :P
Oh, it's not a bad thing, I was just surprised I got on Facebook just after you sent that :P Must be sixth sense or something :P  lol yeah, you're right (: just a little bit.. *falls asleep*
(: 
is it striped? :D. lol :P
Was it striped yesterday?. because that one was the very bestest ever and the person who it belonged to was even better. (:
Whoa! :D
It did (:
Well you're the best, so that makes your shoulder the bestest pillow ever (:. And you can use me as a pillow too if you'd wish to (:
(: I'd be honored to be squished by you. . :3
Yeah, you're right. But I'll take any excuse to be close to you. (:
(: Oh, that's just crazy! :P I'm just me. But what's even crazier is.. I was just thinking that about you. :D
Being with you is soo easy though. You make it feel like playtime and fun stuff all the time! (:
I don't feel like I do anything right half the time :/ I always get all nervous and then I can't say or do anything right.. but getting to be around you is amazing and so I gotta keep trying to get it right so that I can continue to be around you. (:
(: aw.. . :D okay :D!!! Sweet dreams to you too Peter (: I like you very much!
Oh no, a sigh? I wonder why.. . Oh hey, I was thinking that Woody and Buzz thing would be very cool (: All I'd need is some um.. colored duct tape possibly :D!
:D You'd be a pretty awesome Woody :P. Just don't get any snakes in your boots!. Bye for now (:
Oh, but the sigh?
psh, cowboy boots are silly anyway (:
a silly sigh?. And that's okay too (: . Shall we save Buzz and Woody for another day then? (:
perhaps a day in the fall? That starts with the letter H?
Oh, that's fine (: I was actually a little worried about making everything look as cool as I wanted in such a short time
yeah :D. something else (:
:D (: We still have a bit to decide. Maybe we'll have an epiphany tomorrow :P . oh um.. on another note, I'm still a little stumped. on something about poofiness :P. sorry again..
:D!! Up is indeed a Disney movie!. I'd like to find something that you'd like :P
!! yup yup (:
even if it squishes my face? :P

Oh yeah! Packing is lots of fun! (: Don't forget something comfy.

Whoa, I don't want any opt out. I like you (:. I never ever ever want to lose you for as long as you're as happy as possible with having me (:

Maybe I can make you un-sorry (: Let me know if you need help packing or anything. (: 
(: Anyway I can, I'd like to. But okay :D! . :D!. Maybe I'll rehearse my presentation with my mom ;P. :P*
I wish I knew what.. I only know about one thing, but I'm not sure that's what you're sorry for, and if it it.. then trust me, you don't need to be at all!
Aww (;. (:. Lucky!. But then again, I get to cuddle up with silly old winnie the pooh and sushi cat and piglet and a rabbit and enough super nice clothes to make a comfy blanket with
(:. I'd attain crazy amounts of luckiness if it was all that and then this really nice sillyhead (:. You give me soooo many butterflies.. :3
(: aw okay, but I hope I'll have lots of chances to talk to you! Byebye for now!
(: You're amazing, there's no need to be sorry! I'll talk to you tomorrow!!! (:
Thank you :D. Yay! I just got back
(: Yeah! . We ate foods and talked (:
It was quite alright (:. It sure made me excited for the summer program though!
(:. Really really.. Have you been having a nice day? (:
Yes (: I think it's been nice, despite all the chilly wind! Don't blow away!!. (:
And now you're typing this from an island of the coast of Santa Monica I suppose? (:
:P Oh, when did I do that? I don't recall..
As long as I didn't permanently explode it (:
Perfect (: It's one of the best that my minds ever met :D
(:. I have a favor to ask..
May I um.. call you to talk? maybe.. just a little? . (:. And say good night?
wait, the good night part is a surprise (:. Of course. (:
(:!!. I would most definitely like to. So you know what that means (:
(: I hope so too. It's nice hearing your voice!  Sweet dreams. (:. Byebye!
Oh hi! :D. Sorry, I just wanted to let you know that my phone is a little nonfunctional just a bit. :P This may have started sometime around 2:00 yesterday when I was texting you. I was hoping it would make a quick recovery, but at this time, all we can do is wait and see... (sounds like a doctor) :P . I hope your day is going very nicely today! (: Oh, as for the climbing thing, I might be a little fuzzy on the details, but I'll check and let you know if it could possibly happen. Maybe we could go after school is over? :D. Oh, if you were still interested, of course. (:. Oh yeah, climbing not so much today, as the group I was considering going with met at 12pm :P I've never been real rock climbing though, so if you'd like to, I'd be honored if you would go with me for a day in the summer :D! (:. I'm gonna go keep cleaning my room for now. :P I'm so planning for a wall of stuff. Have bunches of fun! (:
 :/ Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking forward to it too, but now I'm just looking forward to something a bit further in the future? I guess I just have some stuff to get done too, mostly getting my room all clean and working on some posters and that video. And I think school work might be lurking somewhere down there too. :P I'm really sorry for being busy way too often. :/ I feel really bad about it, especially when I propose things that I can't do. I don't ever want to make you sad about it or anything--I didn't think it'd be something you'd look forward too much either. It's just me after all.. But on another note,  I had a ginger snap yesterday! (: . And it was good (:
Oh um, thought what was just silly? . sorry to ask
Oh, I was definitely taking that seriously! It sounds like so much fun especially with you too. (: I just didn't expect me not finishing everything yesterday :/ And some other stuff.  
Yay :D It's Keane!
You never ever waste my time. (: Every second talking to you is the best use of time. Or at least its never regretted. Whereas, I could say differently about time spent on homework  and trivial things like those. :P. Oh thank :P lol it's really outdated considering its April already.. thanks*
Oh, whoa! :P
lol I don't know what other picture to use though.. hmm.. maybe it'll just stay like that. :P. Yo're not a waste of time at all. :D Did'ja read that last message? (: I love talking to you.
And you're not in my way, so no need to get out of it. :P. it's okay :d. :D*
aw :D really?
:P I always feel weird picking out photos of myself to use on facebook.
Aw :/ I'm really sorry. I should've thought about that and everything.. Oh yeah :P I think my mom might want those. I bet you were an awesome photographer! :P Even if it wasn't a preferable subject :P. Thank you for taking those.
Just having pictures is all that matters I suppose :D . I should go finish cleaning my room
I guess I shouldn't guarantee anything :/ but I was hoping if I finished. I don't know, maybe if I did it'd be really cool if you could help me hang up some stuff for a Wall of Stuff :D. But none of this is a solid plan or anything since it depends on my fastness :/ And knowing me, I'll be working till 2 o clock. de la manana
:/ ah, I don't know why, but talking about all this stuff makes me feel really sad. :/ I don't want to disappoint you by not being free. I guess it's just stuff I have to get done. But I want you to know that I really love being with you, and doing everything with you is so so much fun! . :/ I just.. feel terrible :'(. sorry :P now I just sound dramatic.
And I suppose that un-smiley wasn't neccesary :P. I know :/ but I don't want it to make you sad. . or be disappointed in me :/
I don't care if I'm distracted, especially when it's by you. (: You're amazing, and you're not even distracting me from anything either. (: . And I'm not really busy, I just have things to complete sometime today.
ah, I have a terrible work ethic anyway, so I probably wouldnt' even be working if I wasn't talking to you. . If it'd make you feel better.. I just felt like I missed out on talking to you for most of yesterday.. How is your weekend going? (: Is what I'd like to ask.. And just to say 'hi' and stuff.
Mines going well. :P I was sorting through some stuff in my closet and I randomly stayed up super late this morning watching old people play pranks on young'n's. . It's a really interesting tv show... :P. And I watched the beginning of New Girl, but that got weird really quickly :P so then I watched mythbusters.
It was really late but I couldn't fall asleep :P. huh?
lol 'huh' looks like such a weird thing to type..
I just meant like.. why so sudden, or something?
:/ you're not though. Really, I'd just like to talk to you... You always make me feel better. (:. And you're always really nice. . Oh, and that's okay :P Like I had said, I figured I had gotten enough sleep friday night when I slept for about 14 hours :P
The things really aren't so important though, so I can stay for however long you'd like to talk. (:. if you'd like to (:
:P Trust me, I've gone without having a clean room for a while now, and nothing tooo bad has happened.. And as for the campaigning, I'm not as worried as I should be about that. :P
Aw, you think so? I'm also not so sure even what to put on the posters :P. Like, how exactly do you just ask people to vote for you? I feel like if they wanted to vote, they would... hmm.. maybe I'll just make one that just tells people I'm running?. I'm not so sure... Maybe I don't need any :P
Ooh, okay (: Lunch time I suppose? :D. (: Have bunches of fun.. I work super hard so that missing a fun time with you isn't for naught. I'll*. (: Well, bye for now then. :D
hello there :D
:P. Well it was anything to get rid of that nameless character of my prior picture :P. :P. but thank you
(:. Thank you.
:3
I like you.. jinx! :D
double jinx
:P I owe you..
a soda. :D
Whichever kind you prefer
Nope, it's perfect sense :D. (:. I gotta wish you sweet dreams for now--I still have to study a little more and do some history homework. :D And some calculations for physics class! :D
Oh, by the way, thanks a bunch again for letting me borrow your camera 
!! We better go do our stuffs then!. :D
!! Calculus for me too :P. I'm going to work through as many problems as I can!
If you need anything explained, I could try to help. Whoa, no kidding?! :D!!!. That's sooooo awesome!. I've decided that I really really like your catapult slingshot (:
It looks easy to make, but it has like a fancy "one-click release" and cool triangular features
The only reason I'd suggest any other ideas is if it can't go the whole 150 feet. :D. I've decided simplicity is nice--I'll save the hours of work on a catapult for the summer or something :D
yup yup :D
The tray-bucket can be the back up :P
It looks like it has a lot of parts and will take having some extra lumber lying around. ohh I'm sorry :( that's not what I meant. Occam's Razor rules here. I just heard that some of the elastic powered catapults are only hitting up to 60 feet--but who knows what the one you designed could do :D!
I like the one you designed :D!!!. It's totally the bestest. 
(After we test it of course :D)
lol :P It's definitely an option. Where it goes, no one knows--but it's going far.. :P
? . It's all good ideas (:
Did you know in a brainstorm, all ideas are good?. and should be considered :D. It seems like a good practice. And I like your catapult!. I still have it! (:
the best it could be would take years of testing :P It's crazy, I looked at a thing, and there are soo many variables that affect distance. Most of them having to do with reducing friction and something about 'swing arm length' but I'd say it'd come pretty close to best if you made it :D. :D okay (: I'll let you get to things too!. I wish you super amazing luck on everything. And if you need anything, or any help, feel free to call :D
oh no, really? :P. I'm sorry, I had my home phone in mind when I said that. I think my other phone is out at the bowling alley right now for his Tuesday meeting. :P. He's working on his backswing
:D I think it'll work, but I guess it's good to have a backup (: Maybe we could construct on Friday evening?
:D I have the energy potential calculations covered
yup yup :D. it's totally happening. And I could always make the blueprints on inventor or something... hmm. That might be after we build it though :P. or just a little drawing. I just want to be able to help as much as I can.. Maybe we can both draw it (:. ahh, I better get going/let you get going. I'm glad you were on Facebook to talk to (:. (since I didn't answer my phone) :P
Sweet dreams, Peter. (:
Byebye! :D!!!
(:!. And it's you!
And my smiley is wearing an exclaimation point as a hat!
:P It should've had some class and wore a vegetable instead.. :D
:P Well maybe I was cool back then, but any hope that I had spontaneously vaporized when I stopped playing with my food. :P
That sounds like a disease. :P I'm not sure if I want cool hanging around me all day. I need some space. :3. :P. Aw, none of my smileys are showing up for me. All those words have a completely different meaning without them :P
okay (: I suppose that's all that matters!. I may possibly need to go back to studying for biology :P I get distracted wayyy too easily (:
unless you'd like to hear me explain different biological facts to you. :P. (: thank you for the good luck!. And you're so so so so cool!
Sweet dreams to you too. (: oh yeah, I wish you the best in working on your english paper!
(: Byebye home fry :P!
You're amazing? (:. :D . because that's true (:
Only sometimes, and unfortunately, those times do involve vegetables. :P. ('Not this again...') :P
:D Well thank you, though I can't say I agree!. :D. (: 
And it's an opinion that makes me all smiley (: 
Whoaa.. you really are floating in that picture!
It's pretty neat :P I imagine you held that pose the whole race and just used the force to float across the finish line.
(: I'll study-udy-udy! :D byebye and have fun making witty arguments :p
(: . oh um.. hey Peter?
This is a little silly, but yesterday was super fun, and being with you made me all smiley, and I was thinking that well... I think I really like you.. sorry 
(: really?
:D! Aw.. I'm glad you think so too! (:
I just thought I should let you know, even if it's not so important
You always cheer up my days (:
(: . And okay, but you're a nice distraction. :D I better stop distracting you from English stuffs too. Or just taking up your time. (: Bye for now and have a very nice dinner.. It was nice to tell you.
Whoa pizza! :D I hope yesterday's pizza and accompanying slugs didn't make pizza boring for you. :P. And that's okay--I actually still have some leftover :P
That's good :D! What kinds of toppings are you partaking in? :D
!!! That's a mighty fine combination. :P Thanks for suggesting pineapples to me on pizza--I don't think I ever had them nearly as much before.. (: It's okay though, any time is pizza time! :D
(:. I do in fact like cold pizza, but I don't think any of my classes are having any pizza parties. :P
Pizza parties are all happening on Friday :P. just kidding, I don't think there are any--but it's a nice thought :D. (: sorry for the late response, I had to tend to a certain pizza box I forgot to recycle :P. but I guess we should get to stuffs :d. :D*. byebye for now (:
Farewell :3. hmm.. Do you think I could ask you a question or two about the family project?
:D oh I was just wondering a few things.. Should the timelines be just typed up on Word, or should they be in an actually line on a poster or something?  and what might be an acceptable length for the autobiography?. actual*. sorry for these questions by the way
Okay awesome :D. I think I will go for the poster too! (:. Thank you for the help
(: yay thank you! I will. It'll be fun writing things about my life.. Is any outside research necessary, or is it just what I know off the top of my head?. like, for the autobiography
I suppose you're right :D . My grandchildren would like to know accurate information.. :D
(: Thanks again, and bye for now!
hello! :D. Sorry, you're probably still at school!. Whoa, I hope you finished your English paper though--I should have asked.. The catapult launch was super cool (: I'm glad it worked out and everything!
Whoa, that's not too too late (:
!!! Hi (:
How are you doing? (:
I'm alright too (:. Last day of intense homework and studying for me this school year! (:
actually, who am I kidding, I'm not a very intense study-er.  Most of my studying consists of me getting up to get crackers and water :P
It can be :P Especially when I have to choose between the rosemary kind or the vegetable herb.. :P
:P Oh, it is.. (: Well I'll go finish everything up and get ready for tomorrow!. I hope you got a teensy bit of sleep yesterday. You're really nice to work with (:
!! yay (: that's good. sleep is important :D
:D super duper amazing? . :P
yay!!! :F. :D*. lol. The first one looks like it has scary teeth
I didn't mean to, but I took a nap and didn't wake up :P
(: I think I slept well though. yeah :D The bed just draws people in
It's all devious like that. yeah :D!
more awesomeness :D. :P
Be a bed?. :P
aw (:. Wait, is that a good thing? :P
You make me sleepy because you're all warm. and safe. and nice
lol no, I was just thinking of the cliche that people fall asleep from bordem. :D
You and boring don't even live on the same continent :p. I'm not sure you two have ever met :P
:P. sorry. silly stuffs :D To emphasize how awesome you are. and how not boring you are :D. Ahh, I better go do school stuffs. I guess it's just one more night of works :D. I'll work super hard :D. (:. You're super cool. super is a funny word :P. because it can turn into supper if letters sneak in
:D. (:. It's still light out. :D. or for later?
I hope you have sweet dreams too if I don't talk to you later (:. Okay (:. I'll have everything finished and stuffs :D. byebye for now! (:. Thank you for the nice talk. rawr.! *puff of smoke*
:D aw. (far away voice-since I poofed away already :P). Byebye! :D
(: Bye amazing guy.. Have fun with everything today!! :D I have your barbells :P. (that's what my mom called them..) :P
:D. That's a nice name for it :D. I like your name (:. oh um, bye for now! :D. I like you very much. (as a certain sandwich bag may have told you). (:
:3. ttfn (:
:J. Here's the thingy! I was going to add you to the conversation instead, but I'm totally Facebook knowledgeable :P This is the plan for prom. We decided(I wish you could have come, Leandra!) that to avoid stress, this is going to be the definitive prom plan. If you have a huge problem, please talk to us face to face and not on this. Otherwise, to avoid indecisiveness lets please try to stick to this as much as you can. If you want to do something different with your date don't worry, this isn't some obligation.  Plan: -3:00 Girls come over to my house (Erin) 1008 Village Way North and we get pre-ready. Our thoughts are that we would not eat in our dresses, but do hair and things before we eat and final stuff after. -5:30 dates arrive at Erin's house to eat (pot luck style, a list is at the bottom of reminders of what to bring.) -Whenever we finish, go take pictures. We will definitively have to go by 7:15 or else the sun will go down. -After pictures hang out at my house and do fun things to avoid showing up at prom awkwardly early. -After prom is over each couple can decide if they want to change or stay in their prom attire. Whoever wants to change is welcome to come back and do so at Erin's house. -Go to after prom, check it out. If it sucks, go back to Erin's house and have tons of fun, if it's fun there stay and have tons of fun. -Whenever we get hungry, breakfast at Ihop. -Then the girls are welcome to stay the night(morning) and sleep over at Erin's house. Yeah. That was longer than I thought. Potluck food list: Erin-Mac&Cheese, sweet tea (I'm sure my dad will probably want to do more) Emily & Paige-Potatoes scalloped, chip dip, chips, Italian chicken and rice Leyla-salad Cara- Whatever dessert you can(Peaches and Cream) Leandra-Any thing you would like  If it's okay, can you ask the guys to bring these things? Cam- Paper plates and plastic cups Garrett- Forks, knives, napkins Corey- Something yummy Tim- Something yummy Ethan- If he comes, which I hope he does, something yummy Peter- Drinks (soda or lemonade or both) And if you or your dates want to bring more than this, everyone is more than welcome to. Also just so everyone has this, my phone number is 540-577-9859 If all the girls are good with everything, you can add your dates to this message!! Love,  Erin, Emily, and Paige. I can help you out with bringing the soda if you want, as I have a bunch lying around and because I told you so last minute :P
Oh I heard about that!!. We should totally go if you can!. it'd be so so cool!. Rawr :D. sorry. oh and if your friends are doing something for Prom and you'd like to join them, then that would be cool too! :D Because I realize that most of these people will be people that you don't know besides Tim and I wouldn't want you to miss out on anything!. Oh and I hope you did/are doing awesomely at the track meet!!. (:. It was so cool seeing you at school yesterday!. :D. sorry :P
:D okay! And I can totally make it!. The movie starts playing at 8:30, so maybe we could get there at 8:10 ish?. do do wop.. maybe I should call? :D. maybe I'll go get ready.. yeah, that sounds good. :D
of course :D
:D not so crazy. I was looking for a blanket, but I couldn't find any :(. Oh and just wondering, are you wearing shorts or jeans?
okay, maybe I should too?. lol good idea :P
my foot is eaten up :P
I could find a blanket, but not one to go on all terrain :P. so perhaps a sacrificial blanket :P. :D 
And shouwd I bring a pillow? :D. should*. aw :D yay
or two pillows? :P. i wouldn't mind
really really :D as long as its big enough for two
And as long as you wouldn't mind sharing with someone like me
okay :D
:D oh, I can bring a pillow!. it won't be in pet form, but I have a pillow too :D
Whoa! no way :D. hmm. :D. should I bring a pillow anyway? :P. I suppose I should head down soon :D. I'll bring a snack or two too. hmm.. what kind of food would you like the mostest?
Whoa! pizza?
I'm okay mostly because I had dinner, but one tiny slice would be cool :D. anywho, I should get down there. :D so, just myself?. oh and um.. would you mind too much heading down before me to get any spots that might be left?. I feel like it'd be harder in the dark :P
or would that be a good idea?
okay cool :D. oh, should I, could I park at your housies?. sorry for all these questions
okay :D bye for now then!
I'll meet ya there :D. (: soo excited
(: seeing you yesterday just made my whole day better :D. And don't worry about iHop at all! I'd rather you get some sleep and feel better than be all tired and coldish. :D And I want to thank you bunches and bunches for putting up with me sleeping on your shoulder and on your arm (really really comfy) (: Because I know it must not have been very great being next to a sleeping me :P (I hope I don't snore or anything) . Sorry for the call by the way, you might be busy at school or something :D. Whoa, I can't believe I missed you by two minutes earlier. :D I'll talk to you later hopefully! :D for now, I'm gonna rearrange everything in my housie before my mom gets home and maybe plant a tree :D. (:. Whoa whoa whoa! :D oh um. hi. (: . Sorry :P. My mom just asked me if I can come in to help out with the field day at Kipps at 12o'clock, and she said that you could come help too if you wanted/were able to. :D So if you can, or would want to, feel free to call me on my home phone or something. :D It sounds fun. And maybe I will text you too if that's okay. :D. sorry :P. aw, my phone may have died a little. :P If you get an unreadable text, that means my screen was being funny :P. :D
:P okay- That's good. But it also means I couldn't find the send button without a screen. :3
Hi :D. Oh, I was wondering if I could call you?. :D Sorry, I just feel bad missing all your text-es partly because I can't get the screen to work. :3. But anywho, off to stuffs!  Part 3 of the Epic Cleaning Series: Today Leandra tackles the area behind the couch! What kind of mysteries and spiders lie behind the potato-area? Find out in today's episode at 9/10am central! . :P Sorry. Have an amazing day!!!! :D (:
teehee (: Your hair is all swoopy :D. sorry :D You're nice.
:D It's not nonsense; It's super true! :D. As true as blue is blue I'd say!. Oh I was hoping I could call you (whoa I was just about to put maybe, but then I realized...) . :P. I think I might, but just as long as it's not too much of a bother.. :D. I won't forget all the rocks! :D I hope they're of the perfect spinning thickness and whatnot.. :3
:D!! ooh ooh! I want to wish you a super amazing fantastic meeting with the Mayor!!!!!! It sounds really official. (: Have bunches and bunches of fun! :D
10 minutes sounds fun nonetheless :D (:
:D!
oh that's okay :D I was looking up information for that government thingy. And it's okay, I don't think the grounding in very serious, you know, since I've been grounded for about 5 weeks now :P
not when I got back it :P. in*. We went out to dinner and today we went out to lunch. and she said I can go tubing with you soon, or to the climbing gym :D
I already enforced my punishment by lying outside in a field yesterday :P. And I was trying to provoke bees and whatnot.. :P
It was okay, it was cool looking around :D. Trees are really detailed... sorry. I'm afraid you'll never ever speak to me ever ever again for forever
Because of when you were leaving to go across town.. I was hoping to um.. do that explosion thingy... :P
oh the little fist bump. and you know a lot of things- I'm just not so clear all the time :P
lol :P oh I get it! Whoa. I bet you were wearing the special cloak! :D
sorry :/. I'm too good at getting in trouble with my mom
I don't think you're a bad influence, I think you are simply an escape-goat because my mom can't bring herself to think of her daughter as being a terrible terrible person.. I thought I was doing the right thing though.. like.. You're supposed to bend the rules if it's for a good reason and being rebellious against unfairness is good?. :P
Or are children not supposed to bend their *parents* rules under any occasion? It's all a grey area. aw, maybe it was more silly than sweet, but thank you
:3. aw.. You're sweet.. :D. Or rather, that's sweet of you to think it was sweet? :P
I happen to think you are :D. I was just changing the wording so it fit better :P
not too important :D . What are you up to? :D
Oh, I'm just talking to you and trying to figure out what I'm going to be doing for the next week and what I need. :D
Aw, thank you. :D I hope so, too. I'm not sure what class type I should pick though-- could I get some advice from you? :D
yay :D. Activism in Art, Oral History of Veterans, Women In Government, Band, Chorus, Parliamentary Procedure, Basketball, Self Defense, Zumba, Public Speaking, Sustainability, Etiquette and Manners, Sign Language, and Rotating exercise (Spinning/circuit training, Vollyball, Yogalattes). here they are :P I get to pick one.
:D! Whoa. lol. I was going for either Self Defense, Zumba (fun? :D), Public Speaking, or Chorus (if it's for inexperienced people :P). And I think Manners are super useful--but I don't think it's anything they can teach or that I can't find elsewhere on my own. :D And the art and band one's do sound nice too!
I'm concerned that Band will require prior knowledge though (they told us to bring our own instrument if that's what we pick). :D ! I like what you were thinking. Whoa! and  "the resident Virginia State Troopers will also be leading running each morning at 6 am for anyone interested". That sounds cool too
hmm, maybe sign language
(: Then I can speak to gorillas.. communicate with*
:D Thank you. I think I'll miss adventuring though.
Maybe a sort of adventure, but really I'll miss adventuring with you.
My experience tells me otherwise (:
You can't apologize for your awesomeness- amazingness has a certain sort of inborn permanence to it. (:  it's definitely not something to be sorry for. (:
:P noo.. sorries aren't allowed.. sorry
It's okay, but I suppose it is around dinnertime now.. hmm, you're not still all home alone, are you?
aw :( That's not so fun.. Or maybe more fun. :P because you can eat a bunch of candy and jump on beds. and watch tv upside down like in the moview. movies*
hmm.. maybe lucky charms would work just as well? :D!
That doesn't describe you at all when I think of you, but I'm a little distracted looking at all stuffs to pack on here, so I was wondering if I might be able to call you?. :D
It'd just be a few words, mostly so I could hear your voice maybe?
:D! yay (:. see you on the phone lines :D. Oh hello! I'm sorry I missed your call--I was out for a pre-raincheck-Father's-Day. I hope I can speak to you soon though, because it could have been super duper important!. I'll be by a phone if you happen to read this at all. :D. I'll be by a phone if you happen to read this at all. :D
Aw.. I've been missing you a bunch, too. And don't worry--none of that sounds silly to me.  I like being around you, and a week without your niceness and radiance (yay!) has definitely left me feeling somehow homesick (is that the right word?).  I hope that tomorrow will bring the opportunity to see you and to hear everything I've missed that has been going on in your life! :D One week is a lot of time. And a catchy song, too. It was nice talking to you earlier by the way! :D Good night for now, and see you tomorrow! (for sure :3)
(: 'It's been, one week since something something...' It's going to be stuck in my head too! :P  I hope you slept well, too, because I have a feeling that some adventures are going to be happening today! :D  Oh um, would you like to adventure with me today? (: 
:D Yay for adventures!! (:. oh, and this is a young Mr. Lewis. :P. I just saw it randomly, and it was exciting because the wording was all exact. :D Maybe a lot of people say this phrase? :P
Hi!
:3 That face still reminds me of a walrus :D . You're super cool! (: And I'm making empanadas!
Don't worry, I can definitely save you one. (: Just make sure you have lots of bamboo handy. :3
Hi!!! :D lol don't ya know? Baboons and Pandas go together like peanut butter and jelly :D
Hmm.. probably not. :P  Yum ^-^ PB and J sounds awesome right now :D
(:!. Your tummy sounds like a polar bear
!!! :D I have one!! And it's for you! :P
Oh, I was saving it for you (:. :P I wish I made them better though
Yum!! :D !!. It's such a weird flavor, but it's awesome!. Oh, and it's super warm in Blacksburg (:
You should come experience all the warmness :P
Ah, maybe you're right, you'd only make about 3 hours of warm, but the warmness of your bed will never disappear! :P
Psh, what are the chances of that happening? :P
Beds get their warmth from the magic of the universe :D So until that runs out.. ^-^ Warm beds forever!
Aw, well I hope it's not cold if you do come to Blacksburg (:
Aw, really? :P Well, I would want you here so I could give you a poorly-made empanada :P
Whoa :D!! Yay (:. But what if it's just bad food on it's own :P
Haha, well thanks. :P Maybe if it's dipped in green salsa it could taste better. !*
But what if it's.. too too dry? I always would like to see you (: And!!! New Gravity Falls tonight!!
^-^!! If there's nothing else in Radford to do and if you were planning to come for the weekend anyway (:!!. Maybe you'll catch the sunshine in time (:. But you don't need to catch any sunshine, because you already have some all over your heart.. (:
Whoa :D (:!. That's cool! That's exciting ^^. Have a super safe drive over (:
:D! Ooh, I'll ask my mom if you can stop by (: We could play in the park :D!
(:!! You're really neat. I liked hearing about your earliest memories :D
!!! :D. (: Hi. !. I like you too (:
:P I ended up with your jacket somehow . No sorries for anything (:
I hope you have a nice day too.
Aw, I missed you too. I wanted to give you a great big hug :P. :P Maybe that's what my brain was thinking when I took it!
:P Yay (: That means I can get the stain out (. (:*. And don't be sorry at all (:. :3. I'm sorry for acting silly.. I have to work on that
I'll let you get to stuffs too :D Like studying for psychology (: I think you'll do really well! . I asked my mom about dinner, but she didn't seem to keen on it, so unless I finish alllll my works :P... I wish I were a faster worker..
Thanks Peter (:
Don't be sorry (:. Oh, and thank you for the suggestion :D I found some statistics about the number of deaths!
Good morning :D. !. Have a really really nice day, and stay dry and good luck on your psychology test! (:
:3 aw, I like your bedhead :P. I'm really really glad you're safe (:. Byebye ^-^ I hope your day is amazing too!
:P Oh hi. !
It's okay (:
I'm pretty good! My neighbors have a giant fire in their backyard, and that looks pretty cool! :D How are you?
:D!! You're right, they are! That's probably why they lit one :P
Getting to stuffs isn't quite as much fun as some things. :D
Okay, bye for now Peter! :v :P Have fun eating dinner or anything else!
Aw :3 How could you miss someone like me?. Well, I'll be here if you start to miss me (:. :P sorry for sounding silly.
Nobody's perfect, sillyhead :P. I miss you sometimes, too, though... More than sometimes, really.. sorry. Whoa! Thank you for the pastachio ice cream the other day!
Well there are a lot of someones out there, so thank you for choosing me. (:. It was so so so so tasty!. :D. like tasty sherbet. 
I've always thought so. :D Whoa, have you ever had those 'Flinstones" push pops?
!!! I have to get you one sometime. I haven't had one in a while, but if I remember right, they were really really good :D!! . They're made of super creamy orange sherbet (: yum.
Importance is just an opinion. Everyone has a different more important, and to me, I think you're the most important. . :3 
You're important to me. :3
Whoa, you listen to Lifehouse? :D
That's really cool! I've never heard that song before!
Well thank you for showing it to me :D
You haven't done anything wrong (:
Not at all :D I was just practicing some spanish. I think I might rehearse for my english presentation next
What are you up to? :D
Oh yeah :P Good call.. Secret stuff?! :D Sounds exciting
:P It could be anything! So it's definitely exciting. Be right back, I'm going to go get some paper and things for making my mobile :P
:D I'm excited to make it!
Just like your secret stuff (:
I won't be able to know for sure until I know what it is :P
You've said that before about amazinggggg! things :D
Okay! Have lots of fun with them (: But watch out, I hear that they escape easily.. You're anything but average
Not at all, unless the average is someone who's really nice and friendly and talented at just about everything. . (: 
:D Crazy, but true!
So true :D 
beep!. :D
!!!! Yay!!!! :D!! It's because you're magic, right?. Oh, you shouldn't miss me! I'm right here :D
You must be magic, because how else would you be able to make your voice all cool :D!. And how else do you explain that heart that shows up in those sandwiches? :D. It's magic!
If it were trickery, then there would be a mask to pull off somewhere :P. or a misplaced bunny :D
Hmm.. I might have to check next time just to be sure. :P . But I'd do it without you noticing!
I think so. :P But I'm not sure if I trust my ninja abilities.
Aw. :3 Well if there's that much trust put in me, then I better work on being ninja. :P. It's an art form, I hear.
Oh, I'm only cool when I'm outside in the cold. :P Otherwise, I'm pretty average.. Whoa!! Did you go outside today when it was morning?
Aw.. cold smiley face looks cool but sad. :P 
Do your hands get cold the mostest in the cold?
Aw :( I wish you weren't illegal.. I would petition to get you legalized :P. Mitten are good for your hands! Or kittens :P
I believe my grounding ends on Monday, so after that I'm free to float and be all happy! :D
I like floating with you :D
Movie night sounds fun! :D
Which ones do you not yet have that you want?. Maybe you'll have to get them in the blackmarket :P
Well the first one sounds important :D
Is it required that you take that one before the second one?
Ooh, and which ones did you get so far? :D. Sorry for questions
!!!!!!!!!! Whoa!! :D You're doing art history? :D!!
That's so cool! :D I wanted to do AP Art History, but it's not around at our school.
The Virtual Virginia classes filled up really quickly. It would've been neat though :D. I could probably still learn it!. :D It starts way back in Egypt... with the very first ever known artist... Imoheosdlfj something. I really hope you get those classes :D If your degree allows, I think you have qualifications to do a more advanced graphic class first-- I feel like the intro would be mostly review :3
You should get freshman privileges :D
Maybe it will work out :D Somehow. Maybe someone will realize that they clicked on "Graphic Design" instead of "Advanced Flute Whittling" 
:3 Be happys . You're so cool and I hope you get everything that you want. I bet they'll email you something nice (:
:3. You shouldn't miss me. I'm only a few miles away. I miss you too though :/ I want to watch movies with you ^-^ And play games
:D! I'd like to (:. I hope I get to see you on Monday (: Even though I have schools. I'm putting sweet potatoes in a pot :P
beep boop :D. Pokes
Sky-pe is a neat program :d. :D*. :d <- What does that look like? :P. Sorry :P Have a super nice dinner!
No sorrys :D (: You don't do anything wrong..
Yeah :D
:D That sounds really neat. or scary :p. I'd only play with you if it were thatt scary o.o. And I'd promise to keep my eyes open :P
But its not even Halloween! :P

Whoa, you're on break? :D. Really? :D cools
It would be very cool :D (:. Unfortunately, I've got to do some stuff before then, so I'd only get started at around 8ish perhaps :P. Oooh, I just went to the dentist!. Oh um, are you free to talk for a bit?
Whoa!! :D That's so cool!
:D. What are proportion papers?

I remember the book talking about his feet, but I think I will only make it down to his torso, that way I can keep it focused on his face LD. :D*. lol head measurements
sorry :P. My people normally end up looking like funny alien guys :D. (:

:P hehe, same thing. You're so crazy, but really cool and silly and amazing all at the same time. the good kind of crazy. Well right now I'm going to go exercises :P
Then I'm going to eat some dinner and tidy up the bathroom, and then I'm going to starts my project!
hehe :P You can come over and do exercises with me. That'd be silly though :p
Nah, that's okay :D
Whoa, my sister's home, I better get going!
:D!! I can see you, but exercising with me isn't so fun. And I'm almost done with the bathroom!
Yay! I finished!. Now for exercises? :P
Aw, thanks.. I think it'd be fun to do with you. We should go on a run on Wednesday morning in the earlys :D!. Hopeful isn't bad-- my break hasn't started quite yet though! :P. ^-^ But when it does.... Pumpkin pie.
You're so so much help, but I wouldn't ever want to stick you with something like cleaning a bathroom, unless we did it together :P
!! You're right!. But only with you
And non-toxic cleaning products :P. It'd be fun with you mostly
Why don't they make cleaning products that smell like candy? :P. Oh wait.. I know why.. :P
ah, I'm sorry. I don't want to attack anyone with word. s. only marshmallows :P. pew pew pew
or a banana lazer gun. aw, no. I like all your talks. You could never ever talk too much! ^-^. Bye for now. (:. I wonder what my Dorian Gray will look like. http://littlefanpages.com/47583 Another example of how easy it is to turn songs into food :P. Ooh, are you safe in Radford already? (: !!! This is what I'll be filling out for college for the next 4-5 months. :P ! (: . I like this picture lots! :D I can find a more current one though :P 
:D That looks really cool! We should make one :P 
Whoa, this is so cool!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbF6m3BeGUQ . hehe, whoops, sorry. I think I missed you that last time . But yeah, the liquid latex looks really cool! 
What? :P No way. Well it is pretty informative and everything :D! 
You're so so so awesome! :D Ahh, there are scary pictures showing up in my sidebar :P 
Sorry, I took your phone and forgot to give it back. . I'm holding it hostage for now, but I can deliver it in the morning! :D. It was silly, I tried to send you a text message. I mostly wanted to say sweet dreams. :3 So, sweet dreams, Peter! I like you so so so much! . Good morning! :D Aw, just kidding.. my mom is not okay with me dropping it off for some reason. But in the meantime, I have your phone. . Whoa, that truth thing is still there :P
That's okay :P I kind of put it in a not so noticeable place.
Oh yeah :P I thought that once too, when I saw it was done charging. . I should've done something.. My mom suggested you could pick it up on your way to the appointment, but I didn't think that would be very convenient for you.. Maybe I can bike it to you :P
Okay. Aw.. Well I'll miss you. :3. :P That's why I wanted to deliver it to you.. And because it's yours.
Maybe I'll throw in some candy too.
Aw ^_^ 
I'm yours too. 
And okay :D! I hope your teeth feel better!. Okay :P I like your bedhead. Byebye for now!
I liked that too :P It's so cool! Like Quantum Leap!. I think it needs a catchy theme song though. 
Bye! :D Have lots of fun! . The onion volcano is soooo coool!!!!!!!!! 
!!! :P !! Yeah, you could totally borrow my circular saw :D!!! I'm not entirely sure how to use it yet though, so hopefully you have a good idea already :P. Ahhh, 'truth' keeps coming back :P 
:P Ahhh! You scared me too :P   Yay! I'd like that (: 
Good morning! Aw, I just had a dream about you and it was nice and I hope I'll get to see you today! ^-^
:D! Dreams are cool! I like playing runescape with you in the dungeons and building huge snow forts (you're really good at that!) and wearing hats and sledding even if it's not very fast and throwing snowballs and surprising giant snowball at you :D!  I like caramel hot cocoa and soup and halo and sliders too! :D And most of all, I like being with you and I like you.   You're nice. Sweet dreams!
You're so cool! :3
Yay! . I like that you're here too!
Aw :3 Can we do that?
mmm and with soup!. :P
but of course :3
nah, I've had enough soup I think, but I better let you get to sleep :D
sussstaneceness :P. Aww, sleep is nice. even if it's missing something or someone
:D! yay cat! You're fluffier though! :D
:3!. That's nice. I can't wait! :D. :3
And then the cat will be super warm for cold feet :P
Goodnight to you too! I had such a nice day today :3. Sweet dreams too :3. Byebye (:
and ttfn
*throws snowball*. rawr. :P. sorry
*rubs off the snow*
:P. Byebye!
Good morning! :D!! Yay! There's still lots of snow outside! I miss you, and you're really cool!
Because I haven't seen you in awhile :D 
Yesterday seems like so long ago though. :D Aw, thank you for tucking me in! It was really nice of you. And when you were walking down, I was wishing I had helped you carry down the sleds. I hope you got home safely! :D Good morning!. Dungeoneering! :P Maybe I'll practice killing zambies so I can impress you later :D! . I go shower really fast first :P . I'll* . It's hard to shower quickly when the water is so warm. :3 I hope your dreams are nice :D 
Rawr! 
I love you, Peter! :D . you're cute (: 
I think you're so so cute! :3 Bye for now! 
Psst.. Do you need me to call you and wake you up again? :P . You're so so cool too! 
!!! Dragons are so so so cool!
I love you :D
Whoa!! Is that one of the videos? . Did we miss that one somehow?. You gotta come back so we can watch it! :D
Yeah! :D Even if it's just one of those kiddie quarter rides!. That'd be cool! :P. I love you so so so much and I'm glad you're home safe :3 
:3 I liked talking to you and just sitting with you a lot. And of course the pug videos :P
Sweet dreams for now and sleep well :D I hope your brother gets some sleep too.
That's okay! You made it better. :3 You're good at cheering me up. How'd you know I like tacos? :P
Goodnight (: 
mmm tacos :3 . See ya, Ace! :D. The $40 seems like the best price for the newest edition, especially if it's from your local bookstore--it was comparable to the amazon rental price which was only a few dollars less.  Also, an older edition that is likely to have similar material is only $24 to buy used, but you'd have to ask your professor if it's okay to use with the course, but he might not be too keen on such a late asking. So, your best option with less hassle is probably just the rental price they gave. :P Just thought I'd check to make sure though. Night night! . I like you. . Rawrs :D! I don't know if you'd want me to call you to wake you up, but maybe if I did, 10am would be a safe time. :P I like your videos a lot.
I'm not tired of seeing you :3. But I'm silly. Are you feeling lucky? :P http://www.papajohnscointoss.com/#register
mmm this food is so good :D!. rawr!
Hi! :D Are you packin up?
Good luck with it! :D Oh, I've forgotten to return the plaid shirt and pajama pants and shorts! . Maybe when I catch you next weekend I can :D
I'd say 6:30pm but it depends on the rest of your schedule :D. Whoa! You got business calc? :D Awesome!. Sorry, I should've offered to let you sign up for classes here
It slipped my mind some how. oh whoops :P. I read that wrong. Which days of the week is it?
That sounds like not too many days. Is that the only slot? . I'd be worried about you having to walk all in the dark and cold--but otherwise it seems okay :D. Would you still make it to club?
Aw, no Chinese club? :(. And okay :D That sounds like a cool plan.
*poke*. They have that one? :D!
Awesome! :D I hope you get that one. I like morning classes
Night is when I get all sleepy and cuddly :3
And not calculus-y... despite my looking up a calculus video not long ago.  . Aw :P well, I always like cuddling you.. mmm, I ate more food and now my headaches all gone! :D. yay!
Does that mean I'm not sick? :D. yay!!
I was afraid I would miss school. :D
:P Nah, that's never a good thing--unless you really do need to study. :P. I'll study in the extra hour we get :D. Mmm. This spam is made of turkey!
I do agree that Graphics would be more beneficial to you than silly ol' calculus :D I bet you already know most of the calculus. I hope everything will work out ^-^
Yay :D
I can imagine your eyes getting bigger when you're looking out :P
:3 Aw, okay! Good luck packing! And thank you for the most wonderful kind of day! :D
I hope you get sleep, it's good and you'll be all relaxed :D
Oh yay! :D. I like your clothes
I wish I could cuddle more with you :3
I love you :D. Byebye for now!
Ttfn, and good luck tomorrow! :D
Should I call you?
You're so so amazing!
yeah, after school perhaps? or really really early?. Sorry
I like talking to you :D. Whoa, really? :D
Okay ^_^. Cool! I'll talk to you tomorrow then! :D. Have fun with Jack on your feet, perhaps! . Night night. :3 You're perfect everywhere
Sweet dreams, Peter ^_^
boop :D!
Oh no, sorry! I disappeared :P . But not before I booped you :D 
Aw :D That's really really nice :D! I'll scan them right now!  . lol :P I like how you get to keep your eyes open while you yawn :D >O< . mmm I'm eating an egg with cheese because it tastes extra nice that way!
Everyone needs sustenance! I would go grocery shopping with you :3 
I don't think I've ever fasted before 
Aw.. I'd give you my egg and cheese! I have more!
Aw, but I could always use my teleporting powers!
I wish I had teleporting powers... Maybe I could just tag along with teleporting bunny. Or teleporting fat guy.. But he scares me a little :P
More hot pockets? :P. I want you to have lots and lots of food.. Maybe santa will bring you some and it will be restocked in your pantry! :D. :3 You're cute. And so is your tummy :P. I'm picking up my phone tomorrow! :D. Someone found it
I'm not sure :P But they must be pretty awesome for wasting they're time to return a phone!. hehe hat packet. I'm not sure when they found it. But they texted about it to Vasilike yesterday. So I bet that's when
Yeah! Especially since the snow would've uncovered it!
Perhpas :D. perhaps* :P. I said the first one out loud and it sounds cooler than perhaps :P
Yay :D!. I'm gonna scan some photos :P Maybe I'll include extras just in case, but you can pick out the ones you one to use/ones that fit! :D
Aw :3 I'm here too :D
but what am I? :P
:P no, You're cute :3. should I email them or facebook them?
Okay :D
:P That's silly. I'm not cool. :P. But you are :D! I bet there's an email somewhere that tells you that :D
:P Noo... Smashing!
Aw, why is the last one sad?
aw :( . I mostly wanted you to get to see the watermelon one :P
Ahh, there are too many pictures :P. I'm not sure which ones to put in. maybe I can just send them all and you can pick? :P
Yay :D! I like your choices a lot
You're perfect ^_^
I think you're wonderful :3 In every way
I think you are though, and maybe that counts for something (:
the coolest ones are the ones with you (:. Is it silly that I miss you already? It happens too much. And is it even sillier that I think that means something? 
Aw, I should let you get to go sleep so your tummy isn't so rumbly! :D. No, you're silly! *push* :P
Noo, you're silly! *pushes harder* :P
*randomly falls out of chair*. Wait! I was just looking for a skittle that I dropped!. :P. I'm okay.
Candy is good. :D Sharing it with you is fun!. Oh yeah :P whoops. But I would've felt terrible afterwards 
yay :D! *punch* . You're cute ^-^
Aw, I better go study for my chemistry test--it's getting a little late
You're cute! :D You even have a cute little walrus face to go with your cuteness!
:D Sweet dreams to you too! I liked that one time when I got to see you fall asleep on skype :3. Stay warm in the morning!
Once my room's all clean :D!. (: . I'd like to do that then (:
:P Unless...! I finish :D!. Byebye for now (: I think rather highly of you, Peter! 
I can always hold off if you like though and we can do the finishing touches together! :D . Would you want to paint with me? :P
Yay! :D We might get dizzy if we stay in the closet too long though
And okay :D! I like talking to you (: And I like you!. Byebye! Phhhh*explosion*!
*fist bump explosion!*
Yay! :D Now I can say goodbye with a clearer heart :P
(: Bye! *punch*. Just kidding! It was really a hug in disguise (:
:3 Ttfn. Yay! :D
Have oodles of sleeps! (: Bye!
:P I got you! :D!!! 
You got me too (: 
Rawr :D!
Hi there :D
I'm good :D I'm doing work out stuffs, and I realize how embarrassing it might be if you were here. :P But I still wish you could be here anyway. How are you?
You'd really want to? :P!
Well we'll just have to schedule that for another day then! "D. hmm 239-7351. Who's that?
Me either :P. Could be :D. Well, I'm gonna go finish the rest and then I'll have some time to shower :D!
:P hehe that would just be wayy too much to handle
You're so so cute. :3 But you might be in trouble if I grant that wish. :P I've never shown a bedhead/workout head combo to anyone. It could be deadly.
:P Whoa. Protein.. I'll just have to eat a bunch when you get here!. :P hehe only one cup of water. but maybe I should be drinking more... It sounds like fun to workout with you.. Maybe I should save you the last 20 minutes or so :P
Okay :D!. psst.. would you want to do some of it at 1 when you come over?. or is it too silly?
We can eat omme-lettes and spinach :D!
and drink lots of water. Only if it's what you want to.. Unless you're not man enough.. :P. Yeah, I went there.
Because it's too easy for you?. Oh, I see how it is.. :P
hehe, that's what I thought, but I'm teasing you.. :3 Didja get enough sleep yesterday?
Aw. 
So you got to sleep extra? :D
Whoa.. That's crazy.. Well then, we should just work out together another day. :P. I'll finish your half too :d. :D *. :P Just kidding. I'll stop picking on you.. Rawr!
Aw ^-^. :P Hehe, well see you for now.. But if you change your mind.. you know what my phone number is.
So I see.. I've said to much. I'll leave you with that.. (poof)
nuh-uh. :P Byebye!. I'll see you at 1 o'clock?. But you better be ready for action.!. Cookie-making action!. byebye for now!
Yeah! If you can handle it!. (: Byebye
! :D Just identified what awesome birds were in my backyard. I think it's my favorite type of bird because of it's tuft of feathers on its head and because it's bird call is really nice. :P Sorry, it's silly. I'm totally going to call you to see if you need any help with your art history thingy! :3 
Hi :D!. Sorry :P I was on earlier to scan in some files to send to my friend
Rawr!. The split pea soup is taking a long time to cook! . I think that's why it's called a slow cooker :P. But it smells all nice. As if to taunt me :P. into eating raw potatoes
mmm :3. ooh, I know!. I'll eat an egg and some kale and some veggies from yesterday! :D
!! nugget in a bread!. That sounds pretty awesome! :D
hehe, aight! :D
You're amazing (:. But you can be aight too, if that's what all the cool kids are these days. I'm going to do some....dun dun... government homework!
!!! :D Whoa! How did it become strawberry?!. That's so cool!
Awesome!. All I have is chocolate and vanilla :p. Ooh, the president's project is soon!
:P Oh that's alright! Do we need many pictures for the project? . I'm not sure which president to do... I like Teddy Roosevelt lots, but mine couldn't compare to yours :P
I like the things that Lyndon B. Johnson did, but I hear he wasn't all that successful. So many Eisenhower would be cool
hehe, that's okay-- that might make it tougher if your dad knows him better. :D Aw.. It would be cool!. Whoa, jeopardy is on now!
:D Your dad might get suspicious though!. It's very nice though (:
:P Are you one of my sources? (:
You're rather nice but I'll try to do it mostly all myself! :D
I like your help a lot but I'm not sure how the teacher would feel about it. :P. But you'd probably know better than I would :P
Maybe you're right if it doesn't have to be our own work. :D In any case, I would enjoy working on it with you (:
It would be :D!. So, any ideas on which president!
!! He sounds cool! Who's that? :P. Just kidding.. He does seem like a robot a bit. With all his cool dance moves, I mean.. :D
Oh! Or maybe it's because he didn't smile often!. :D. Yeah, that.
He's a man of steel!. I always knew it :P
That's a cool word :D
Awww.. :3. Hey! You did that thingy again :P. You tricked me1. !*. :P. sort of
I like you too ^~^ and I think you're a very cool word!
I must amaze only in all my silliness :P
(: You amaze me. With all your niceness and talent and sparkley-ness and all the projects you do.. I'm not sure that I can right now--I have to go online to attend a "webinar" shortly. Maybe afterwards? :D
Yay! :D. Can you ever get tired of candy canes?
Sugar rushes can be dangerous sometimes.
How about chocolate? 
(: Chocolate is nice.. I think as long as I have milk, it's difficult to get tired of!. and a creamy chocolatey filling is a plus! :P
Ooh, thank you for the thin mints today! :D They were awesome!
They reminded me of my childhood :P
You're really neat! :D (: . I've never attended a webinar before, but this ones coming up in a few minutes :P
Thanks :D Hopefully I won't have to use the webcam--I'm all in pajamas :P
:P . jammies are nice.. Aww, I gotta go, so byebye for now!. :D. I think it ends around 10pm. Ttfn!. It's a chatroom :P. those are full of awkward silences.
Oh did I? :P
:P Whoops. I apologize for any awkward silences that we might incur. 
Yay! :3 If we ever have any awkward silences in person, it's probably because I'm admiring your amazingness ^_^
:P hehe I thought crazt was a slang word like aight
You're wonderful (:. I hope participation in the chatroom increases soon :P . One of the admissions deans used a smiley face, so I will assume that etiquette is okay! :D
:3 Aw.. That makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.. (:. And happy and smiley outside. I do believe that you're the greatest boy I've ever known (:
Aw, I'm a frayed knot. . The chat still looms :P In a good way though.
Hi! :D. boop!. The chat branched off to Facebook :P. But I think it's about over. It's definitely getting me excited about UVA :P. Everyone has such nice things to say about their school!
Yeah! :D It's so cool, it's making me sleepy. ^_^. :P
skyping would be soo cool! Are you all comfy and going to sleep yet?
:D
(: Any way you are is fine! I think I'll get upstairs after answering this email thingy
Oh nos, it's a long email, so perhaps I'll respond in the morning :P. I'm all sleepyhead, so I'll brush my teeth and everything first just in case :P. byebye for now while I switch computers and everything
I like you :3
(: We fixed a wii!
Yes :D That's percisely what I meant! Get this.. I still have your pencil! :P I'm sorry.
I meant to get it after we came back from eats :P But I think I lack focus sometimes.. Especially when you're around (:. I'll just have to duct tape it to my hand, that way it'll be sure to get to you!
I like you so much too! :D!!. Sorry for being a little slow there :P. You're so so fun to be around too! :D I liked getting to do homework with you, because it didn't feel like work (:. I like you ^-^
You're so so amazing (:
Nope, you're the best (:. I'm going to do some laundry maybe!. Or physics homework!. Or both! :D. How about yourself?
Or make super amazing armatures! :D (: You have lots of fun too! :D. Byebye, Peter!
Don't forget to pet a cat for me :P. I'm a polar bear!
You're cute. (:
:P Nah.. Yay! Physics time!
Not as fun as adventure time, but still cool!
Aw okay :P It'd be too much physics in one conversation if you did I'm guessing :P
Neat :D And our computers didn't explode, so I guess it's okay :P
I like you so much too. :D hmm, when you were talking about background playgrounds earlier... . Would they be for us to play on, too? :D. :P
^-^ That's cute.
Hey... :P
I like you too! :D and okay, I better let you get to doing things too! :D byebye for now!
I bet it will! :D It looks really nice as it is (:. I wish i had watched more instead of reading. At one point he was all string, and before I knew it... green foam!. :P. Byebye! (: Sweet dreams for now if I don't get to tell you later.
:D! Have a super awesome day! Brr.. it's chilly out there so I'm sending some of my polar bear powers your way :P. You're welcome.. :P 
(: I hope your physics lab is going super funly!
I'm safe :D . (: Thank you for being so awesome!
I'm officially scared of the night :P
too many scary movies at once :P. I'm okay though! 
Yeah! :P
I was so scared the same guy would be there, so I went a different way!
Sometimes a recognizable car is not good.. I'll be so so scared :P. Or maybe I'll have built up a tolerance!. Yeah!. Let's aim for that!
That sounds nice too (:
Thank you so much :D Watching Supernatural was fun!
You're so so amazing!
I like you too (:
Sweet dreams, Peter!. Aww, that's a cute face. it's like a horse :2. My horse!

Rawr :D! 
Hi! :D. Sorry, I totally was putting stuff in a washing machine :P
Aw :( I'll be your epoxy putty for you!
That's good :D . Whoa, I thought that only happens with glasses! . That's so crazy :3 Silly Peter.
:P My hand is like a floor too. ^-^
:3 . I think you're cute.
How can I be cuter than you? :3 You're so so adorable.
But honest (:
^-^ Getting to see you is super nice! I hope tomorrow works out
I'm scared o.o. Will you test out this story for me and tell me if its okay to read? http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/detail.nhn?titleId=350217&no=31
is it okay?
o.o. Even after the first part?. I stopped at the creepy picture.
o.o Can I read it when I'm with you?
Yay! :D Okay!
Awesome! Have lots of fun!. Byebye for now!. If you read this... Do you have any nice quotes that would fit the theme of graduation? And do you possibly have a copy of last years poster that you made for the art show saved? :3 Sorry to trouble you
There's none yet, so I was wondering if you had any ideas :D. I meant in the last message that the theme of the quote should relate to us graduating :P. I like a lot of the Winnie the Pooh ones!
I like that. :P. I would love to be able to say that at the podium :p
I'm pretty sure there's a section for quotes :D. So thanks :D
That's alright! :D Have fun with supernatural!
That's good :D Sleep is nice
Turning the tables on me again, huh? :P. (:. What is your favorite song at the moment?
It sounds good (:. The music video is funny too :P. I bet your dad could do that with all his ties.
I'm not sure how to start this poster :P
I will hopefully think of something :P. Maybe i"ll just use an internet picture!
Just some words about the art show and then a picture. It's not too bad. :D I'm almost done with my poem
(: Well thank you. That's rather nice.. Would you like to hear the poem so far? :P
Here, beneath the earth and further still, lies one king, misled Where in practice, nobility, did weave a tangled web. A single stain will tarnish, as power doth corrupt And charm can dually cloud the mind and nullify distrust. This pied piper persuaded plenty after his act of treason And caused chaos to pervade and turn the state of Denmark rotten. These wrongdoings prayer had not the strength to vindicate. And no mask of words nor guilt sincere could rightly exculpate. 
Aw :D You like it?!! Yay (:. I was putting on my Shakespeare.
It's like putting on the Ritz, just with less crackers
(: Yay. I have some in my pantry I think!. How did the epoxy putty go? :D
Did it get made into amazing?
Yeah! That would be cool!
You're nice (:. I'm on the last line!
Yeah!
Happy half birthday, Peter!!. I'll head off to school now :P And I'll pick you up at about 11:45 if that's alright :D
boop boop :D. ^-^
Hey, that guy doesn't look like you :P. But he's using Gauss's Law that we used in physics, so I give him props.. :P
:D. Rawr
You know how Four o'clock is a good cleaning time? Well, what is a good closet fixing time then?. Whoa, really/ :d. That's so cool!!!

Yes! That's exactly what I'm looking for!
Hehe :D I could always try my hand at that.. It'll be tough without help this time though.
:D!! Whoa, really?
Maybe.. if I get to go on Wednesday... I could bring a bunch of cake making stuff and we could make it after your exam? :P. Or maybe that would be too crazy
Aw, but what about all your study time?

om nom nom
Whoa! :D!! :P Did you accidentally put any random integral signs in it? :P. I would like to read it :D But not before all the middle chapters

Boop boop de doop :D. Just got back from eating at Applebee's.. That place has really awesome food!. And the waiter person gave us an extra brownie as a treat! :D. yummmy.. ^-^
Whoa!! :D I bet he knows the guy who gave us more brownies. :D Om nom nom.. Aw.. :P Nah. Then you would be getting brownies like 24/7. Yay (: Brownie Points from you are the best!
Aw... You should get all the brownies ever!! :D But not allllllll of them, because brownies are like happiness sometimes, and other people need to be happy too.
You should get all the brownies (:

I've never met a toast I didn't eat.

It's like.. "I'm your favorite nephew!" When in reality, he's the only nephew!
Aw, that's nice of you :D
Wow, I didn't realize that pokemon of the past was so detailed :P
Communication is key.
So you can start building your empire of cuteness? ^-^
Sounds appropriate for such a cute guy.
(:
Sorry
:P It is strange that the scary pokemon is a girl rather than the cute ones. . Togepi has always been underestimated! I always liked when he would wave his hands and make cool things happen though! :D
 :D Didja know...  Woodland creatures are awesome and hanging ten. 
(: Hehe, slowpoke surfing is fun to imagine. I like his expression. Or lack of. :D This is making me miss the T.V. Series.. Anywho, I should go jump in bed soon :D

That's okay. I'm sorry I wasn't there to answer.. How is the homework going?
:D! That sounds like fun! (: If only it were an escalator, that way you could just run in place up stairs! :D. (: They should rent out the mall as a gym on Mondays.
:D! If we're ever in a mall.. I would like to try running up an escalator.. I think I've only done it once; on the Baltimore trip. Or maybe it was the D.C. one :P. Either or.
D.C. I think!
Yay :D! Life dreams!. You should do some homework :D That's what I'm going to do (:
So that means it must be the cool thing to do.. Bandwagon.
:P. Aw (: Thank you.. Good luck to you too! ^-^
o.o That's true.. (just kidding about me being cool by the way. :p). Bandwagon is bad. So do homework for the good for the good of it :D. And because you know you want to.
:D! . Who? Me? Couldn't be.. (: Must be you!. Time for dinner for me :D Then homeworks!. (:

Aw, that's okay :P . Whoops
I wish I was close enough to give you the one sitting on my coffee table. . But glue sticks aren't to tough to find! I bet there are some in the art rooms!
Aw. I like that the art rooms in high school are all well stocked :D. I'm sorry about the glue stick thing... If you have any change, you could make a shopping trip?. :D
Do you have your bike over there?
Aw. Well then I suppose it just depends on how much you need a glue stick :p. Would paper mache stuff work?. out of flour and water?
hehe
Then I suggest you go drive and get it (: If you think it's worth it. But the wood glue might work?
I think... If you look deep inside yourself, then your heart will tell you what to do.
I'm sorry :P I was trying to make you laugh... But I think, if you need a glue stick, you should go buy one. :D Just make sure no one catches the date on your windshield.
You're not lame at all ^-^ I wish I could help more than giving advice.
Okay, that sounds good too :D . And you're awesome!. "Taylor Office and Art Supply" is only about 5 blocks away from you
That's about a 4 minute walk
Taylor Office & Art Supply Inc, 118 3rd Avenue, Radford, VA 24141. I'm not sure what the hour's are though, so you should call. And ask if they have glue sticks :D. (540) 639-9695 . hours*
Green Heron Local Gifts & Artsmore info 111 3rd Avenue Radford, VA 24141 (540) 633-2787. This one is close too. Ah sorry, I'm not sure if that one sells supplies, they might just mean artwork
My next suggestion would be to ask neighbors. But that could be dangerous :P
College kids seem easy to approach and would be awake at this hour.. And would hopefully have some glue :p. Ah, I'm sorry.. My suggestions aren't so good.
Aw okay.. The university bookstore would be open this late if you're willing to walk!. :3. At least, I think it would be
I'm sorry
That's okay :D . Well, CVS is the closest store store
I can't remember if they close at 9 or 10 though, so it may be good to check
Yay!. I hope they have glue :P
Cool! :D That would be neat! and there could always be a bookstore trip in the morning? :P . Good luck with it all! I'm sorry I could be of more help
You're the coolest! ^-^ I just wish I could be cool too and help you more.
You're not the least bit :3. But it does sound like you have a lot to get to, so I should not be a bother.. Sweet dreams for now (:
hehe :P If you like
:D. And I'd get to help!. (:. help you stay on task at least!
Seeing you is the best. :D

Hey nowww.. this is what dreams are made of!

It could've been me then too :P Perhaps perhaps
Only the internet.
Humbum
:P noo, I'm talking about humbums :P. It's totally different, Peter! :P
hehe :P That's okay.. You didn't offend me (: I think I meant, humbug, but humbum seemed to rhyme better!
Yay!
(: Yay!. again.. :P I have only an hour or so more to study!
Yeah!
Nah, but learning physics is!. And so are you! (:
That's the one that I agree the most with! (:. And if not that, then I could give you solid proof for how sweet and funny you are. :3
(:. That means that I get to prove it to you? :D

Aw, I wish I could've been there to wake me up :3 I think you saved me this morning . You're the best! 
You're amazing and so so nice ^-^ Why would you want to help someone like me? 
(: I'm nowhere near perfect, but you're like sunshine and rainbows and awesome ^-^ I like you too!

You're so so great, but I must say adieu for now . ^-^. That means goodbye. :P. But you know that.
Whoa, you finished? :D!!!
That's really nice ^-^
(: You're a really awesome teacher, Peter, so I'd like to take you up on that offer. :P Would you be free next week at all?

It is?. I'm sorry
You're the very best and I love you so so much!
:3 You're so so nice, and I was hoping to get to go to church with you tomorrow
(: Okay :D That'd be very nice
Nah :3 But that's one of your best qualities
I have caprisun! . But you might want to substitute water for now :P
Thank you for making me smile all the time :3
:D You do make me smile
:D Aw, you have a plan for that? :3
That almost sounds like a poem ^-^. Sorry for the slowness, I was just moving my computer upstairs!
I wish you didn't have to ever feel sorry :3 Especially not for yourself. You're one of the best people I know, if not the best. And I don't want you to be anything but yourself.
You is the best! (: I pick you.. I choose you, Peter Mattox! :3
:P  Good job, Peter Mattox! You show that Magicarp who's the better splasher!
Really? :D! I'm not sure if I've ever caught one before!
(Be right back, I'm going to go brush my teeth in a second)
:D I hope I get to learn the powers of the goldeen soon.. Really, horn attack?. !! 
:D. I think so too.. Are you up to anything at the moment?
No, I'm just all ready for sleeps :3
Hi :D! hehe, I have bad timing, I was just about to jump in the shower. And I don't just say that as a figure of speech. There will definitely be some jumping going on
:D! That would be super cool!. And no, nothing special is required!. Would you really want to? (:
That's so so crazy (:. I can lend my expertise in dishwashing when I go to pick you up! :D
Well okay.. :P. I better go get clean (:. I'll be fast!. And my phone is open for texts!. :D Byebye for now!

hehe, thanks :3 Are you going on skype tonight?
It would be nice to see you some more :3 But that's alright if not. You must be tired of me by now.
:D! Cool!. I'm going to go do all those things i said I would then!. And stat :P. Byebye for now!
pst.. If you're still awake.. You should wash your arm in cold water.. The one that you put the ivy on.. Because it's looking like it might be poison ivy. Like, without a doubt.. Perhaps.. I'll try and get on skype to alert you too! ;D. :D*. There could still be hope for us.

Hi :P Hehe, I thought that sound came from skype!

Whoa! What's the thingy?
You click "Network". And then "Join existing network". Aw, that sounds nice (:. Yay! You're there (:
That's you right?
Then you go to minecraft and do.. "add new server". And the Server Name is: PitaBread. and the IP is 25.22.26.110. And then I have to open the server. and go on minecraft too :P
Oka, the server should be ready :D. Okay*

Whoa, okay :D I'll go back then1. !*
/op JustSomePita :3. That fixed it!. Yay
You're so cool!. What are you up to today?
That would be nice :3. Would you like to come to the high school with me when I go?

Hi!
How are you? (:
I'm doing well (: Still cleaning my room right now!
!! :D No way!. That's so cool!
Aww :3 . No way :3 It sounds so *phone rings*
Oh, it sounds cool! :3. and exciting!. Are they tiny villagers,like pygmys?
Aw ^_^
It would :3
What kind of houses? :D Tall ones, small ones, wide ones? Ones out of glass that we couldn't throw rocks at?
I wish I could do exercise with you, it's more fun!
(: I'm going right now, if you'd want to join me :D . Ooh, I can go to the mural thing!
I told them I have a mural thing :D
It's not? :/
Well I'd rather not--I'd want to spend time with you :3. I trust your advice, too though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=EeP_AKNaIX4#! embrace the happy ^_^. Well I don't want to be successful if it means that. I want this to be a somewhat on the side thing-- and I'm staying back for a week or so to see how some of it plays out for people. . Would I be able to catch a ride with you to the murals?
Okay :D I'll be ready for then. I'm going to go do morning stretches if you'd like to join me ^-^
You're perfect company :3. Oh, my mom's not home
We could go in the park, if you'd rather!. Also
:3 You wouldn't be in the way. I can even call my mom to check!
:D Yay you can come!
She suggested you ride my bike back
Yay! Don't forget the helmet!
I still have bed head too!. Bye for now! (:

boop boop de doop!. Hi! :3. Hi!. Jel-lay Bean
(:
! Dive right in, right?
I like the Bear n' Bear idea bunches! (: The name could change if you like though, and I like being a Polar Bear.. I also like the idea of the different islands.. But maybe there are other adventures than just the islands.
Choco-volcano!
hehe, it seems like hacks have stretched past just being on computers.
I found the bacon pancakes!
Yeah!. Did you find the bacon pancakes, too?
They're real, Peter!!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxELm6xdwXk. I'm guessing you've already seen this?
That's crazy!. I must've missed it!. You must've played the one with the cooking happening? . O.o!
:D! I remember that time!. While playing clue?. Monopoly*. We should make some bacon pancakes so we can sing the song!. I got bit by a llama :P
It could be!. If it is, it's not very popular.
We could change that! :P . hehe, Good night and sweet dreams to you too (:. I think lake might be on Friday, instead.. Would you like to go with me to visit the dogs at 2:00pm tomorrow?
Yay! Okay!. What time should I swing by to pick you up tomorrow?
Okay :D How is 1:20?
:D! Alright, 1:20 then.
:D. I'm near and far!. You're awesome (:. Night night.
night night night (:
It was the best (:. ^_^. Sorry, too.
Did you like it?
You can't say sorry for making me feel all warm and nice inside.. It was the best sleep I've had in ever.
It may have been the combination of super sleepy, and a very nice person to be with :3
You're wonderful :S. :1
:2/
Goodnight to you too!. Byebye!
mmmm :3  
That looks awesome! . I'm not sure why I decided to take these at such an hour. :P But this is what I look like today.. I am the sillys :P Good night, good knight.
Whoa, really? :D I always assumed it was made by something like this (blushing) . Swagcode! PlanningAhead worth 10 
Yay (: . I'm going to go downstairs and use a giant wrench to fix the outdoor faucet! Hopefully.
(: It does :P Is there any weeding that still needs to be done for today?
Alrighty (: . Happy 6 months till' Christmas!. Hey, is Scott somewhere nearby you, by chance?
That's alright :D . I was just having trouble finding the shut-off valve so I could start working on the faucet. Maybe I'll ask him next time I see him. The internet doesn't do much when there are so many different possible locations :P. :D Anywho, I'll leave soon to pick you up. Maybe 1:30 would be a good time so I can start cleaning out my car?
That's okay. :D It was a pretty awesome sandwich!
mmmm nutella
:P But the real matter at hand is: Would I make a good sandwich?
hehe, whoops :P I forgot about that double meaning.. But thank you, I'm quite flattered that you like my sandwiches :J
Oh, I totally might have left my phone downstairs.
Cool! I'll go get it and look!
Oh cool! You painted it black?
It looks quite nice! :D
Whenever anything takes me lotsuv time, I try to be proud of it :3
I'm proud of you too (:. I like you.. If you'll excuse me, it's time to go help my mom with groceries, because I just heard her cer!. car*. hehe, her cer sounds like some accent.
:P Hehe.. I'm just heeding ovah to see the doctah.. Whoops, I think I changed it to a different accent. :P. So, progress report: I am missing you to death.
That's okay :3. And I would love to!
Well I cordially accept.. Should I sign somewhere?
Then I shall sign next we meet.. Second progress report: I have enough pairs of undergarments to last for 5 weeks.. Sorry, I should really be keeping these things to myself.. :P
Plus it's girl underwear, so all of it only takes up enough room to fill a shoebox :P 
Sorry :P So um.. nothing new, but I like puppies. . My mom bought biscuits and sweet potatoes and bananas and avocado and everything nice!
Yeah! Now all I need is chicken! But I think I have some of that too.. All I need is good company :3
(: Did the word "mediocre" recently gain a new meaning?
Then mediocre wouldn't be the right word at all for your company (:
Well, you're nothing but average. :3
Aw man.  I don't know why everyone is complaining about geese, when typos are the true bad guys.. you're nothing like average*
That's okay :P It was that evil fiend, Mr. Typo.. (: Anywho, I am going downstairs to finish up those thank you cards and watch something my mom wants to see.
Thanks :D! I hope your night is lots of fun too. I mean.. Have the night you're going to have! :3. Watch out for that last swag-code! :P
Hi! . Have you been watching the Texas filibuster? :P 
I just started, I think she's been going for 10 hours so far though, but it's been on break. I thought it might be interesting to see one in action. 
Yeah! :D Her name is Wendy. And it's about abortion. These are the two things I know so far. 
Yes :P This is the stream, but I'm not sure when she will continue talking. 
It seems important and I've never seen one before. :D I'm not sure how often such lengthy ones occur.. But sleep is a nice thing to do, too.. (:
Sheep are good :3. Just curious, what is your stance on abortion?
Well now, that just sounds like an abuse of the whole thing. I've found agreement in Clinton's words... abortions should be safe, legal, and rare.. I think that's how he put it.
So I definitely agree with the limitations.
I've never known of anyone to get one, but I suppose this is Blacksburg.
Whoa, they're back on the mic!
Those sound like fair circumstances.. So many complications to think of though.. vimeo.com/28501846 If not the filibuster, you don't want to miss this one. :P
Oh definitely.. I thought it was funny. :P
Whoa. This looks cool!. I'll watch it (:. Ahh, this is scary!
:3. That was neat.. I'm not sure that I understood the ending though.. Were they tracking him and they meant to let him escape?
o.o Whoa.
hehe, is this one based on the game, Portal?
Ahh, I think I'm falling asleep :P I'll watch the Portal film when I get upstairs.
Thank you (: I hope you have sweet dreams tonight and every night, too
You has me in your heart (:. Always.. I'm going to brush my teeths and head upstairs before I really do fall asleep :P
Aw. I will miss you too, even if I don't miss you.. :3 . Nightnight, Peter.
(: 
Hi (: I think I hear thunder! 
Drawing picture with you sounds nice (: 
:D! Yes! Digimon! . hehe, "I need a cookie right now or I will die." 
That's some pretty serious cookie wanting. I feel that way about you at times.
Bowl shaped cookie? :P 
That's a good idea! It might need some extra something to help it hold up better though. . Flour maybe? :P However they make waffle cones, just with more cookie ingredients. 
Too crazy! :P We should try it! I bet if you squish it down in between when it's cooking it could become more hollow 
Baking is fun with you. (: 
:3! I have fun with you.
We should do fun sometime. (:. Here comes the rain... do do do do
:D I'd like getting caught in the rain with you.
om nom nom.. When I saw the title, I thought this was an entree :P
All it needs is pasta and some meat :P
Those looks nice too! :D Raining.fm? Is that rain noises? :P
:P hehe, we have lots of those outside
:D And bush babies too.. Oh, I've done this one before with Twe!
They're like... related to lemurs and they have big eyes.
Those last two statements contradict each other according to the website's grading scale. 
:P It's a neat puzzle.
Oh, I only have 8 so far :P
Well thanks :P I think I'd rather just be Leandra though.
(: I'm glad you think so.. 13 of what in a Baker's dozen?. loafs?. :P
such a funny word.
*shhh...* I haven't gotten there yet.. :P
Good for you :D. protectorates? :P . pinapples!. pineapples*. aw... provinces?. Which ones are those? :P
Like the last ones to not be official countries?
I think they are similar to protectorates, but there is some distinction.
I memorized them for Jeopardy :P Northern Cape, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Gauteng, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, and I can't remember the 9th one.. Oh, North West.. The provinces seem to be like the "states" of South Africa, and each one has their own unicameral legislature.
Nah, I just researched :P
You're amazing (:
So computer minds can be read!
Did you see the lightnning right before that thunder hit?. It was so close.
But you're not like other humans? :P
So it's like a smart computer?. I thought it would just be random :P
Well it sounds like a good strategy. :P I'm sure you shook things up quite a bit in the virtual world.. And those lok like reese's cups!. mmm! Apple pie pie!
That's okay :D I'm just fixing a toy.
It's the ripcord launcher to the plane; I accidentally snapped the rubber band inside. Whoa, I've seen this page before! ;P. :P*
That's okay :3
Yay! I fixed it! And doodling sounds like lots of fun!
Okay (: . Byebye for now!
I'm available right now, or anytime (:
That would be cool!. I mean, I would like to (:
You're the best (:. Any doodles in progress?. I really really like the one of Bear 'n' Bear. The one where the girl character is standing.. And I like the other one too (:
Yes :D Digimon!. Do you still remember how to play the card game?
That's handy (:. Well I would love to play with you!
You're the best ^_^. There are no better things
What could be better than you? Besides the addition of more awesome things.
I would like to come over too :3. My mom got a tablet device thingy to help with her tutoring :P. It's called the zeepad
I'm not sure how to turn it on :P I guess it needs charging before the first use.
That's okay. Thanks for asking about the ride, but I think I'd be able to drive over. I'm going to do a few more chores first to gain my mom's favor when asking. :P. What time would be a good one?
Well, okay.
Aw, I didn't mean to make you feel bad. :( I wasn't quite sure what to say.
(: That sounds very nice. . How is your poison ivy bite doing?
:D!!! Go Peter!!
I hope it recovers extra quickly this time around! :3
Alright, I'll go do some more chores ^_^ . . Byebye, Peter!
What are the plans for doing things today? :3
Sounds catchy. :D
[[peter.mattox]]
It's a magic trick :D!. And that looks like a cute cartoon.
mmm I've done that before!. A little differently though :P. Night night (:. I like this comment: "despite their high caloric value, they're remarkably easy to prepare"  how do these two factors contrast each other?. :P They have a good point there.. Oh, I've figured it out!. Well, sweet dreams for now, Peter!. I am sorry that we didn't get to do anything today, thus making my day insurmountably less fun.. (^^^). :3 Have nice dreams!
(: Good night and sweet dreams to you too!. (:. I'm sorting all my school papers right now :P There are so many.. Good thing I've put dates at the tops of all of them.. Except for a few that I had to think more about.
Oh yes, they prove to be quite the challenge to place anywhere.
Yes, that'd be great!
Aw, looks like some people still have to work. :P. on Fridays, I mean.. And that peanut butter looks crazy. :P
Crazy crazy. :P
That's a deep subject.
:D! You made a rhyme!. I would like to hang out too. . Any time without you, I'm blue.. So I think it'd be the best thing to do--being with you. (:. So, I'll pick you up at 7:30am tomorrow?. Or would you prefer 7:00? I'll need to be back by 10:00 to go to Chik-Fil-A with my mom. :P
Yay!. Okay, see you then (: I'm going to try to finish organizing. and then I'll get to sleeps (:
Silly stuffs? :D
Sleep night (:. tight*
:P hehe
Yay! Those are awesome! :3 Let's make some!
Would you like to go camping from July 4th - July 6th?. Or if you like we can just do one night from July 5th- 6th. I forgot about the 4th of July :P. Whoops.. But after that..
I wouldn't want to miss the Blacksburg celebrations and seeing everyone :D
Cool! :D Or 2nd-3rd. Depending on the weather.. And that way we could have that garage sale!. Yard sale, I mean.
You're cool!. Think we could find that tent?. Or should I look for one on the interwebs?
Okay :D Maybe we could look tomorrow after we mow? . That way it'll have enough time for the shipping, if we can't find it
:D! Would you like to go to the Salem Fair this year?
Yay! :D. July 3rd looks like the best day to go because of $10 wristbands, but we could go any day :D
Yay! Me too (:
I'll doze off too :P
Night, night!. Sleep tight!. Dream of niceness (:. And by that, I don't mean foolishness.. :P
:P With marshmallows, of course!. Night night (:
Aw :3 Goodnight, sweet Prince. I love you.
:D! . Free blue desk for the quirky, anti-atavistic. Yes I know, all the cool kids like gnarly wooden furniture that looks like it grew out of the ground that way. But you are not a conformist. You are an individual. You want - nay, you NEED - a desk made of unrecyclable material painted in the color least found in nature. Unless you count water, which cover 71% of the earth's surface. And, of course, the sky.   This desk is just like the beautiful earth you call home and thus will provide the semblance of the wild you crave when trapped indoors at your work-station like a robot. Or perhaps, in your android form, you would more closely identify with the lustrous quality of the forged and burnished. This desk is just what you need. It is made of metal and weighs...   Yes, it weighs. Nothing more can be said of its indubitable mass. It is of epic form and legendary caste. One could imagine it came from any time, any class of wealth, any possible culture. It is one-of-a-kind, and I know this because I painted it myself after purchasing it for $14.00 at the Goodwill. Oh yes, it has history. If you like to own things of antiquity, that hum with the unmistakable aura of experience long past, then this is the desk for you.  And yet, there is something mint about this desk. In many ways it exudes a freshness, an ultra-modern sensibility. Like a toy opened by a child on the last night of Channukah, it is pristine; unfamiliar yet filled with potential. Think of the masterpieces you will craft upon its rostrum. Think of the power with which you will tackle those work or school-related tasks. Think of the force with which you will slay that zealous beast, procrastination.  And of course, when you succeed in all things you hope to succeed, you will find yourself bathed in glory and riches. You will have the opportunity to replace the free blue desk with interminable descriptive. But you won't. You will pass that desk on to your children. They, in turn, will pass the desk to their children. And the legend will live on... 
It was so crazy that.... explosion!
I really enjoyed it.. The desk looked nice too.. Would you like to go to a yard sale tomorrow at 7:00 am on Harding Avenue?
Yeah! It's 450 I think.. I'm not sure how close it is- Harding is a long road!. ish.. ishy.
It would be even longer of a trek if one were to row a boat along the road.
:D I have rowed for days along this road that I like to call the river.
Whoa.. That one was crazy.
Crazy as in amazing and lyrical genius, I mean!. :3
Yeah! :D That's a good idea!. I would like to be on time to pick you up too!. How about I pick you up at 6:55?
Night night (: See you then.
Hi!
(: Good Morning! :D I made it to Charlottesville, but I think I left my phone somewhere, so no phone for now... :P
Okay, cool! :D. Are the rooms carpeted?. / Should we bring our own sheets/ pillows?
Cool! Thanks for letting me know!  
(: I have come to the conclusion that you are a super awesome person!  I hope all your sleeps have gone well and I hope your day goes super nicely! And if you ever run out of things to do, or would like to.. You are invited to my house! And although it may involve me having to do chores, there could be breaks for fun things of your choosing. (:
Yay for chore day! I had fun with you (:  And you're not a terrible host, I just have silly thoughts.
That's okay, the best people are late! ^_^ . Should I wait for in person to tell you? 
Hi by the way!!!!!!!!!!!!11 The 1's are on purpose because I'm so excited that I had trouble holding down the shift button! 
They are silly thoughts because it's a selfish way to think, wondering if it meant that you don't quite like me like before.  They are very silly thoughts like wondering what you were doing and being a little sad thinking that you would rather do something else than be with me, even if you had the opportunity. And I knew it was a silly thought and then I thought maybe you were just using the restroom or doing something for me and then that would be okay, and those were even sillier thoughts. And if I think that way then maybe I'm not the very best person to be with.  Because the world doesn't involve around me and there are other things you do that are more important than me and I should realize that :/   Worms Europe is cool! I would play it on this tablet if it didn't require Flash!
Well now I'm even sillier :P  *whispers* Okay, I can keep a secret!. Aww, you're nice ^_^ andI'm still silly! 
It's okay. I just thought things weren't going so well between us. I was hoping the poem would cheer you up and make your day nicer!  http://item.mobileweb.ebay.com/viewitem?sbk=1&nav=SEARCH&itemId=161060719558 
It's probably just me then? It's so crazy! I'm not sure what the snes controllers look like, but these look like they could be compatible with the snesbox website! 
Awesome! I might look into getting these for us to play long distance if the reviews are good! ^_^
Okay ^_^ !                       http://item.mobileweb.ebay.com/viewitem?sbk=1&nav=SEARCH&itemId=161060719558   The longest answer is the most helpful! 
It's the onewiththe source as healthkicker.com. I canjust paste it here though! . Just kidding, it's difficult to copy things except urls on this tablet :P But you may have to click "other answers" to see it if you are interested 
http://www.healthkicker.com/754507360/are-you-cleaning-your-ears-correctly/ Oh, this is it! It seems like good info :3
whoops. Well, I bet that would've been more interesting!!  :P . How is that auction doing? 
hehe, you go, Peter! 
Whoa, it's SUPER bomberman :P Hi!. Would you like to join me for a Christiansburg venture tomorrow? Our first stop will be breakfast at I-Hop and then Bed Bath and Beyond for some hangers and then to the consignment store which opens at 10am, and anywhere else you would like to go!   . Also you can get a free meal at ihop by joining their birthday club with this link: http://www.ihop.com/pancake-revolution.  Just have the email they send you printed out and you're good to go!
Ihop with you was pretty swell! :D . You're so so nice :3 Thank you for taking me home. You give me little butterflies still.. }|{ These ones, to be exact.
Would you like to make a cheesecake with me today in honor of national cheesecake day? I think the only thing I'm missing is the crust! Depending on the recipe. We can order pizza too, if you like! :3 
My kitchen is open as far as I know, but if you'd like us to be at your house, that would be neat too! :D
Then would your house be better? I wouldn't want to be a bother to your family either.
I can ask my mom right now! :D I'll be going out to christiansburg with her for a bit today, but we should be home at around 3:00pm.. Dominoes has large 5 topping pizzas for 6.99 each! :D
Did you know you can put triple pineapple on a pizza? O.o!. Yo, it's crazy, moon.
That sounds neat! :D Is it playing out well in your head?
Well, don't let me distract you. :P Unless you get stumped, and maybe talking would help ^_^
:3 You have the perfect amount of spontaneity to make the little things funny.
I think so. (: And you're the best one for cheering me up.
Someone else named Peter Mattox? :3 No, it's you. It's always you.
It's not ridiculous. If you know me, you'd know that there are more ridiculous things I could say.
Exactly that. But if you can imagine it, then it's not ridiculous enough. :P
Does this call for the suspicious face! . Oh no, I think I've forgotten what it looks like! That means I need to see you stat!
:D!! Oh, change of plans. I'm going to Kroger to do some shopping, and then after I can pick you up and we can make cheesecake at my house, if you like!
I forgot that my mom has to go to help a friend at the laywers.. laywer's*
Oh so crazy. But making the screenplay sounds important so 3:00pm can be a nice time anyway ^_^
What is the last line you've written? :P
:D! You're awesome. I can't wait to see it! . I can stop bothering you soon. But I don't know if I ever got an answer, so I wouldn't want to force it.  Would you really like to make cheesecake and eat pizza with me today?
! :3 Yay!
Video games do sound like they fit the store's name! :P Do they have the classics that you're looking for?
I hope you find something you want. ^_^
That sounds like a nice plan! And you could always call to save you some time for your screenplay!
That would be fun! :D! Yay! It sounds like an adventure!
That's alright (: hehe, authors don't have to shower.
Okay :D That would be great!
I'd wait for you to go into the store, but I'll head over whenever you start heading over :D
Okay (: I'll head down then!

A trip plan with 3 extra pawn shops--these ones are the closest to Happy's!
Yay! Infinity. :D . (I haven't watched it yet), but by the title, maybe it's about.. parallel universes? dun dun... :D . Yay, that was cool! :3 Thank you for sending it too me! 
to* It was a nice extension to our conversation from earlier. :3 
Your words are the ones that get to my heart, though. (: 
I would definitely be interested. (: When do we start? 
Sweet dreams, Peter! I hope you are home safely! ^-^
Yay! I was home safely too (: 
Yup yup, but my sister was there too, so I felt bad making her wait for longer than 7 minutes. I'm lots of sorry :(
That's okay, I should have charged into your house, but I feel weird just entering. If only there was a doorbell :P
It's alright (: Oh no, I just didn't think of that.. Well you're still allowed over if you like! I can even bike over and accompany you (:. Or we can play at your house!. (If you'd still want to, that is)
That'd be awesome :D Does your bike still work?
I wouldn't want you walking either.. :P Hmm.. 
Awesome! :D Okay, well that at least gives room for me to give you a ride home. And I'll try to tidy up my room so we can play there!
(: I can't wait to see you!
Hello! :D Good morning to you too. :3 I'm good! I think I've slept too much though :P
You were awake at 6, I think! :D. Whoa, movie!!!
Whoa! :D Like with bows and arrows?
That's super cool! :3 If it had a good plot, that means your sleeping brain is amazing. :P How'd you ruin it? Or did you mean.. Make it better!?
You being in it would have made it the best movie!
ya-huh!. I want to play mario with you :P
Oh no, I missed the wish! :P
It would be awesome! :D Could we play today?
Yay! (: I find that most of my wishes are having to do with you, anyway :3. Ahh, what is that? :D I'll watch it!
I like how everyone's eyes are all welly :P. I can't wait to see yours up there (:
character building, schmericer building :P. I bet it'll be great :3
Xatu! :D Yay! :3 Thank's for letting me know.. hehe, what is schmericer anyway?
Wow! Me too!  It sounds like someone saying America :P
schmericer :P
You're amazing! :3
!!!!! But Peter is the best boyfriend and friend and amazing guy (:. I like you.. I'm going to go get ready and things! :D
:3 I hope I'll get to see you.
:D! hehe, yesterday was so much fun already!! (:. What time are you free today?
:D! Yay for episode 5! I would like to help mow (:. I can come help until 1:50! 
It'd be awesome!. I'll go shower and then go over! :D . If it's alright
:3 It's definitely okay (:
Besides, you always smell good!
I'll try to be ready by 1:00 then :3 I'll go to it and then text you
!! So that's where it is :P ! Just kidding, I figured such. Goodmorning/nearly noon! :3 Any plans for today, Peter? 
I'm going to lunch for now, but plan to be back soon...YAY ITS YOU . sorry, caps are scary. 
Yay! :D Thank you! Byebye for now, I suppose I'll be back around 1 or 1:30 or so? (: Have so so so much fun over where you are ^~^ I like you too.. so so much! (: BYe!
:3 . :3. It's the same smiley face! Just 8 hours later!  I've been holding it for all that time... :P 
Yay! We have so much in common! . Want to go on a trip to Busch Gardens with me sometime? :P 
Yay! I can't wait! Today I am trying really hard to pack so I will be free for tomorrow and the next day! 
I do too (:  I will get right to it then and keep on going ^~^ But first... Are you having a nice day? 
Because because (:. wait, because? :P
Well.. It's not so crazy if you have other business there too. But if not, then I say that you should just pay them through paypal to ship it and call it a day.. :P
Ooh, are they craigslist listings?. Links :D
Neat! :D Did you tell them you live in Blacksburg?. /Virginia
Neat! :D Well, if he's willing to go to the post office tomorrow, you can pay him through paypal for a medium or large flat rate box (11-25 dollars), and then he can put it in and send it :D.  If he's not willing, then you can decide whether you'd like to make the trip!. Gas money may cost more or less than shipping costs. But time is valuable too? :P
You mean with the shipping?
 Gas might cost you a full tank. However much that is :P. It'd be fun if you went with someone else though :D
I was silly and used a calculator, and gas could cost up to $50 for the trip, depending on which car you take.. But if you take my helicopter, we could be there soon! :D
Yeah :D That might be neat. . It seems like $35 would be a good price for all that? 
Whoa, well I bet you can find what you're looking for with all these consoles floating around :3 . I wish you the best of luck, but for now I must away . Ttfn (: 
Good morning! :D 
I'm okay ^~^ How are you, Peter? 
Whoa! What a coincidence!  We have so much in common, we should do something sometime (:
It would be super duper lovely! :3 My mom says I will have to do housework today, but maybe I will be free this evening. . Did you have a fun day, yesterday? :d. :D*
Whoa, that day sounds crazy!. :3 But you're fantastic, so your company is the very best!
Whoa! :D . All those games are really neat
:D Well if they go for it that'd be neat. It's not too too low.. I looked up all the games in the lot and they'd sell easily for ~130 dollars on eBay!  :P . Any then there are like 3 controllers and nunchucks and crazy :P. Anywho, I better go get ready for now!. Roanoke is far away, but on the way to Charlottesvile!. Ttfn!
Don't spend too much time on Craigslist, it sucks people in! :P. Neat! Me too!
Well, I'll pass it on the way to college!. If that counts. Yup, in the morning
More time for what?
Aw. . It does go by quickly.. I gotta go before I start thinking about missing you!. Byebye :3
It's okay. I was scared I would tear up too much. You're so so so amazing! 
Thank you ^_^ If you need me, I am with Twe until 2 and her number is 808-6454
Aw, thank you. I tried to be super safe. :3 Just finished mowing the lawn and am now fixing the faucet!  . Oh wait :D I don't have to anymore! What are you up to? It'd be neat to do something with you :3  
:D!  Yay! . I will give you a call once I finish up with a bit of email ^_^ . If that's alright! 
I'm not sure what my favorite TV Show and movie are :P 
:D! I did put firefly for one of them, but I think I'd need to watch more of it to qualify. I like Psych. And... . Chuck!
I'm on the way now ^-^ Should I just barge right into your housie?  . I love you, Peter! :3 Sweet dreams.
:D!! You're the best! 9:30 am tomorrow, unless you need more sleeps ^-^
(: I won't wake you up if you're still asleep then? :3
Okay :D I'll do it :P And maybe lay down and snuggle with you too.. Me too! :3 Sweet dreams, sweet Peter.
That would be nice. :3 ! Also, have a wonderful sleep!. I lovvvfe you too ^-^ 
Bye :D
!!! Yay!. You're awake!
Hi! :3
Hi (: I'm doing well. Just setting up my yoga mat :P. How are you?
Yay! Imagination!. *rainbow*
aw :3 I so so so hope you can find one!
Like Eneas did!. :3 (be right back, I'm going to be super quiet and go brush my teeths!)
Okay ^-^ Is it important to have the original?. I like you.. I like you so so so so much!
Okay, I got you. ^-^. And I'm yours.
They are a long term product then! :3. I will try to look too, around this area!. Maybe there's a video game store downtown
Oh nos!  No, you're amazing and I should have reminded you!
The guy I bought my engineering textbook from told me I shouldn't pay more than 20 dollars for any textbook because I can get them from other students :P. But it's so difficult to find!. It's my job to make sure you don't ever get sad, and maybe that would've helped
Ahhh. That's scary!
Noo, don't be sad :(. What is the isbn, I will find it!. :3. It will work out!
I found an online access code, but I'm not sure :P http://www.biblio.com/tomlin/university-core-a~74709189~title. Aw, just kidding, different isbn, but close!
It could just be because it's the online version.. Which class is it for?
Okay ^-^ That sounds good. Just be sure to sell it right after the semester ends! hehe, we can both post books together!
It seems like they sell for less on eBay? Just from looking here: http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=n64+controller&_in_kw=1&_ex_kw=&_sacat=0&_okw=&_oexkw=&_adv=1&LH_Complete=1&_udlo=&_udhi=&_samilow=&_samihi=&_sadis=200&_fpos=&_fsct=&LH_SALE_CURRENCY=0&_sop=12&_dmd=1&_ipg=50. But I am not an expert on this :P. Maybe if they don't make you pay extra for shipping?
Yay! We were thinking the same? ^-^. Be right back, I will go shower while no one is there :P
Oh whoops, I think someone just went in :P hmm..
hehe :P. humnom nom! I wonder what's for breakfast today!. Oh wait, I'm good ^-^. Maybe if I'm super duper fast!
Yay! finished!. Was I fast enough?. Maybe :P I hope. Oh, and I. 'm not positive. I think I mowed it on Wednesday last. ^-^ Maybe she just needs to be taught. . But I will ask her
You're amazing!
Yuh-huh!. I've been keeping all my clothes folded and put away so far!. ^-^. Are you proud of me?
Yay! And whoa! Your classes are for tomorrow!
No, they are on Tuesday! Monday is still some more orientation things!
I know, right? :P. Which are your Monday classes?
That sounds like a very fun day! ^-^ Especially the first two!
Oh, okay! :3 Have a nice time at church! (:
And neat! I hope I can do something like that one day :P
:D! Yeah! Maybe it could be your own system :P. Have a nice breakfast and eat a doughnut for me ^-^. If you want
Aw :P hehe, that would be so awesome! Carol Lee Doughnuts are the best ^-^ But only when I'm eating them with you.. Byebye for now!

Have so much fun! I love you so so so much!
^-^ 
I like you ,silly :3. That's neat (: I wish check them out

The other one does too, I just hadn. 't clicked it yet! :P
How was church? :3
Just okay? ;3. :3*
I missed you bunches too. There are too many events going on over here :(

Aw (:. It's a mission!
:P It is pretty crazy! . How much money are you looking to pay for each one?
Okay :D I'll try to mind some for you!
find* :P I'm sorry.. i bought a lab coat.. It was so expensive though :(. I thought they'd have some at a goodwill? :P
Yeah! Melissa Carlier and Brittany Fan said they will show me :D
Sounds like a plan (: Maybe someone won't know what they go to. My day has been nice. It was a wonderful start to my day getting to talk to you! Today is a 122 days to Christmas Party which I can wear my Christmas sweater too! How about your day? 
Just a lil' ? . I wish you were here to hang out with! :3 Study times with you will be nice though, if you'd like to do that!
I wish I could help you pack! :D . At least you will have no worries about forgetting anything!
Yay! :3 . I think I will go out and meet more people in the dorms!
Okay, thanks (: I can't wait to maybe have you over! It's motivation for keeping my room super nice!. Byebye for now, Peter (:. I love you.

Good morning!. Aw :/ Don't worry, I"m just busy because of all the orientation activities. Today is the craziest for engineers.. Today is the day we discuss the books and hear the dean speak and crazy things like that! :P
 I think so. I had trouble finding a facebook page where radford students exchange textbooks! 
Awww :3 Thank you so so so much for sending these all to me. They make me happy. Like you (:
I like this one a lot (:

I am too! 
Good morning! I hope you have the best day ever! 
Awww.. Those are so cute ^-^ How did I miss them?
Yay! Internet! (: Now you can do graphic design?
And that's why you are the bomb diggity. (hehe, I just wondered for a significant amount of time why spellcheck  underlined the word "diggity.")
(: You're silly too.. P.S. Those peanut M&M's never stood a chance.... Thank you for those! :3
It happened.  Is that very crazy? o.o. I was just studying for calculus.. and they were just a great graphic representation of the ellipsoid.  So I ate them.
^-^ Would I distract you too much if I skype called you (if you're not in a call aready)? 
Okay, I understand :3 . I'm actually going to sleep right now :P Surprisingly!
Night night (: (As soon as I finish Calc homework :D) Sleep well and good luck with finishing things too!
I love you, Peter! ^~^ (bearhug)

Oh yeah! :3 I think that is the one you have loaded on your zune? :D. Which one will you pick?
Oh! Okay! :3. Wow, so many colors :P. I would pick cydaquil because I like how its eyes are all squinty :P
Yay! He's so cute!. "His squinty eyes are adorable!"
Hey :3. You;re adorable!
It is a title that fits you quite well, though (:. I am coming back from the 11th to the 13th :D. I think our break is until the 15th though
It would be nice to get to spend time with you that weekend :D. My only ride back to Charlottesville is either Sunday night or Monday morning, though
Why would I want to forget about you?
I always want you in my system ^~^. You make me happy.
You're awesome :3. I think I am falling asleeps soon

I am not working hard enough :(
Maybe I will just wake up early? :P. hehe, that's okay (:. In the belly button?!
I've been looking at housing listings, so maybe that is productive?
There is one that is only $500 a month including utilities, and that sounds pretty good!. Oh whoops :P I meant... like.. room listings. What do you think?
Nah, it would be with 2 people in the grade above me. Does that sounds crazy?
hehe :P As old as pie@. !*. It is one of the best prices I've seen so far :P
Neat :3 I'll see how it goes. I think I'll start looking more next year
Cool beans!
:D!! I've always wanted to be a legume :3
:D!! A coolberry! (: Being a chickpea would be cool too, because then I could say "Pio pio pio"!. (:. You would be a sunglasses wearing bean. Or a kidney bean, because those are kind of shaped like a heart (:

:P Tackles don't make people fat, Peter!. :3. I can bring you a loaf of bread from the dining hall! Would that help you?. Whoops, maybe foods should be a surprise? :P I just want to make sure that they would get eaten.
Yay! :3 I will keep this in mind (:
Whoa! How did you poke me so many times? :P
You are definitely magic! (:  Oh no :/ Is it the one due tomorrow? You will finish, you can do it! :3 Don't forget to eat foods.  If you need any help, I'm here. 
I can look (:
Are you sure? I just need something in particular to look for, and I'll try to find it!
I want to help you as much as I can (:
This is tough! o.o . Hey... you don't forget to eat either!. I had a nice salad and soup!
Oh, when was this!. ?*
Okay, thank you bunches for letting me know!. This is indeed a difficult task
You're amazing :3 I hope the links will help
"You poked Peter.". It changed from "Poke successful!"
I know, right? :D. Did you know that you can take a bus back to Squires from Radford for free?
it is?
Yeah! :D! It means that you don't have wait for someone to pick you up!. Unless you have more than you're able to carry in one trip :P
Hey, you :P

Thanks (: What are you up to?
Whoa!! Say "Hi" to him for me! (: 
Aw, well thank you anyway (:. Your topic should be about how lobster forks are a suitable alternative to dessert forks :D. Just kidding.. :P But um... Is it a persuasive essay?
Yay!. Well I bet that informal presentation provided lots of different ideas?

They are wonderful looking, Peter! :3 Thank you bunches for sharing them with me! 
they're so so sgreat!
boop
Boop ^-^. (:
Doop!. Whoa o.o. This is strange.. What happens if I type a super long paragraph that stretches across the whole page and explosion? :o!. Aw, it didn't reach.. Is your chatbox like this too?
I do say, Peter, you have just used many words to describe processes that happen and was somewhat vague, but very clear at the same time.  I just cannot slightly begin to quickly comprehend the utmost usage of great adjectives before any ordinary word and the brightly use of grandiose adverbs before any exciting verb. I subtly think that this is the true way to wonderfully craft needlessly wordy and nonsensical, difficult sentences.  The interesting meaning become completely intertwined and utterly lost the the general human understanding. Why do some regal groups of several people stealthily choose to always write in this confusing manner? I mightily ponder what suiting method of modern english would blindly dabble in such a dangerous art. I like what you wrote a lot better and will forego all those cumbersome adjectives and adverbs! Oh no, I think I got trapped with regalness.  Banana bread could change all that! What is the occasion? :3 I love you, too Peter and I think you are the most amazing guy and so so cute!
Yay!! :D That is a good reason for banana bread!. Aww, you saved me bananas? :3. So nice
mmmm!!!!!!!!!!! :D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I can taste it already ^-^
Yay!!! :D. And pears!. :P
:3 om nom nom
They are up there with mangoes and pineapples :D
meow :P Do cats eat fruits?
Me too :D
Whoa! Is that even real? :P. Pretty awesome!. How did it taste?
mmm!!! You have so many good ingredients (:. Just make sure the cinnamon isn't ever accidentally italian seasoning! :P
That is always a good idea :P 
Yay! \ \   
boop!
koopa!
boop!
loop!
Pie!
Om nom nom !!
om nom!\\ 
You're so so cool! 
You so awesome :3 
Hello here too to you too!!!
hi hi hi !
!!! (: Sorry, I got distracted by cookies!. Have so so much fun in mythology! Watch out for the rain!
I love you!!!. Not as important as you!. My small group asked about you, so I told them how awesome you are ^-^
beep!!
That's okay (: I was meeting someone very quickly!
Yeah!!! I am so so happy!. It is terrible, but last night I lost my bottle cap pin, but someone I know found it and I just retrieved it from them! (:
So, I think this bottle cap has stood the test of my carelessness (I didn't notice it falling off!)
So good!. hehe, Yeah :P 
Okay (: There is so much love in the bottle cap that I was so sad to have lost it! But it's all good :3. How was the exam?
Critique, what does that mean?. And that's good :3
Yay (:. So, dachshund + yorkie = dorkie :P . funny naming conventions!. I better get back to studying and let you get to work too (: I can't wait for friday!. Ttfn!
Yes :3
Everyone but my sister, but I will do that shortly!. Your ride is https://www.facebook.com/dana.martin3?fref=ts&ref=br_tf . And she will pick you up from your house on Friday between 3:00pm-3:30pm. She will text you when she gets close that way you can be by the sidewalk so she can find your house!
Sorry, am I kidnapping you? :P
Do you mind?
And yup, just clothes, a possible toothbrush, and your laptop so you have things to work on while I'm studying :3
Oh no! I will make sure you are well fed when you come to visit (:. I love you!. Ttfn :3
You're so so perfect :3 I want to be the nicest for you! Byebye and good luck with all your work!
hehe!!!!!!! :D!!!!!   . I don't think you realize how much food there is o.o!! You'd have to be Scooby and Shaggy to eat all that food :3 
:D!!
(:
You're awesome! 
Hey! :3  You ^-^ Hi!
^-^ You are the best ever!!! 
It's so so so so so soso ssoooooo ootrue (:. You're great!
boop!. boop! I love you! (:
^-^
:]
:D I do?. I mean... I did?
Yay!
Did you remember to eat food? 
Maybe... :P. That looks so awesome!!!. A lot of stuff to store until we can get working on it, but I would love to :3
Or Rocky Mount, which is even further :P. But I would totally still consider it.. Then again, I'm crazy :P Maybe
Om nom nom :3 It's too far I suppose. Maybe he would go to Roanoke at least.... hmmmmmmm. :P 
humm num
mon mon mo
:P hehe!! It does sound Jamaican! :P. And nice pun :P
The rain was so so heavy on the way here :P. It was crazy!
Noo :P Just water drops. But I can see how you might confuse the two.. Just kidding :P

^-^ So much fun playing with you!
I think we're getting good!
Noo :P I always need reviving!
You're good and you always come save me (:
It's like being my honorary Leandra reviver :P
Better than Spider trapper?
Yes ^-^ Once you're knighted it doesn't go away unless you are treasonous :P
You're the best arroundd.. noone's ever going to take your crown :P
I changed the lyrics (: . *gasp*
{:)  <French person (beret!). {:o. That one is a "le gasp"
I can hear the coins rolling in now :P
I like your silly!. I think I will go back to my dorm room and take a nap :3
Naps are awesome!. And only 20 more pages of my book left!
Ttfn :3 Don't forget to work on your portfolio!. I mean.. Good luck with your portfolio :3 Because you don't forget ^-^
Ho hum :3 
Whoa, a message!
It makes beeps!

That would be neat. But at least it is later in the day so you can prepare a powerpoint (:
Yes, there is a lot of snow here already o.o!. (2-3 inches)
Oh, this song is nice!
Oh yay, there is snow!. I'm glad ^-^
That's what I thought! But when it's snowing, it's tough to drive!
Driving while it's snowing though, that's pretty tough, too!. :P
Whoa.
Aww, when you're typing it looks like a little face because of a smudge on my computer!. (:. .,.. Kind of like that
hehe!! It's funny because you were typing faces!. You're awesome!
You're wonderful!. ^=^
So true!
Noo :P I meant it's true that you're wonderful, of course. (: But I can tell you more in person!
Well, maybe I could be more convincing by drawing you pictures and making pie charts!
No :P My pie is elliptical instead of circular! Deception!
Oh I get it :P
hehe, no.. that's the treadmill pie
I like all your jokes! They're perfect!. (:
^^' Nah
Hey, aren't you hard at work?
Okay :3 But only for a bit. I'll always be here to talk, so no worries!
I'll always want to talk to you :4. (snowman) :4. =|:4)
Yay!!. =|:4)(--)(     ). Oh man!. \ =|:4)(--)(     )         /. .       \ =|:4)(--)(     )         /. Too much? :P. Yes.
Oh no o.o It's been done already!!. But that one doesn't have enough character :P. Just kidding, it's so amazing!! O>O
!!!  I get it!. :P
No way, is that supposed to be an elephant? It's invisible!. :P. Have fun ^-^
I still can't see it!. Strange, huh/. ?*. And have an amazing class! (:
I can't wait to see the elephant! o.o
boop! (:
hello you (:
Was it awesome? ^-^!
:P Didja put cinnamon on it? ;P. :P*
That's okay :P. But you better get on the flavor train next time!. Maybe some italian seasonings up in there!. Some pepper!. Lemon
Aw :(. Well you're awesome at making flavors when you have all the ingredients!. Don't worry about things you don't have, just focus on the things you do :3. And water.. And groceries :P
Aw ^-^ You do have me!
I'm going to get off facebook for a bit to evade a classmate :P I'll be on skype though
Just someone who needed help with differential equations--- I gave them help, but now I'm going to sleep, so I said bye :P. I'm not sure if they may come up with other questions though o.o  I just sent them the link to some notes though!
:P Thanks!. Sorry, did that sound mean?
I realized it already is turned off :P
It's turned off for everyone except you :P. For some reason my skype is strange!. I will restart it!. :3
And I'll do some stretches for about 10 minutes before I sleep!. I can't wait to talk to you (:
ttfn (:
I'm not crazy :P Just about you!. Bye!
You make my day so happy (:
I don't do much to be so nice :P. Sorry to diagree :P. disagree*
Oh, I'm just me (:
You (:
You poked me.
O.o
Yes :P. 222 times!
Is yours at 223?. o.o!. Milestone!
That's awesome!
You make me feel consumed with happiness.. I can't wait till next we meet.
For you, I would save all my sweets.
(:
I want to do that still! Am I too late?. We could go get the thing printed before the movie! Because Radford is on the way back (:. I mean.. Christansburg is.. on the way back from Radford :P
Awesome!. I'll go find you and attack you. And we can eat sugary cereals ;P
Yay! Bedhead day!
Yay!. (: All the days with you sounds amazing!. Wind speed is optimal at 5pm! And the temperature will be alright at 56 degrees (:. Oh, sorry I missed your call!
Actually... the Wind Rises all the way until 6pm (:
Would you like to fly a kite with me? (:
boop (:
goop

Thanks for sharing! Some of those look really neat! And hey- There's that 5 centimeters per second one!
Hey :P
Hi!. Let go get food!. I love you!
Boop!
Good morning!. I mean... afternoon!
Good night to you too (:
^-^ Sweet dreams!
Boop!
!. Doorknob!. Soup in my bowl!. :P It happened!. Bank account!
You have my word! (:
Thank you~
Hello!!!
I am good!! (: How are you?
Hi there!. The parade is starting soon!
Hello!. Good morning!
I am good! How are you?. Camping today?
I would still like to camp!. Sorry I have slept in so much :P. Would you like to run errands with me today?. Kind of like yesterday's errands
:P A little bit different then.. We would go to Dollar Tree or Wal-mart for Super-glue. Then Old Navy, and possibly Belk to return some things!
I need a type called "Glass glue" But perhaps regular super glue would work too!. And no :P We're going back to those shirts.
Because they're awesome and will be difficult to find anywhere else for new.. Do you know which clear coat paint your brother used on the red truck?
As long as he is not too far away to ask!. Thank you.
Oh, that's alright then! I can just do some more online research!
Oh! I tried the M&M sweepstakes with a different e-mail address and I won!. I'm not sure if it was just good timing, or if it was because I switched addresses, but it may be worth a shot :P. Okay, I found the proper type of spray paint!. It would be awesome if I could borrow primer, since I won't need the whole can-- but I do have that kind I bought from a yard sale that I could test out!
Cool! And I'm sorry you lost :(. But it goes on until August 10th!. o.o!. Would you like to come on errands with me?
How long do you need? (:
However long you need :P
Is that like motivation?. *Is that your motivation?. I will be there to pick you up by 2:00pm
^-^ Peter, It is such a pleasure knowing you. Your kind heart and ease of company rival even the most spirited of friendships. I hope to always be yours. I love you so very much. : 3 Yours. Truly. Leandra
Hello!
So I do! Thanks for the heads up!
Aw (: That sounds lovely
A glimpse through your message
I'm doing well! How are you?
Oh, my game is due on June 21st instead!. Psstt... Check your ymail!. Whoops.. June 22nd!. Just a silly Domino's Promotion :P
H'i!
I am good! I'm missing you though! How are you?
Hi!!!!
(:
(:. ( :
Hehe :P
Hi! (:
Good morning, Cutie!!!
I love you!
^-^
Whoa, it's you!
And it's us!. I was just checking the rideboards, but nothing yet!. Night night (:
Hello, hello!
It's going well! I was just checking to find out the value to write my rent check out for!. ^-^. See you on the other skype!
Boop!
Hello!!
I'm doing well! I'm getting back into the swing of coding.. How about yourself? How are you?
mmm apple!. (:. I still need to go grocery shopping :P
Oh yeah!! It looks like I will be going tomorrow, so that works out well (:
What was the main motivation behind printing presses?. (is that relevant? :P)
Awesome! I had thought it had something to do with politics. :P. What are some possible quiz questions?
Nice find!
What is a relief process?
I don't know the answer :P. Is copperplate printing or typographic printing a relief process?
Okay! I think they are in the same category, so whichever copperhead printing is, so is typographic!. Wait, scratch that.. Copperhead printing may or may not be relief, but typographic is!. What was Gutenberg's ink made out of?
Normally they wait until the exam to make it cumulative, but if you haven't had a quiz on the other chapters yet, then it would be plausible!
Then, plausible! Unless he said otherwise.
Like.. "Quiz on Chapter 5" means that it's probably only on chap 5!
You know what's what (:
Sounds pretty clear to me!
Aw (:. You're cute!
Awesome!!!!! That's a pretty good ratio of correct to incorrect
(')>. <('). (penguin). :P. Unsuccessful attempt!
Yay!! You got it!!. <(")
You are fantastic and talking to you makes me indescribably happy! ^-^
I have a thingy at 4:30pm that I am a bit late for, so I will head over now!. It is the shindig with appetizers :P
Thank you! I hope they have appetizers in excess!
Ttfn!
Hi!. I just did the career fair things!
Good luck!
Poke... back!
The trilogy!. What should I bring?
You (:. ^-^
Hello, you!
Awesomely because of talking to you!
Oh yeah :P
Hello!. May I reach you on skype?
Hi!
Good! How are you?
I like that one!!
Boop!
Hi!
Hello! : 3
Whoops :P I was helping with some brownie dishes.
They are cooking now!
I licked the cookie bowl!!
You're so fantastic!
Just fruits and healthy things ^-^
Hooray : 3 !!
You!. (just scanning for rides again :P)
Hi!. Ttfn :P
https://www.facebook.com/groups/185673608187473/?fref=nf This person might be passing through Charlottesville too!. Yay! So happy you are coming!
Hi hi!!!!
It's going well!
I skipped my 9am class, and my 10am class was cancelled o.o!. How are you?
Yes, it would have been nice-- but maybe my mum preferred to stay up late than to wake up early. :P. Oh no, what was your sad dream? :(
You are my boyfriend.! (hug)
I will load it up, then (:. I'll go to my 11am class, I think!
Oh no, what for?. I'd better go to my 11am because I have some crazy CS lab due tomorrow at noon :P
Well thanks for telling me-- I wouldn't have found it for awhile!!. I'm glad too!. I will get straight to work!. I hope 6 hours will be enough time to finish the lab :P
Oh don't worry, the 6 hours doesn't start until noon :P. But your day must get underway as well!. I hope your day is fantastic amazing!!
Why so sad besides the dream?
Just sad to see you go!. But I'll see you again this weekend I hope!
I will have hight hopes!. high*. But not too high!
Yes, high enough to search!
Hello! Just checking for a ride once again!. And yes!
A poke!
Hi hi!
https://www.facebook.com/groups/216063258498780/606360086135760/?notif_t=group_activity
Hi there (:
Everything is okay! How's everything for you?
(hug). (: !!
Hi hi!. (:
It's going well!. Thank you ^-^
And you're amazing wonderful!
Typing!
(: You should accept the compliments!. The ones that I'm giving you!
It's going alright! I just exercised and now I am about to start today's homework!
I glad that I can be yours ^-^ !
Yes yes!! And I am silly for suggesting I would like you more if you wore different clothes. In fact, your clothing has grown on me, and I like you just the way you are ^-^
I like you you!
No :P !!. But I thought of that today!
Apology accepted!. Wait, what are you sorry for?
Maybe stagnant, maybe amazing!
You're right, a halted conversation loses its namesake.
Yes, especially when there is a person listening one converse with themselves. That happens more often than you would think.. listening as one *
In the example I gave, I meant that it is sad for the spectator to be in a conversation where the other person is conversing with themself. :P. Because it means that the other person does not actually care to converse, or to hear anything from the second participant.
No, we are not conversing right now-- just interjecting thoughts.
I am being too harsh, too technical. I just mean, a conversation can only happen if we are exchanging thoughts and not just stating them.
It is not subject matter, but whether the subjects matter to the conversationalists :P
It matters or else my responses would not be as well-crafted or substantial.. Not that they are "well"-crafted. Just in the sense that they take thought.
I like you as you!!!!!!!!!!!. This weekend was the greatest!
You were the highlight of the weekend ^-^
Hi : 3 I hope to have many more adventures with you, too!
You are the best company!
Hello, Cutie!. Nice joke (:
So that's what he says!
boop
I like the boops and bops!. It's how I know you care!!
Boop!
Looking for rides!
Yes, as a back up!
I have been keeping a good eye out!. Thank you for the offer though!
(hug). Oh wait, that's for skype :P. (:
Boop!
Boop!. You're awesome!!!
(: You are the most courageous and sweetest garden potato!!!
You have battled the worst famines and pestilence to stay alive as a potato!
You'd be the best potato!
Hello! This time I am responding to a "Valley Road Girls" message concerning a subletter who will be jointing us for the spring semester while Kelci is studying abroad in Italy!. But I will check the ride board too :P
(hug). Oh no, that doesn't work here!
!!! Wow, that is really cool!!!. (switching to skype!)
hehe, I just saw that :P. My last class is out at 2pm, unfortunately!
Yeah! Might be able to go down with someone else.
If Jennifer's car doesn't fill up, then I could get a ride back with her!
She is a UVA student
Hi!!
Sorry! I've had a series of classes today!. No luck on the ride :(. I would still very much like to come visit you though!
This weekend is the best weekend though!
Yes :(
No plans yet!. I've gotta go for now. But I'll talk to you after dinner!
^-^. Ready for more Video Game HIgh school? :P. High School*
Yes :P I've got to do a bit of homework first though!
Reading what?
Big Fish?!
Whoa, cool!!. The mandolin book, then?
Ohhh!! That book!! :P. How is it? ^-. 6. ^
Are they getting married?!
Oh no!! o.o!!. Ready!!. Only time for one episode tonight!
Hi (:. (:. I'm doing well!! (: How are you?. I'm also good!
(:. hehe, you make sleeping noises too!
(: Aw!
:. (: *
You're whale is cute!
Your*. You are the best guest ever!!!
Hi!. No new rides posted!
This looks like spam. :o
Hi Peter, thank you for your quick response. I frequent your wall often, and that just came to my attention.
Hi Peter, I love you so much and can't wait to see you again!. https://github.com/MSOpenTech/msopentech-tools-for-intellij
Hey : 3
:#
It's a blushing face!!
Poke!
Hello!!
Yes!!. I remember my dreams too!. Talking cat!?!. (be right back!)
Back!. How did you sleep?
That's okay!!. Good morning!. Wow, that talking cat was so cool!!!. Me: "Can I hug you?"  Cat: "No."
Me: "Would you like some water?" Cat: "Yes, please!"
Oh don't worry, I hugged it anyway!
Before it said No :P. That cat was smart!
You're warm!
Howdy!
Doing well! And you?
(: Must be the ice cube pulling in wifi!
Hello!. Sorry, you caught me as I am about to leave for home!
Thanks!. Ttfn!
Sorry, I go in and out!
Hello!
Thank you!!
http://bit.ly/1EOLRe7
Yay, I've got you? ^-^. Also, your Facebook says that you are playing "Trivia Crack".  :P. If you are not, then I would be concerned with it saying this.. Just thought you should know!
Yeah!!
:P Bring it back!
Oh yeah :P Okay.
I love you too!. I just can't get over how that cat looks like it doesn't have legs!
Yeah, I'm stalking you!
I didn't use those words!
Oh no,I'll do it!!. Byebye for now!
Hello!!
I am doing well! The apples are really good!! How are you today?
Yes, so good!. Thank you for helping me buy them!
Pstt...
Yes?. :3
I did!
Just you.
Yay, it's you!!. Just you!!. No chocoate!. : 3
I'll choose you, still1. !*
I can?
That would be awesome!
Hugs from you are great too!. :3 Then you get lots of them!. If you feel the same.
(:
Hi!
I'm okay, and you?
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/punchbrothers/anothernewworld.html. I am programming a website!
Designers and programmers are the main creators of websites!
Yes, pretty cool!
I imagined it would be like the author's Blog. :P. author of the song*. Or um... The POV of the explorer
I was just clarifying what I meant!
I was under the impression that parallax scrolling was where the scrollbar keeps shrinking as more items are loaded when you get to the bottom of the page. However, I just looked it up, and it actually has to do with the relative motion of the foreground to the background.
Neat!
And then the glassy desert of arsenic white?
And the crew gathered closer, at first for the comfort, but each morning would bring a new set Of tracks in the snow, leading over the edge of the world, til I was the only one left.. Whoa, i just realized what this line meant!. Did you get it right away?. It it's what I think I'm thinking.... means*
Why not the way you imagine it? It can never be the way I imagine unless I am the one doing the art.. Even then, I would not do my thoughts justice.
And what of my inquiry?
No, my earlier question. There is nothing more to knowing the song better if we are both reading the same lyrics besides interpretation.. (individual interpretation, aside, I mean). Did you go to your appointment today?
If so, how was it?
Do you feel comfortable sharing?
I mean, do you share enough with the counselor?
Okay.. How was the rice? : 3. What makes it "fried"?
Mmmm!. Fried rice normally means that you take the rice and then recook it in a skillet with some form of oil.
Yum!
Hi!
Wow!! Go you!. I have a self-control problem O.o
Til' at last all around us was ____, one vast glassy.... What  goes in the blank?. And I just ate an entire bag of those jackfruit egg roll treats. ...
vastness, one vast glassy. hmmm
Does sound like fast as
I assume the lyrics are different because they just took Josh Ritter's version and pasted it in.
Only the {} parts.. Perhaps.
Must be vastness*
It looks like the transcriber wrote in a new stanza. :P
Sounds pretty good though!. Maybe there is a version that includes it.
It explains where the crew went!
Perhaps an alternate version.
I asked you earlier what you thought that meant.
And, what do you think it means?
Oh wow, I didn't realize that!
Who knows who came back for him, but a good guess that it would be his crew.. I understood that it would be better to die with his love.
I am wasting your time. Thanks for your thoughts!
And good luck with the webstie.. Night night!
Not going to sleep :P
No, just allowing you to get to work!
What is CC/. ?*
Oh, okay!. I didn't realize you have CS6!
You got it!
I see now..!
I like having you in my life! ;3
:3. Sweet dreams toyou!. (:
Good morning (:
(: !!!. Have an awesome day!!
I slept well! :3 I hope you did too and that your walk will be nice!. Today is free cone day at Ben and Jerry's!
The closest one is in the Christiansburg's mall, I believe!. But that's too much hassle just to get ice cream :P
(hug)
can't* ?
That's okay! I knew what you meant ^-^
From the side, looking slightly down?
Okay!
That sounds perfect!
Shall I search too?
That sounds like a lot of trouble for a project that is due tomorrow.
http://www.dafont.com/james-fajardo.font?text=Another+New+World&back=theme. Don't be sorry, I regret saying it.. I just wanted to encourage you that there exists a font already on the internet that you can use.
You're welcome!. (hug). I love you!!!
(:
I already have!
I apologize for walking so soon!
Okay! How exciting!
Hooray!
Double hooray!!!
The usual!
Veggies that you feel like eating! : 3
I care about you too!
And I will await your return!
My Mum already invited me! But you can come too!. And no.
You wouldn't be, I assure you!. But I know it is not the ideal outing.
(hug)
Wow, that's surprising!. i think I will turn in now.. Sweet dreams, Peter!
I will (:
I love you too.
hehe!. Night night (:
Good morning!! : 3
Hi!. (:
I'm still alive!
Yes!
I will some other time!. How has your day been?
No. I'm just busy :(. I went to Second Year Dinner today
:(
Would you like to talk about it?
Not to busy to read. Trying to avoid type since keys are too loud.. Good morning, Peter!

Yes!. I couldn't find any rhinos either!. But I found this bunny! (:. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_House. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Ferdinand
Oh! I thought you were just curious about children's books I like. :P. What sorts of children's books do you like?
Matilda is cool!
Always.
There's always anything else!. Which books need a character?
Okay!
What were you asking?
You'd like me to suggest children's books that have human characters in them?. Like Harry Potter, or Madeline?
Tin tin. Alice in Wonderland
No problem!
Thank you!. You too, Peter!
What was your day like today?. If I may keep you longer.. (pulls Peter back)
Wow! Good job!. I finished Heat Transfer homework this morning and spent a lot of time trying to print it! Then I worked on website making between classes. We worked on programming puzzles in my seminar class, and then I visited the entrepreneurial showcase, and then I went home and swept the floor and dabbled on mandolin and ate some food. I am studying for my Algorithms test now!
I noticed I know very little about the news, and that I have terrible social skills.
What does your font look like so far?
Wow! What was the inspiration?
Aw ^-^. :P
You should draw a little cartoon Paul with that speech bubble! :P
You don't have to, I just wanted you to imagine it!. I'm looking at proverbs right now even though I need to study.. I like this one : Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach a man how to fish, he eats for a lifetime.
I have, but it hasn't crossed my mind in awhile.. I want to tell this to people who I treat this way.
If they want to know the answer to a problem, I try to lead them to it instead of giving it to them. I have been lazy recently though, and I just let them copy. :P Not good of me.. But I was busy.... "busy"
Yes. But now they just have to find other people to give them fish.. Normally I like telling people to look it up, but that answer is not satisfying for people.. I will tell them this proverb next time.
:P Explaining things is nice, but not nice to them if I would have to look it up myself to explain it to them anyway.. I don't do this with you because I like you.. I look lots of things up for you because I know it saves you time!. Like those story characters.. But I don't know if those really helped.
Always! Unless I am in a time crunch to complete homework or at some meeting. But if it were dire enough, I am never really "busy". "Jack of all trades, master of none" -- this will be me. :P
I like doing everything, so I prefer it that way.. But I know you can never be really good at something if you don't focus all your time on that on thing.. The quote is not really correct though, and I could probably break the assumption!
But what would you say I am an expert at?
Googling things, perhaps!. The ultimate paradox!
That advertisement was a home run since you still remember!
Or you just have a fantastic memory.
Or more likely, things you find interesting?. As is usually the case when it comes to memory!
Aw, so soon?. :P
I was there, but in hindsight, I understand that not adding anything doesn't make for an active conversation! I had just hoped you would say that you are leaving rather than just saying "Goodnight" (though I often do the same).  Our conversations seem to be more like correspondences in that sense.  Also, I didn't know your laptop died. And you will surely see me again!
A valid assumption!
No.
I'm just studying!. Also, what would make you not the best in my life?. What would it mean to be the best in my life?. Sweet dreams!. I hope you sleep well!. Good morning!
(:
I slept well!. How about yourself!
That's great!. I apologize, I am just about to hop into the shower now!
Thanks! I hope to talk with you later!
Om nom!! Looks good!
Aww : 3 You don't know what I look like!
Hmm...
Not until after exams, I believe.
:p. (hug). Unfortunately, not today :(
Being hopeful is not a bad thing.. I had better get to class!. Ttfn (:
Do you know any fun facts about me?
Sky diving isn't detrimental!. :P. Not any more so than driving, statistically speaking.... Though you could argue that it is an unnecessary risk.. whereas driving is better justified.. Thank you for the fun facts! They are very nice.. I was thinking more along the lines of "Has a cousin who has been to space", but that really wouldn't say much about me.. :P
30 Fun Facts about Leandra! :. (I actually only need one, so feel free to say if you really like one or the other)
1. I like to be on stage, but I have never preformed before.  (hmm, something along those lines. I would love to do a variety show if I had any talent). Or is it common to like performing/being on stage?
2. I like trying to notice small details about my environment.  I also like discovering shortcuts and less-taken paths.. 3. I consider randomness to be a great sort of comedy on occasion! On the other occasions, punny referential jokes are nice.. I think I like dry humor too, but I'm actually not sure what that is.
4. I like memorizing things like geography, digits of pi, and song lyrics (We Didn't Start the Fire).
But what does that mean...?!
Oh! I think I understand.. Like Demitri Martin?
What would you call him/. 5. I learned how to Turtle Freeze in 9th grade. :P. I just like the name. ^-^. 6. I once spent 12 straight hours (possibly more) playing Sims.. I won't even mention Runescape.. 7. I designed my first website on Neopets in elementary school and liked making things in Windows Paint. 8. I can never seem to match actors and actresses up with their names.. (I am a name dropper?!). Or maybe I never learn their name in the beginning. 9. I have a fear of overflowing toilets and malfunctioning garbage disposals.. 10. I like staying up late, but I also like waking up early.. hmm.. I also like going to sleep early.. The only thing I don't like is waking up late. :P. (thing out of the 4 possibilites). 11. I write out daily schedules for myself when I have Things To Get Done.. 12. I am not averse to strange food combinations!. (a better fun fact would be to list a strange food combination I like)
13.. 14. When I picked out a car on Craigslist, I chose a bright orange one!. (not bright orange.. more metallic y). Just let me know if you see a neat one.
Noooo. :P You must be kidding.. 2nd choice?. Also, do you have a nice headshot of me, by chance?
It's not very good quality
No thanks :P. Anything  croppable?. It doesn't have to have a white background.
Okay!
Awesome! thanks!
Hmm, through which medium did you send it?. Hey... not that one! :P
Thank you though, I appreciate it!. Why are you missing it?
So it was intentional missing?. Playing hooky?
Do you have the pre-whited out version of the UVa id?
If only I weren't wearing a hoodie!. I appreciate the efforts (:. Not quite.... If searching through your pictures is taking up time, there is a thing called Picasa that finds all your pictures and organizes them by person.
Thanks!. I will just use my profile picture!
You helped!. What made you think you were "not any help" ?. Also, I hope you don't have to apologize this way again, but the phrase is actually "being of any help". If you want to sound proper and such!
No problem, it might come in handy if you are speaking to a professional one day!. Though I'm sure you knew the expression already.. 8. I once built a model ferris wheel out of skewers and matchsticks.. 9. When I was younger, I wanted to be a Mythbuster.. (These days, I would like to be a Part-time Mythbuster, but I wouldn't want to do that for a living even if I had the opportunity.. (Yes, I still haven't decided on a fun fact). to share.
For my Capital One Bio Book page.
If I were on a dessert island and I could only bring one thing with me, I would bring a spoon.. :P. My sprit animal is a polar bear because no reason.. spirit*. When I was little I played inside the dryer. (this one will have people concerned)
Oh, certainly the sporf!. :P. The joke was that people sometimes spell "desert" as "dessert". Did you get it?
(:. I'm still at a loss for choosing.
"I spent 2 hours trying to think of a fun fact about myself."
:P I like neither of them.
I would like one that makes people laugh or learn something new and is not a bad reflection of myself.
Kind of smart alec-y I'd say.
I'm very judgmental when it comes to myself. Though I can say all I want about not caring what other's think of me.. Also, what purpose did the "but okay", serve?. "I want you to perform heart surgery on this man!" "I'm not a doctor, but okay.". :P. "You are misinformed, but that's okay.". Ignorance is bliss?
I meant for it to be funny but also educational.. As in, be assertive about telling me if I am wrong.
Would you have preferred a more honest approach? I would have said... "The added "but okay." made me feel like you were saying "I know this is right, but I won't waste my time trying to convince you," and it made me feel somewhat inferior, but also bothered that you wouldn't stick up for your own opinions.    On the other hand, maybe that is the only time you've ever used that phrase and I just caught you at a bad time.. Or maybe you were just saying "You're wrong, but you're awesome, so it's okay.". Which would not be very good either.. :P
Would you mind explaining what you meant?
Okay. I apologize for occupying for time with that. That phrase just bothers me. It's somewhere along the lines of "whatever" in my head.. Apathy is the worst.
I thought of that too.
I've gotten into a habit of not saying things that I don't find useful. It has it's pros and cons.. I will break the habit, hopefully.. Well, anything I say must be useful to be if I bother to say it.. I mean that I try to limit myself to say only things that are useful after second considerations.. to me*
I feel bad that you feel like your feelings aren't important :(
(Note many uses of the word "feel"). I feel bad that you are apologize for making me feel bad when you didn't cause me feeling bad.. apologizing*. I caused me feeling bad because I control my emotions and grammar in this sentence does not exist.. **I caused myself to feel bad,. There we go.. Why can't I talk to you these days? :(
That could be. It's probably because I'm so judgmental of you too. I want you to be happy and good at carrying yourself and to be successful, so I get bothered when I think you are self-defeating or unarticulate.  But really, I am probably just project what I want for myself and my own criticisms of myself onto you. One option might be for me to hold my tongue. I, however, care deeply about you, which would make it difficult to stand by while you say things that I interpret as self-defeating.  If you actually feel quite confident about yourself, then please let me know, because I could just be misinterpreting your chatting!. projecting*. I can imagine that you are probably not too thrilled about me saying all these things.  I like when you tell me about things you are interested in and have been excited about lately. What are some of those things, recently?
That reminds me! ~ I am going to go see The Punch Brothers on July 14th! Would you like to come with me? don't feel obligated, because the tickets are quite expensive, and I would want to force it on you if it's not something you're already interested in.
Sorry to interrupt your typing.. You are who I want. I want you.
And Chris Thile is an amazing mandolin player!!!!
Yes. *video too!
That depends then, is $40 expensive to yoU?. you*. Do you a joint savings account? Or do you mean help you to set up an account?
For what purpose?
Okay! Is it enough to get a new account bonus on nextBlack Friday? (~$1000)
Don't feel like you need to add money to it!. You can even just keep all of it---you might need it to help pay for college!
If you wouldn't be opposed and could keep track of the amount, you could keep it in my account to collect interest for now, and then open a Capital One 360 account for it when the Black Friday promo comes around again!
Sure. It would only earn $5.60 extra per year at current.
Please take a picture before hand! I'd go with you if I were there.. This is the fun fact I settled on: I dream of exploring the world and helping others.
and world peace.
It's the only thing I feel comfortable sharing (because I hope it will inspire others). Anything else just seems unimportant, somehow.. I think fun facts are just designed to open up conversations.. primarily designed*
But other's won't find much use out of that.. I don't want others to know me from a fun fact.. Or at all :P
Well, that's not how I feel.
I just want to make it so other people want to save the world too!
I don't feel any need to be unique to people.. And coming up with something just for laughs feels wrong.
I feel like this fun fact is the most genuine one I've had yet.. The other ones just seem to be citing my accomplishments or personal quirks.
I know.. I just don't feel like sharing those.
I'm sorry it sounds boring to you; I was really proud of that.
Yes. I felt good about listing it and making other people bored was not my intention.
That is what I was hoping, and you cannot know for sure that I won't. Being dismissed for such a statement is alright, although I wasn't considering that reaction.
"I care about the world, and I want other people to too". I don't feel the need to win the affections of others. I also don't think it is an adequate reflection of myself.. At least, not through a fun fact.
I understand the purpose of a fun fact and I am intentionally reject its merits by doing something unconventional that I find more useful.
I would not have done it if I didn't think it is useful. Maybe you can convince me otherwise, but you know how stubborn I am. Also, what merit would that have?
Convincing me to revise my fun fact.
I like that you are standing up for your belief in fun facts though! :P Or perhaps you have an ulterior motive.... I'm not trying to destroy fun facts. I just didn't feel comfortable sharing any other fun fact I came up with.
What do you think a girlfriend should be like?
In other words, what traits would you want in a girlfriend?
Thanks for answering that. I know it's quite a personal thing to share.. To share honestly,at least. Especially considering the person who is asking :P
Certainly not a desirable trait for anyone (hopefully).
Sure thing!
Do I fit any of your wants?
It sounds like many people could fit those traits. I'm surprised you say I do considering your list.. It sounds like you just need someone to keep you company?
I see.. Well there are plenty of people out there who can keep you company and like you and not have traits that you don't want!
Fantastic! I'll watch it after I finish my lab report ^-^
But important nonetheless if you sent it!
t won't take long to read!
Goodnight to you too! Are you asleep already?
Oh good!
I finished my lab report on time!
I'll go brush first too!. Sweet dreams!
I love you too!
Oh no! I took to long?. too*
Awww!. (:. I like it too!
You gave away the answer :P
I'm watching the trailer now..!. 3. 2. 1. play!. It's good !
Yes! Or we could read it together !. Too. I just started online!
It is verbatim to the movie, I'd say.. At least, so far.. The live action one.
I will get to reading!. Sweet dreams to you!
Thank you! Night night!. (:. He's electric!. Goodmorning!
I had a fantastic dream that had an ending!. We were fighting people!
Sort of like Dean and Sam in Supernatural!. It was awesome.
Oh, many times! You changed people's personalities  by covering their hair in colors, and sprinkles and glitter.. At one point I  had to throw cardstock like a frisbee to try and cut off the bad guys underworld henchman's head.
Our adopted parents (people who took us in) who sell hot tubs to celebrities (but only really have one client), died, so at the end of the dream, we were drifters.. I decided I like fighting with pokemon more than real fighting!
Oh no, it was quite scary and violent.
Yes. I am glad it had a happy ending!. The police came to handcuff the bad guys as we had them restrained, of course!. How was your sleep?
That's alright! Any time you have a dream, you should be happy ^-^
Those are different kinds of dreams, but you should be happy about those too!
I don't know it well enough to remember that part!
Oh! Thank you for helping me remember.. I finished The Little Prince.
It was good and unexpected. I think I would have trouble interpreting it, but maybe it is simply what it is.
Alright!
By the way, did you receive the protein powder?. It was delivered April 7th to 1615 Downey Street
Okay, good!
$22.52 after tax
Sure! Interest at a rate of 0.75% will be about $0.0046
No need to pay interest; I was just kidding, and letting you know that the interest would not have been much!
Talking to you is part of my day!
No.
I like this part from the book: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/26/79/06/2679069363f7c6d43235eeccfb3ea20f.jpg
Continuation: http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk39yjCcUy1qduvn6o1_500.jpg. The fox is speaking.. In the first one.
What does today hold for you?
It is still a mystery. I will finish some homework assignments first, then exercise and shower. Then I will go for a walk and do some reading in the gardens, or some other place. Then I hope to practice playing music. Sometime during the day I will eat food and tiny my room.
Are you going to visit the Street Fair today?
Oh! It is tomorrow.. Why not go alone, then? Or ask another.
Okay. But don't let that keep you from fulfilling your dreams!
I like spending time with you too!. There are times when I like to be alone too. Especially when I am practicing music.. Surely, there are times when you prefer being alone?. I am beginning to think you are an extrovert!
It just depends on what I am doing. Having you around all the time is great, but I feel like I am not being a good host when  I am just doing homework or playing guitar.. Why do you say you are always alone?. You are alone if you choose to be, and you can be not alone when you want. Do you feel like it is out of your control?
What sorts of efforts to you take to not be alone?
Maybe you could try to meet new people that way you could form new close friends to spend time with!. There are lots of people out there who would love to have you in their life : 3. I am sorry I cannot be there all the time.
Is making new friends something you would want to do, but don't know how? Or are you not sure where to find the right people?
I can't always be around for you, and I don't want you to have only two options of being alone or being with me, because that will surely lead to you being alone most of the time.
Better to have not at all if it can't be all the time?. have me*. Once you are out of college, you will have to go out of your way to find new friends (unless your workplace is huge and has many activities).  I recommend that you try and connect with some of the people you have met who you approve of.  If you haven't met with any of those people, you should explore new clubs, or go to events on campus. I'm sure there is at least one person you will really mesh with well studying at Radford!. well who is also studying*. Or do you already know all these things and are having trouble actually doing them, or for some reason don't want to?
It's never too late to go to club meetings, so long as you are able to track down where they are being held.. Maybe you need to go to different events!. People at art shows or plays are also rowdy?. There are tons of cool people at hackathons, but that would have to be more of a pen pal relationship, which is probably not what you are looking for.
http://www.radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/news/calendar.html/sand_art/3B18C3A1-DEDF-44EA-8929-6BADAE18F78D
There might be some cool people here.. And sometimes you have to be the one to start the conversation! (though I'm sure you do, I am just reminding you). http://www.radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/news/calendar.html/sand_art/3B18C3A1-DEDF-44EA-8929-6BADAE18F78D. Whoops :P. Or this! http://www.radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/news/calendar.html/earth_day_celebratio/601AAEE8-6726-493F-80F2-287D07396A65. People who take the time to plant a tree must be somewhat decent!. And free pizza.. https://www.facebook.com/groups/RUClassof2016/?fref=ts
You should make a post and ask if anyone who isn't an alcoholic would want to hang out some time!. Done with what?. Listening to suggestions from me when you didn't even ask for help?. I apologize, I just would like to help you not feel alone.
How so? I didn't even occur to me.. I am here for you, but if you still feel alone, then I am not enough.
If you will be happier overall, then I would prefer it.. You should have to be alone just so you can save all your time for me.
I do need you, but I am not dependent upon you to keep myself happy. I think that would be unhealthy.
I like who you are, and I like doing activities with you, and I like your ideas, but I am self-reliant.. Or I try to be, at least.. You are important to me, and you help me a great deal.
I do. Your underlying character and morals, your persona.. And all ideas should be questioned so that they may be refined. If I have ever discouraged you, I regret it.
Of course, you are irreplaceable. But if I cannot have you, I will not fall to pieces (I hope).. I like all of your graphic design projects!
I will always have criticisms of them, too.. No. You are you. You are unique to me.
No. I tried to recover something, or to put it to rest.. It should not be taken personally by you.
I was not trying to recover romantic interest. Just a friendship.
It can be personal regarding your reflection of me, but it should not affect how you view yourself.. Then I was in the wrong and did not consider any repercussions.
Part of why I like you is because I considered you very mature for your age. Please don't prove me wrong.
I apologize if I sound harsh. I don't mean to make you feel bad -- only to help you realize that we are talking about spilled milk.. There are plenty of reasons why he and I are not meant to be.
I understand these reasons and don't ever hope to be anything more to him than a friend.. Okay then, spilled milk that might turn into radioactive material if left unattended too long.
A good analogy, though?
What would you call it?. Help me understand. I try to be reasonable, but I can't see what you are trying to get out of this.. For me: I am trying to defend your opinion of me and also help you to not be so dependent upon others for comfort. Find happiness within yourself.
I understand you feel that way, but I am at a loss at what I can do now that the moment has passed besides not do it again.   What are your goals in telling me such?
No, I have rather effectively quelled my feelings toward him. Or at least they morphed into something else that doesn't resemble as much admiration as earlier.. Or are you worried about some new character intervening?. Are you trying to convince me of doing anything similar?. I am already convinced.
Truly, truly, I tell you.
I apologize, I meant to say that you are convincing me of not doing anything similar*. And have continued with that meaning.. Please let me know again what you hope to get out of this back and forth?. Again: I hope to help you feel less alone. And I also know I am walking on glass here since you might also be in a state of depression, which I am still very concerned about.
You have always been near and dear to my heart and will continue to be. I am not sure what convinced you otherwise.. I would not like your decision to be formed under false precepts.. Or neither of us would have any closure.. If you are discontented, tell me why, and we can try and fix it.. Perhaps your message said it all, in which case, I just need help interpreting it. I would like this to be more a two-sided thing though.
Sweet dreams !
Night night!. Good morning!
Thank you! How are you feeling?
But how are you really feeling? (You can tell me later, since you have to leave for class now or soon!). Have a nice walk!
No, I am wondering how your relationships are going, and whether you are dealing with daily activities well or if you are stressed about anything in your life.
I'm glad you are not stressed or worried! No burdens in your life?. Would you like to video chat with me tonight?
No, else I would not have asked! :P
Happy Earth Day!!
By appreciating nature just slightly more than usual! And yourself?
Did you do a good job of not stepping on them?
I may or may not unintentionally!. Good morning!

Ah, Peter... I am sorry, but I may need to visit some CVS's or Walgreens in Charlottesville tomorrow while you are visiting!
You are welcome to stay overnight if you need!. Also, there will likely be a terrifying amount of traffic due to graduation, so I could always take the bus instead of you having to drive!

You've got it, Peter! (:. Sweet dreams, Handsome!!

Hi!!. Are you free for skyping, by chance?
No!

Oh! When/where is that?
I would love to, so long as it is okay with your sister!. I am doing well! Glad to have had an awesome week!!!
And also glad to be coming home (:
Wow! Is that in Blacksburg? The street name sounds unfamiliar.
Hmm.. It says family OR plus one.... So that means one or the other!
I assume only graduates are invited, and the page is addressed to them.
Anyway, I'll just say No Thanks!
May I ask who is the host?
Good morning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. !~~~~~~~~!!!!!!!!!
Thank you! I found it!!. Hi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm good!! And yourself?. Hmm.. what is Gap's email?

Nice!
Thank you!. Would you like to spend time together aftewards?. afterwards*

I'll stop by on my way over!
Still want to come?!
Neat!!. Did you want to come to my house after and work in my room while I pack?
Sure!. And you can work on anything! But maybe find out what time your fitting is, just in case.. Any updates?
Hmm.. Okay.. Well I am okay running errands solo!. Is there an upper bound on the fitting time?. Or just a seconds bound*. second*
Oh cool!
(hug)
That's how it looks on my skype too. :P. All this time...
But I get the gist of it!

Awesome!!
Who were you remembering?
I slept very well! The bed is so comfy!. And that sounds like a nice service!
Remembering is good, like in the Book of Life!. You are so comfy already!!
But maybe if I bring you back treats, your comfy level will increase!. (like in Pokemon with Pokeblocks)
Or that!. :P. Wow, so cool!
They have chunky kit kats here!
I'm not sure which treat you would want the most...!
https://www.google.com/search?q=kit+kat+chunky+hazelnut&safe=active&rlz=2C1LENP_enUS0538US0550&espv=2&biw=1517&bih=716&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=TH5rVYWAM4KdugSCn4LoBA&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&dpr=0.9

Well I want to find something nice to bring to you!!
:P. Awww, silly...
Whoops :P. (:. Well I like this too!
Hmm... I had thought of a gift to give you, but I'd better ask first just in case.... Would you be interested in a .3mm pencil?
Yes!!?!!
Yes.. Would you prefer a nice .5 pencil? And two .3 pencils to try?. Things here are somewhat inexpensive compared to the U.S.
The pencils are about 2.25 RM. Aka... Less than a dollar U.S.!
What model is your favorite pencil?
Okay! I will try and find something, but most of the pencils I've seen so far are pentel.
Whoa, that's fancy!. And I like thinking about you (:. I will go get ready and let you get to more of your day!!. Sunrise is at 7am!

Thank you! (:. Enjoy the rest of your day (:
The pleasure is mine!
Hi Peter!!. Sweet dreams, Handsome ^-^. I love you!!!!!!!!!!
No swimming yet! I walked out on the beach and waded. I'm going to the pool next. We were at the breakfast buffet for a long time because it was huge and delicious.. :P
Whoa! Nice smiley!. Yes, ^-^ I will be at the beach as much as I can!
Whoa, I thought it was a panda dressed as a ninja!
:P hehe, noo.... So much more to do!
But they did have a good variety! Rainforest honey!!! And Japanese food too!
Nom : 3. I miss your voice!
May I call you tonight?. Skype call, maybe?!. What are you up to tomorrow?. I guess it would be morning for you.
Yay!. Okay!!
Neat!!. Oh yeah!! :P. Thank you.
Oh, did you get to cover the Nissan?
That's great! Thank you!!!!
I miss seeing your face too!. I need pictures!!. :3. Awww, you're looking really cute!
:P. But your legs are shrinking o.o
Yay!!
Sweet dreams, Cutie!!
Oh.. hmm.. :P. That can be arranged!
Aw ^-^
I think so!
(hug)
Sweet dreams to you (:
Hello!. :3. (hug)
I love you!! You are the best ever ^-^ !!!
Nice profile picture :P
And you!. Which makes it awesome!
It's you...!!!
The water was nice and warm!
And I didn't get attacked!
Aww, that bear is you after you get kisses!
The fishes were tiny! I didn't go out very far!
It was fun!! I can live underwater now O.O!
Yay!!
(:
Okay!!  Bear and bear?
Or Curse of the Werekitten?
Cat-morph power!
The first option sounds easier! But the second option would work well if the gameplay is story-mode!
Sleeping sounds nice for now!. (:. Tell me of your sleep!
That's awesome!. Comfier than usual?

Peter! There's like a whole million of things that I want to tell you. But mostly that you're so so so so amazing. I actually kind of miss you quite a lot. And your shirt stopped smelling like you. :/ (if that doesn't sound too creepy.) And I want to tell you that I love you and that I love being around you and that you make me the happiest ever and just.. everything. You're perfect.
Aw (: Ooh, and I just read the messages you sent wayy before, and it's scary that cross country sounded tough, but I'm glad you survived it. :P It's like you're um.. one of those people who eat nails for breakfast or something. :P And thanks for the nice college wishes. :P And I say that your level of perfectness is like.. soo perfect that calling you perfect wouldn't even justify your perfectness enough, so I'd have to call you amazing instead to counterbalance the impossibleness of someone ever using a word like perfect, just in case it could be overused and somehow become less perfect than the intentions of the word perfect.
:P like you.
I love you so so so much and my heart like wants to hug you or explode or something right now. :P. aw :P
As much as I'd love that, maybe seeing you could be a better solution. :P And speaking of returning your possessions.. I have a thingy for you~!. aw (:. a thing?

I really like how the 'o' is a heart :P. aw (: . well, there's always soon :D. I'm not at 'college' anymore :P

well you could always wish for that I don't know in about 25 minutes :P
You're right :P Aw, it's fine. If that's silly, then what I'm feeling is like absolute nonsense. :P
I started missing you so so so much a few hours ago, and now I don't think I can stop. :P
:P Or for longer than a second?. :P sorry. or for much longer than a second, like maybe forever? :P. sorry again
aw :P You're crazy amazing :D
You're like.. more amazing than possible :D. lol or so crazy you're amazing
:P Oh but you, you're like.. way off the charts. Both of them, actually. The amazing chart has you at like, 20 ft over the top; and the perfect chart has you sooo high, that you need one of those huge cherry pickers like the ones that firemen have to show how high up you are. The whole thing is really like a much more dramatic "Inconvenient Truth" flashback. :P
:P lol what. Psh, who does that? I was definitely talking about you.. like.. if you look in that long explanation of your perfection and amazingness, it has like, all the letters to spell out your name :P. yeah. That means it has your name all over it. Literally. :D. yeah, even the 'x'.. :P
oh, it's in there. :P. it's actually um.. marking the spot quite nicely.. :P
It's just.. so good at staying incognito :P. but yeah, that paragraph means you.
:P maybe it doesn't want to spell your whole name, because then it knows that you'll just leave when you find that last letter. It wants you to hang around more. That's how perfectly amazing you are :D. for some reason, my facebook thinks that all these messages are happening 2 seconds ago.. Man, we are some fast, mind-reading, conversationalists
aw.. :P I refreshed and it started showing correct times. it was really cool for awhilte though. :D aw. I know you're like.. all over my mind :P
Exactly what I mean! :P
oh no!! :P
I missed it too!. :P lol I should let you go too. It's all late now, all of a sudden. and I feel like you have to wake up somewhat early tomorrow :P
:P You're never ever a bother, Peter.. never ever ever.
like, even if you randomly came to my house in the middle of the night and like, threw stuff at the window. :P o. r like.. ate all the honey in my house
nah, :D you'd be the bestest ever no matter what.. besides the whole um. eating my family/ kicking puppies thing.. unless the puppy is a mini werewolf and it's trying to eat your toe.. :P
or a shadowlurker in disguise. . da skies. ahh, the letters you made are like.. perfect :P. I can't get over your amazing bark manipulating skillz. :P
soo perfect (: and you're the most fun ever. (: You wouldn't believe how much you make me smile :P. Sweet dreams, Peter. (: I hope cute little bunnies attack you instead of the shadowlurker.. aw.. they'd be so cute and tiny and fluffy and hopping on you while you sleep :P
lol :P just hope peacefully?. aww :D. I wish the sandman and tooth fairy were replaced by cute little bunnies. or maybe they can just shapeshift or something so they don't lose their jobs and get thrown into the tough world of unemployment. :P. sorry if that just doublesent :P. :3. :P lol walrus. You'd be a great sandman bunny :P
:P I hope your dreams are just as amazing :D. and y'know... just because you're all cute and cuddly and stuffs... :P
sorry :P
lol aw :P but would I have quite the same fluff-and-carrot/trix-loving-levels? :P . (: I really really really like you.
:P It's amazing :D. (: 
You're amazing too (: and I do too, but luckily, that can be easily fixed, hopefully. :P
psh, I can't be busy all the time. :P That would get terribly boring. 
If I am, then I'd just um.. get un-busy? :P. or something :P. but yeah :D goodnight. sorry for keeping you so long
:D Bye, Peter. (:. lol trust me, I'm not busy to begin with
Well that's crazy. :P Didn't you get that message that wound up talking about little sandman bunnies. that clearly meant that you could never ever be a bother. :P. but even still, you should get sleep and stuff. :D and so should the little bunnies.. :D. ttfn (:
yup, the most important (: 
I'm getting to sleep in a second though, and I'm suggesting they should too :D. :D
(: you're the best use of time ever. I wish you knew how important you were to me. (: I can still prove it though.. Goodnight Peter. (:
Bye (: Have a nice bright and sunny day tomorrow, even if it rains :P. :D see you soon hopefully
:D!!! ooh yeah :D sounds so cool!. Bye :D. lol I hope that Judy character is in it... :P or Toto maybe. bye :D. sorry
:D lol I'm sorry that I'm just getting that message that said you were sorry you just got those messages. :P Yeah. but have fun today. That Tom and Jerry thing still looks cool :P
I like websites that summarize textbooks :P. bulleted lists are a lot less intimidating than paragraphs. :P
lol :P noo, I'm totally unbusy. just um.. having to read textbooks :P. ooh, you too :D. (: You're so so awesome
:P not exactly.. Do we have to read that textbook?
I thought it was just to like.. use in our weightlifting regimine or something :P

well, like.. I do :P but it didn't work. unfortunately
yeah, right?. in lowercase with no spaces?. :P
it's cool, I'm fine being a guest all year :D
as long as they don't kick me out or anything. yeah :D. I could be some person in Texas following along with some teachers course. :P
free learning :D
oh wait, we get that anyway
a lot? o.o. hmm, are Mrs. Coston's tests tough?
Does studying require you to read all the chapters in the textbook, because she hasn't exactly given out reading assignments yet..  And I like talking to you :D . aw.. sorry about the duck pond thingy. maybe it won't rain anymore and it'd be safe to go :P
ohh, okay that makes more sense :P I wish she would read it for us aloud in class. :D and yeah, but getting stuck in the rain is always fun. too
yay :D
It sounds like bunches of fun (:
:D well if you wouldn't want to be alone... I'm always here :D. and up for adventure :P
aw, but I'll always have homework :P. maybe.. I hope not. :P Maybe I'll finish really quickly and be done by um.. 4 :D. not that you'd want to wait or anything.. ah, there's always some other day then, right?
I like seeing you :D
or perfectly normal :D
awesome :D I hope so. And thanks :P bye Peter!

lol ninja birds are plenty freaky right?. and you're not at all :D
nope :D. yay, all I technically have left is Mrs. Coston's worksheet thingy :P. Does she give the exact same homework every year?
oh yeah, I love looking at Maps and stuff :P. I wish there was GSP on this thing though :P
um.. yeah :P that.. lol I don't know what GSP is.. but GSN is the gameshow network :P
it's fine :P

aw.. what happened last night?. well, in your dream, I mean
aw :/ . It does just sound like a dream, because there's no way I wouldn't be 100% peachy keen on seeing you :P
I'd be keen on seeing you either way :D
:D
I finished the worksheet :P
so crazy :P. I thought I'd be working on that thing till tomorrow
exactly :P. maybe tomorrow on the bus or something.. it'd be awfully dramatic. I'd make the final punctuation right when the bell for class rang
Very very :P My hand would probably pass out from how close I was cutting it
:D it does sound nice. lol :P nice pun there, by the way
:D :/
I am, but my mom doesn't think I am :/. I asked about two hours ago, and she said I could if I finish my homework.. :/ how confusing

Me too :/

and i'd like to see you anyway :D. From not letting me do anything
If I've heard her correctly
i am :P I just feel bad that I told you the first thing already. I'm really sorry. :/

:/
I do want to though :/
I'm sorry :/

:/. Do I?

you make everything a million times better.. And you're still the best motivation for homework
yeah.. you're amazing.
:D. I would.. Even if I wasn't a wouldchuck. :P. and if you wanted to.. I'm sorry :/
I'm still sorry though

lol :D Tom and Jerry
I could just like, go bike over to you or something :D

lol you heard about that. you're so so soso so os so so so amazing :D!!. I just um.. broke into my house
:P It's very scary o.o I didn't think I could do it. But I gotta stop forgetting my key. lol that'd be funny if right when I got through the window, I realized my key was in my pocket. how'd you know about tall towers? o.o
o.o whoa. lol and this time it's not for forgetting to bring a textbook back or something :P. :D! I wanna get my name on the board in Cafe de Bankok
August 28th I believe :p. I'm not positive though, because that seems like a Sunday... And who eats hot wings on Sundays?. is that like.. against religion? :P
lol don't they practice religions too?. sorry :P
:3. I hope robotics is a bunch of fun for you :D. I bet Trey and Joel will be there :P. maybe not actually... but.. hmm :P
oh no :(. do you know anyone else in it?
:D!!! That's sounds sooo fun
:P lol only because the ducks like people in pairs better than when they're all alone :D
I think they like you (: especially for all the times you poked them. now they miss you..
I'm sorry :( my computer just logged me off
yay :D fixed it. it was a weird "restart for updates" thing :(. And ducks could miss you :D! plus me. even though I'm not a duck :(

Pineapples are pretty awesome :D. And you shouldn't doubt your amazingness :D. aw :( I gotta go to the post office really fast
Good luck with robotics if that happens :D

YEAH!. whoa.. Caps are scary :P. That's why I don't go to baseball games. *ba dum chh**. sorry :P
you're quite cool :D. And satellite dishes are veryyyy sturdy
Not at all (: They're amazing. And you are too cool :D. Need I compare you to a cooler again? :P
:P They make great popscicle holders though :D
Definitely no what I meant :P . I love talking to coolers :D
it is o.o. but not if that cooler is you. because you're even cooler than a cooler :D. Whoa! I was totally in shock when I found out that the Catcher in the Rye guy went to a mental institution o.o
Whoa o.o!!. wait, where? or why?. or can I see you? :D
:P lol no fair
but it sounds fitting. yay :D. you're like.. a ninja turtle, and then a ninja o.o it's crazy
:P lol ninjas have very tight schedules, I've heard
:D!!! yay!. I'm excited :D But how will I see you?. like.. if you're still being all ninja?
:P I hope I can catch you as a ninja :D. And yes :D. I wonder how many ninjas there are lurking outside on a regular basis o.o
I know!! o.o
!!!! whoa.. no way :P. but like.. if I'm talking to you... !! unless it was all wireless and sneaky. what if you were right here, right now. I wouldn't even know it!
:P
:P lol that makes me feel a little better then. :P oh yeah, pretty sneaky especially since I don't know anything about it :P
You're an awesome ninja :P I'm glad you found out where robotics is :D
aw :/ But you're the most un-lame person I know!. And I should let you get yours done too :P
Whoa! multi-tasker :D. or just a lot of free time?
:D that's good And you don't fail at being a ninja at all :D. I'll miss you too, so I'll try to see you :D
:D Anything you give me is amazing
And you're the lame at all
ooh, it is :D
22 is a nice number (:. it's like.. a pair of swans :P. being all together and stuff. And okay :D have a bunch of fun at robotics!. nice talking to you
!!!! (: lol you should be a ninja more often. :P Not one of the invisible ones though.. :D see you today! . ooh, and I'd like to wish you a late goodnight :P since I couldn't do it on here last night. Are you favoring doorknobs or elephants today? :P
:D I did. And turtles are quite awkward. That one in particular.. Whoa, you were ninja just then? o.o!
I like the note :D. whoa, but how so?
:D!!! That's so cute!!. :D. I wanna go find it
if it's like usual, then that means it's ammmmmaaazing :D
ahh that's so cool!! :D how did ducks do that?. thank you (:. aw.. :( I'm sorry you had to walk
lol :P bribing the ducks
I bet you were all quiet again, right? :P
aw, well you're good at being ninja anyway :P. because I don't think that was there when I went out to check mail awhile ago. unless i just didn't notice :P
I'd say like.. around 6:30 :P I think I just didn't notice
crazy!! I should've checked mail then and timed it all nicely :P
and it would've been awesome!~
but seeing you is amazing :D aw, thanks. It was coolish. little kids are nice
yeah :D
aw :( I was afraid that'd happen. but did the weather help? :D. it was all nice outside :D. like you (:
oh no :( You're right. maybe that's not best for walking. did I make you miss your bus? :/. I just realized that I might've :/. I'm sorry for that
:/ well I'm sorry anyway.
How's your schedule look?
awesome :D
I know a guy who's taking 10 classes o.o. wait.. I mean 11. It makes me feel a little better about the number I have :P
yes :P. and robotics
I mean, It sounds accomplishing, but i'd say that only a select few could have the motivation to do it :P. Whoa. there are some of those?. it could've copied wrongly :(
that happened on my iPod too. you can delete anything if you need to :P
:D!! which one?
I'm sorry I didn't get to test all of them from your Zune :P
:P You're welcome, sorry for the sad or nonplaying ones though
what, me? :P. You're the amazing one.. (:. crazy amazing..
don't be sorry for everything.. everything you do is like.. more than perfect. I can't even describe it :/ you're just sooo amazing. Did you see the weird "X" song? 
it's soooo weird :P
whoa o.o. lol :P I do know that song though. I'm sorry :P I just like that one part..
lol :P!!. pretend most those songs aren't from me :P. only a few
:P I wish I had known how to make a playlist... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjUX2LESOpM It's soooo weird but I like it :P
lol :P !! yay :D I'm glad you like those. :P I like your superman one better though
psh, I'm sure you had the idea in your head way longer
they're only so many famous guys who hang out in telephone booths :D
lol :P It doesn't mean anything that I know of. I just thought it sounded like... crazy.. and cool. . :P
whoops :P I never know. and that happens anyway :P. I don't know if the song explains it well enough though
how you make me feel :P. like.. heart skipping stuff. double dutch looks crazy hard :P
:P You'll find out. for now, I gotta go drive :P. sorry to leave you at a cliffhanger
hey, I showed you this one song before, but you know what the 4th step in throwing a basketball is? :P yeah..  Thanks for stuff :D (:. and I'll try to stay doorknobby :P. on those dark country roads. byebye :D. (: sorry for the cliffhanger again
lol of course not :P. bye :D. and okay. I'll try
I really really like you too Peter (:. bye
I loved them :P
(: Bye
!!! I haven't seen that either :P. ooh, but um.. doorknob. I saw a deer run across the road though. I was all like.. "Oh, deer!". :P. yeah :D I'll see you tomorrow. (:. You really are super duper amazing. (:
!! oh no, I missed your call :(
It was so sad, I checked and I was all like.. a missed call from you
whoa, there were barks?. !!!
I want to hear your voice too :P. aw :(. I'm sorry I missed it
:P lol you're so good at that
What? :P awww. I should really go outside more often late at night
you're pretty special (:
I'm not a good judge of luck, but you're always pretty lucky anyway :D
it's outside?. wait, brb
awwww (:. best cat drawing ever
(: lol just the first thing I saw.. but aw (:. I love it.
I say it's about as special as special gets (:. psst.. Peter?
are you anywhere near a phone?
:D!!!. ahh, I gotta go, but do you think I could call right after I log off?
yay (:. :D Bye for now. and thank you sooo much for the note (:
You're amazing Peter (:
(: Talk to you really soon :D. bye!
Hi :D. aw :/ No one should have an awful day... especially not you.. and that typo correction is way off :P, if you don't mind my saying. but I hope it looks up, and I hope you got your pictures too :D. I gotta go for now, but I still hope your day gets better. I might have to send over some bunnies if not. :P
I don't feel like I've done anything right though :/. You're really awesome Peter. :D
I really think you are. Like, I know you are :D
you are. :D but ooh, How did your photographing adventure go?
whoa. I heard the storm start pouring all over and I was really hoping you had gotten home already. :P And finished duck pond activities. . I'm sorry about that :/ It wouldn't help the project since it's due tomorrow, but I know for sure that it won't rain every single day--so plenty of days for pictures? :D
:/ aww, is it from all the rain? That stuff can be really cold sometimes. :(  . And I most definitely care :D
sorry, I can stop saying it so often.. but I do. I'll always always care, even if you'd say it's just something silly or something that doesn't matter. 
no sarcasm over here though.. I mean it. :D
Oh whoops. :/ ah, I'm sorry
I'm really not good at that
Don't be sorry :D 
It's fine, whatever it is. 
aw :/ what hurt?. was it those bunnies I sent over? :P. sorry :/ 
I unfortunately, don't have enough :/ Aw.. I'm sorry I'm so bad at helping. Or even noticing that stuff hurts. :/ what was it though?
Walked away like, on the way to Kipps? :/
:/ I'm sorry for 10 minute break. and after school.
I never know what to do though, and I wouldn't want to be rude or anything about it :/
but how? :/ 
aw, I didn't know I walked away the first time.. I think I forgot that your class wasn't by Mr. Kaylor's room..
yeah, I realized that when I noticed you weren't there :P . English and stuffs.
It's like, right when I saw you, he caught up with me.. and then when I was heading over to see you after school, he started talking to me :/ And it's bad to just leave when someone's talking, especially since I've skipped out on him so much.
And I don't know how to explain that I like staying and talking to you like.... without him there. Because if he doesn't take hints, then I'd have to tell him outright, and I don't know how to tell people to basically 'go away.' :/ It just sounds mean no matter what. i don't know :/. I'm sorry
And I don't want to make you feel bad either the mostest :/ . :( I'm really really really sorry
:/ I think it is. And you deserve everyyyttthing. well, everything that you want at least. And everything that's good in life. :D
you deserve all of that though (even though I wouldn't consider those part of everything that's good in life. :P) And you being there is the best thing ever for just about everyone :D
Well you deserve it anyway :/ I'm the only thing in the way of it all
:/
:{D  <french guy? . And because you're amazing :D
:/. ah, I don't want to leave like this, but I really really have to study for a few biology opportunities tomorrow :/ . I'm sorry.
It's definitely not more important
just something I have to do :/
You're wayyyy important
you're like.. more important than the sufurhydroxl group, which keeps structures stable :P. lol (improv studying?)
I think you are. :/ and that's only my fault
you too :D and thanks.
G'night Peter. :D (: You're the bestest
Cats are fun :D. And you're fun :D
and cookies are fun?. especially with milk?
well you shouldn't have to ask, at least :/
It's something I should do anyway :/ I'm just not good at it
And it's fine :D. you're nice to talk to anyway (:
or just one of many crazy amazing things that make you Peter. (: 
You're pretty amazing, I have to say :P
And okay, but have a really nice night. And I'll try more. 
I'd do anything. :/ And I could stay a little longer if you wanted
It's fine, it's the weekend soon anyway
can I call by chance?
:/ could I just call for a second?. just to say stuff, at least
aw, yay :D. I'm sorry
ah, the laptop's about out of battery, so I'll go upstairs and call you in approximately 2 minutes. :P. sorry. silly of me
sorry. aw. (:. thanks..
talk to you really really soon. I hope
:D but fo sho. :D  I won't be too ninja on the phone. :P but then again, you're the ninja one. bye :D for now
awww :'( that does matter. Are you alright?
:/ are you sure?. :( I'm sorry
:'( what happened?
oh :/ That's terrible :( any reason why?. and trust me, it matters. a bunch
it does :( 
:/ Do you need someone to talk to?
like on the phone or in person or something?
are you positive? :/
That doesn't sound all that positive :P
:/ but why were you sad?. And where was I?
:(
I'm sorry :( and maybe just in a hurry to see you :/ I'm really really sorry
I should've been there, especially if you were sad at the time too :(. I'm still sorry.
I always want to see you. :/ I'm sorry I wasn't there
:/ I should've been there anyway. 
Even if I'm a letdown, at least the weather isn't..
:/ I think I am.
well thanks :/ 
don't be sorry, you're amazing Peter. . 9;. (:*. :P shift bar..
:P am I allowed to say jinx then/. ?*
:P um.. jinx. :D. :v
:P technically, but no one ever collects. I think it's just something you say 
:P lol and if you do it all ninja-like, it'll be like spontaneously appearing soda :P
lol :P you don't have to be, it's a crazy long walk :P . I actually gotta go down to Gobblerfest in a second :(
wait :( aw.. :'(. what's the tissue for?
:(
near a phone?
:/ . bye
!! You the best ever (:!!! And you make me so so so so so happy. :D I hope you have a great day too and I hope doctor who works out :P. You're amazing (:. bye for now (:. When I woke up this morning, I was like, still smiling from earlier today :P (: I really really like you. :D
Aw :D I wanna say again how much I like your smile (:. And the ring thing is crazy :P. and I'm not busy at all
:P From my perspective, yours is most definitely the one I'd rather see (:
lol :P What are you implying? :D 
:P I want to see you smile too. (: It's one of the eight wonders of the word, I'd say. :P. lol :P!! It's like a girl smiley now. (:8
(:|] this one's the boy?. (:|} and this one's the german WWI soldier :P. You're so so amazing (:
!!! :D Yeah! Doctor Who!! Aw, I do believe I've received the worst news ever just a second ago though :/   lol :P And you could still see that if you really want. It's very amateur though. And has bad audio.
Nooo, not at all. . I kinda got myself in trouble. It wouldn't be bad, but it means that I can't see the guy who has my heart :/ And that's just about the saddest thing ever.. especially since I have a dare to complete. :P
I just didn't ask my mom if you could stay. :/ It's not your fault at all though. :D It's fine, but I still have'ta do that dare.. :P
It's okay, I didn't want you to leave either. :P . And I loved talking to you (:
(: . You're amazing! :D 
And don't feel bad at all :D . lol :P Google never fails. . But I wouldn't watch it without you. :P 
if I want :P
I was so set on fishsticks and custard though. I don't know if watching it without it would be the same. . or without that Peter guy... :P. lol there is always next week though, I'd suppose.
I wonder what's up with River Song. o.o Was she like.. pregnant with Amy or something? :P. lol. :D ooh yay! new episodes
oh whoo. ps. :P. Doctor who-oops.
:D
:D!. aw :/ Well I like the songs you post :D
!! You were gonna post the same song? :P
:D lol I put that on there just for you. :P
:D I like all your links.
And no :P I know. :P lol my know was not in response to that last thing by the way. my 'I know"*. :P And that's nice (: It's crazy to like all my everything though. :P 
Everything you do is soo easy to like though. :D
:P !!! I'll make you a playlist fo sho so you know :P And don't that you're not good enough. Because most of those songs aren't special at all- just nice songs. :P And more than good enough. (: Aw :D I'd love anything you put on there. even screamo or something.
I'd listen to it all :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQESZszV0Sg. :D
(: aw.  that one is special too. :P If you noticed. even if it sounds sad
awww. I didn't? :P lol I was searching for nothing I guess
:D!! yay!!
:P Aw :P You're amazing (:. :P lol I think it's supposed to be a children's song, but it's all nice, like you :D. (:. I'll never let you fall..
:P
like 1, 2 ,3?. :P lol I like all these cheesy lines. 
And I already caught you :D 
:P lol now if only I could catch all these butterflies flying all in my tummy
:P you're better than the butterflies (: And I guess it does feel rather nice
:P you're right, when I'm with you, I have both :P. but butterflies aren't very good conversationalists... :P
:P lol are you training butterflies over there in the art of English?. they're really good at making butterfly noises though.. "butterfly!"
:D!! aw (: It's nice
lol "And so the cameo bow becomes a purposeful wing.". awww :P. Well it is a nice song :P
noo :P You're better than good for me (:. don't listen to those guys who claim to be as tall as lions :P
lol :P yeah.. I guess the secondhand lion wasn't even as tall as the boy... but what about when they're standing. And you're better than I've ever imagined already. (: I feel the same about you though. hmm, how do you feel about the Sum of 20 and 21?
ah, okay :P lol it's fine. 
I think I might like the lyrics more than the band :P . but it's a good band too :D. Whoa.. that song :D from spanish
:D wait, say the something. because it does matter (:. You matter. and everything you say does :(. (:* :P. lol whoops.
I do :P
Aw...! Are you kidding though, you were the best ever. (: And you still are. . But I'm glad I could cheer you up (:
aw :(
(:. Well I'll always care.
(: aw.. You make me so happy too. :D And me making you happy made me happy :P I guess I didn't know I was making you happy at the time though. :P. I thought you seemed happy too :D
And you always said the awesomest things ever.. aw (: Well I hope I never ever break your heart ever ever. I won't, and I'm sorry if I ever did :( 
:/ but I shouldn't have. I didn't think it would hurt.. I thought you'd just kind of move on. It's silly though, because I'm the one who couldn't. 
forget about you, though truly, I never had any intentions of it. 
:( . wait.. :P fell where?
aw :( And that's terrible. :( No one should ever ever ever break you. And I'm so sorry :/ 
:/  You're more than good enough. (: I can tell you over and over and over and I'll still mean it
I still remember really clearly.. when I said all the stuff I did :/ I can't remember the words exactly, but I remember where I was and :/ ah, I'm just so so so sorry. 
These are the most cliche words ever, but I do mean them.. I'll never ever let you down like that, ever.
I think I told you a story :/
:( 
I don't :/ but I know it'd kill me if I did. Just seeing you sad is the worst.. but if I did it... :/ . I don't ever want to let you go.
:/ The worst thing I've ever done. . you know that one day... when we watched that movie with that guy in it about time? :/
lol :P noo, the other one. like, recently... oh hey, I remember that too though :P
and popcorn.. and you. at Twe's house. I think I was really nervous.. but I meant the 1027 hours.. and what I said after it. :/
Oh yeah, I should be less vague. but I regretted all that stuff  right when I said it. :/ and I was suggesting all the things I didn't want. :/ And sometimes I think that's what happened when I did it the first time :/ just regret, everywhere.  I remember you were really good at quoting everything. :P. And now I remember all the parts :P
:/ I thought I was too, and I don't know what would've happened. :( I knew that if I didn't do anything though, nothing would've been the same. And I couldn't've managed a change like that. :/ I couldn't handle making you sad like that either. I really just want you to be happy, as irrelevant as it sounds.. I think I was thinking about the um.. K thing :/ but I'm so caught in love with you, Peter. I can't imagine anything or anyone else. I love you.. I love you soo much.. sorry
:D!! I was just listening to that.. And thanks (:. I'm never gonna leave. (:
aw. :/ I really did miss you. Seeing you and talking to you. I remember that. I kind of thought you like.. hated me. :/ Not that you could ever hate anyone. I remember being too scared to facebook message you in case I bothered you.. And I'll never ever leave or give up. I really like you, Peter. (: 
:( aww. I'm so so sorry. I think I just kept poking you, because I was too scared to say 'Hi', and if you poked back I always got so excited. :P . lol you wouldn't believe it :P me just waiting on pokes :P. from you
lol nothing to be sorry for (:
me on the other hand, I gotta keep making it up. (:  Aw :( It's okay. But why?
Aw :( I'm sorry! I never knew that's what I was doing :/
You're the best, Peter.
aw, I remember when the little green circle showed up next to your name, I got soo nervous. That still happens though. :P Just now I can say "Hi" and not be as worried.  :/ and I'm sorry. :( Maybe it's like one of those Taylor Swift songs.. if I could ever explain it.
And I wasn't picking anyone :/ I guess I was just  explaining why.. because if I was really with someone, I shouldn't be having crushes on other people. I just wish I had known earlier how it would play out, or known that letting go of you was the worst choice. :/ Aw :/ . You're the greatest. I know for sure.. And I'm sorry :/ I think last year's homecoming was when I talked to you for the first time in awhile. I should've asked you to dance..
I was :/ I should've waited till' the last slow song though.
aw.. I wouldn't've believed you if you'd told me that a year ago. :P And Joe and I just went as friends, if it matters. . ah :/ I'm so so lucky to have you. After everything especially... I'm so sorry, Peter.. You're amazing. (:. And sorry, I'll hold on :P
but you're totally photo bombing? :p. oh... aw.. :P. it's crazy, because I had just walked by that spot a few minutes after you
:/ aw. I'd say that you should've asked :P but I guess you weren't really in a position to :/ Maybe I should've asked you instead :P would you have believed me if I told you I'd thought about it? aw :( thinking about all the times I've made you sad.. I'm so so so sorry :( Like, if I'd ever known.. :/ ah, I don't know..
I was thinking about what to say. I always trip up though.. (: . And how amazing you were, of course..
:/ It's okay, you were nice for ever talking to me at all after what I did. . ah, I'm so so sorry
I never got over the feeling that I got when I used to talk to you.  aww. :P I'm sorry about that
:P You should've seen how excited I was when I found out about Roots & Shoots.
:P ah, I'm sorry about that too.
aw (: Well I'm so so glad. And I'm glad I had a tendency to stalk you :P Because letting go would've been terrible.. aw :D! . It's Sumthing special :D
:P lol and there's 40 kinds of sadness when you're gone..  :P . nothing for 39 though :(. (: You have me convinced
that I could never ever be without you now. Not like back then.
(:. You're soo amazing (:
It's fine, I can never agree with it when you say things like that either. :P Just as long as you know that I mean it.. 
Sorry, I'll let you finish that though :D. thought*
aw :( Well I'm sorry I ever broke your heart to. I think you're so so so sooo amazing though!. And I'm sure they did too, they probably just couldn't believe you liked them :P
Or they were crazy.. because that's the only way they couldn't like you. (: 
A perfect, amazing, and sweetest guy ever
aw, I'm sorry to have met you sophmore year then.
I like the way you are now (: . but I don't like that you've had your heart broken :(. And I don't like that I contributed to it..
But I can spend time making it up, right? (:
whoa. That's tougher than a place like Kentucky :P. I'm sorry, Peter :(
aw :( 
It's weird, I feel like my elementary school was the only one where no one ever 'dated' :P. because no one ever did..
:P I was so confused in 6th grade. I guess I mean like.. no one liked each other either. or not like that..
it sounds cute anyway :P
especially if it involves you. :P And doesn't everyone have cooties at that age?
lol I still imagine all the relationships are the same from 6th grade.
:P lol yay!! legos!. I wish I had more
:( but why?
aw :( getting in trouble with like.. teachers?
ohhh. :( aww. 
I'm sorry. :( did you have like.. Ms. Disolvo or something?
ohhh sorry, I think I heard that before.. And Vestal? 
o.o whoa. I've never heard his voice before.
It does sound scary though.. aw :( 
Teachers should encourage goofing off :P
That makes sense, he was probably mortified that he made you be all quiet :( . ooh ooh, I like the quiet kid :D!
I couldn't say the same in 6th grade though, I was way too shy :/
but I should've talked to all the quiet kids :P
aw :( I became unshy because of 8th grade. I'm sorry though, that sounds bad :(. :D yay! openess
like windows that are all painted shut... but you found a sharp thing, and got the paint out?. :P. wait.. sharp things sound bad. found a um.. contracter. :D there.
fix-it person maybe... aw, I know.. I never really knew any 8th graders in 7th grade..  none of the grades got together. . I remember you grandfather though. :P
that was one of the first things I remembered when I heard your last name :P
lol I hope that wasn't weird... "Wasn't your grandfather in the military?" :P
Crazy stuff. You have some great things to say though (: But Aw :( no two people are ever the same.. It's like, how you can't judge all guys by just one not-nice one?  :( You're sooo good enough though
no, I like hearing it (:
just know that it wasn't your fault. Even though I didn't know what happened, I know you well enough to say that.  aw (: well I'm glad I bumped into you.. And maybe my being open helped me meet you. Because I know that in 7th grade I wouldn't even think of saying 'hi' to random people :P
well I'm glad I said Hi first to you (:. :P I wonder what you were thinking..
lol "What's this random freshman girl doing?". you never messed anything up (:
You messing stuff up is impossible, trust me (:. and even if you did, I'd know you wouldn't mean to. 
You're so amazing (: . I feel like you don't have to try.. You're naturally perfect (: 
aw :(. I wish I was there.. Maybe I should talk to you in person about this stuff, so I can be there.
Like you always are.
(:. I'm not  going anywhere.. lol, it's like.. "but brb, I gotta go eat dinner." :P kidding, of course. 
:P I don't
aww... :P you're so warm though
(: I wish I could help you get warm :P but for now, all I can suggest is a really nice soft blanket. like one of those um.. microplush ones
yay :D. That's good. Now I want to tell you silly things about my life :P I guess there'll be time for that though
me? :P
do ya know what made you think that?
aw (: I don't know how I'd describe myself, but that's nice of you to say.. I care about you so so much. (:
what's weird is.. I never called him my boyfriend :/. I was kind of scared to.
:/
no, boyfriends are nicer. :/ 
It's not what I meant..
:/ I'm sorry..
I could tell you all this stuff, but it wouldn't do any good at all.
I like your story though :D. It's so nice (:
I mean, it's nice hearing about you... it's a sad story though :( but it's nice that you're you.. 
me too :(!!. just one though.
:( aww.. You sound so nice..
:( It sounds terrible. :(. it is terrible. :(. :/
I blame me :( It's never ever your fault.. that'd be impossible.
espcially with something like this... I really really like you as my boyfriend (: 
(: I'm positive I'm not the only one who cares though. but if you are trying, it's working. :P I love just you though. and I think you're so so so amazing. And I don't think you should blame yourself at all. It was all me :/ . And you can't mess it up (: 
aw :( 
(: I love you.. And I won't ever leave unless you want me too.. Pink promise. (:. pinky*
(: Then I won't (:
Call me self-destructive, but I couldn't either.. And when I realized it I thought I was too late :/. I was so surprised like.. in february... Someone asked me if you had 'asked me out' yet.. and I was sooo soo surprised. they might've been exaggerating, but they said that you liked me for a long time, and that 'everyone knows' (that second part might definitely be exaggeration.) But that just knocked me out because I couldn't believe it. :P Hearing it from you before that was even better though. All that time, I thought I was the one who liked you, I had no idea the feeling was reciprocated. :P . sorry
the most recent one :P
:P oh yeah, I bet. . just like the sea lion conspiracy of 84'..
Everyone knows that Flippers was a seal and not a sea lion.. :P. aw (:
(: it's crazy, because I liked to you so much too. :D And I thought you were swell when we met. :P  And now, I'm so in love it feels impossible almost. It's the happiest feeling ever. (: And It makes me feel so so so so lucky. I just don't want to lose you. 
And I'll try so so so hard not to.
(: You're like proof that the world can be amazing. 
:P sorry for the clicheness. (: lol that last bit sounds like a song. (: . but yes. :D. And I wouldn't change anything.. except maybe not breaking your heart. :(
ahh :P! It is a song!. it's umm... Relient K? :P. wait... I think :P. yeah.
(:. I won't let go. (: And you'll always be my best friend. :P
:P And I must've done something right to have you..
(:
aw :/ I'm sorry.. You're already my first something though (:
(:
(: ah, I'm so so so glad I have you. And sooo lucky (:
I can't imagine who wouldn't want you. (:. you're sooo much more than I've ever imagined.
I wouldn't want to imagine that.. it's crazy thinking about all the stuff you know about me that no one else does. I feel like you know me better than anyone. (:
(: I'd love to hear anything else. And there's plenty of time to find out.. :P . (: And it's an honor.
(: I love being able to talk to you. I trust you so so much (: And I love you being happy.. And I love you so much, Peter. (:
I wouldn't believe you, but I do, because I know I feel exactly the same way about you. (:. Everything about you.. (: . All of it is perfect (:
(:!!. You're soo amazing (:
:P And I'm telling you you're amazing (:. soo amazing. even if you're silly (:. because you can be both
Silly can be a good thing (: 
(: You make me feel perfect. Even though I know for sure I'm not.  
I had sooo much fun yesterday and this morning with you (:. lol :P soo much to name though..
(: . I still think you're just getting me confused with you :P. You're soo perfect (:
:P Maybe I rather not be negative.. But I don't like when I say the completely wrong, random things in situations and everyone just kind of looks at me funny. I never know what to say at the right time :P
I'm glad :P I think Andy would know what I mean... :P lol I can never talk to that guy. . (: but thanks.. You're _so_ perfect.
That's crazy :P but thanks :P
If only my mom thought so too :P
especially not moms :P
lol :P Your mom sounds so cool though 
:P
Well they've talked to each other before.. maybe they planned it :P. I haven't been around your mom enough to know though :P
lol ti's cool :P. it's*
:P!!. funny that that would've worked too. old english is the best
ah, I should let you go, shouldn't I? 
(: aw
It sounds so special already, just coming from you I know it's special (:
I'm soo glad I know you. Your heart is amazing... (: And you already know it.. but I love you so much too. . hmm, were you listening to Campus yesterday?
:P lol it's pretty head-bobbing too.. . ah, they all are
lol noo :P I do have Vampire Weekend, you know?
This one album? :D ma. maybe I should borrow it again..*?
:P aw. What band?
Whoa? with the longdistance guy?. but who.. I didn't know you had a band :P. is that the one about kite-flying?
Nice name by the way :P. I did (:
kites and bikes?
It doesn't sound unoriginal :D. I like it
I think I may have :P 
If it was, I didn't notice. (: It must've been amazing.. I probably thought it was a real band or something.. That's how amazing it way.. was*
:P I don't just say stuff. (:
(:. Oh, I do.. Soo, where can I hear this amazing song again? :P
aww :( You need to put it on iTunes or something :P to share your greatness. or at least so I can get a better listen :P. I can wait though. :D
:D!!. I love your singing (:
It's perfect (:. noo, I love it (: It makes me feel all warm inside. "I was following the.. I was following the pack..". (:
:P ah, I'm really not singer though.. I'd be like, the voice of an angel with only a mere mortal. :P lol sorry to say cheesy stuff like that
but even if you're not an angel, I do really like your voice (:. lol :P oh yeah, we were really tearing it up
I think I was hearing applause from my neighbors.
:P . Maybe I can sing something you actually know :P
:D!!!! No way, I really like your voice (:
:D!! that's like, the coolest thing ever. I wanna hear your song again :P
:P psh, I thought you had a perfect record on expert Mr. Amazingvoice. (:. Thanks though :P. lol I loved playing rockband with you
(:!!! Aw (: They'd probably think it's amazing like I do (:. (: I'd never guess that. but guess what? :D
(;. (:*
(: Bye. You're way way cooler :P
you keep water at like the perfect drinking temperature. :P. you have fun too :D. bye bye (:
(: Sweet dreams, Peter. I really really like you too (:
I'm the lucky one. :D Besides being stuck at home again--Maybe I'll just knock out all of Ms. Coston's homework or something. :P Have bunches of fun doing stuffs though. :D post-script: I like the wall post (: Thanks for that.. I hope your day is *_AMMMMAAAZING!!_*. And I don't use bolded, capitalized, underlined, repeating-letter phrases lightly, either. :P . (: Bye for now. Actually, the 'amazing' looks a little scary... So I'll just say, "I hope your day is amazing (:"  Yeah. Ttfn. I really like you (:
aww I'm sorry :P I was really scared it was someone else. You're so so cool though and I'm keeping it (:. Can i still be yours?. :/. Or something cheesy like that? :P Sorry, I hope everythings going awesomely :D And um, bye for the time being
aw (: really?:. ?*
because I do want :D
Of course (: if you want... :P. (:. Because I'll always want that
I like your 'a's and 't's :P
oooh, I still have that something to give to you too :D!!
because people will like your handwriting too much?. I like yours more than the way I write :P
I like your note :P because it's by you. (: You're so so so amazing
Me too! :P . of course, after I add the stuffs to it
It's sooo far to walk though :P
I'd be completely okay with that otherwise :D because it'd mean i get to see you
robotics :D!. if only I wasn't out of the way
:D!
(: lol thanks. (: aw, are you sure the gremlins won't be out by then? o.o. I don't want anyone getting eaten here... especially not you :D
I sooo want to see you (:
Maybe it's because it's over Facebook. :P. (: You're so so cool!!! :D!!. It'd be impossible for me not to see you. :D. not to want to*. I think some words missed my fingers :P
I was thinking too fast for them. :P
aw (: i think you're amazing.. And it's very fine. :P I guess I was just basing it off past experience. lol it's really only happened once before though
no, it's fine. (:!! It's amazing like you (:
aw.. you should get notes more often. :P. And it was really just the first part that threw me off
awww... noo, it's fine (: I'm just unconvinceable. :P 
Thank you though (:
awww please don't.. You're amazing! :D~. (cameo goatee aka genie beard) :P
Whoaaaaaaa :D that's so crazy. And I feel lucky, because I was going to miss you (:
that's exactly what to miss
You're too perfect to not miss (:
maybe to you. I don't think I can ever believe it though.
I think you're so so so so so perfect Peter. (: You just do everything in the best way ever.
and i'm sorry :/. lol :P crazy in love?. with you?
It's all a matter of opinion, though, right? (: I think everyone would agree on your cool-ness though :D! . It was so cool seeing you at school today. (:. In fact, since you've been going to school, BHS has saved millions of dollars on Air Con. bills. :P. The heating bill, however, is wayyy high. :P
y'know.. to diffuse all that coolness.
lol :p!!!. yes! exactly. you're like.. that cool. And you're always chillin'. :P
you don't have to be, because I didn't notice you doing anything wrong (:. And I'd forgive you even if you did
I love everything you do (: And it sounds crazy, but I've never known you to do anything wrong ever since I met you. :D. But I believe it, because it's you. (: And that makes me the luckiest person ever :D!
(: aw, don't feel bad for anything. I feel bad for anything that doesn't come true :(
Thanks. (: You're really good at that.
Cheering me up :D
aw. (: Well you make me happier by just being around. :P. (: There's an insane accumulation of butterflies in my tummy area. }|{. :p
lol I'll probably live forever then, since you make people live longer with or without hugs . :P You're just magic like that...
I know :P It's probably just all the amazing things that you do making them confused though.
Aw :( . maybe you need more hugs then? :P. lol. sorry :P kidding
well maybe I wasn't kidding then. :P  whoa, ninja gifts are cool. :D
Or was I? :P
oh.. yeah. :P
:D!!! lol awww... I wish my mom would let me ninja gift people. y'know.. like you. :P. Maybe I can reverse ninja gift you.
:P whoa, like, right now?. and no opposition whatsoever :P
It's so fine :P And I don't think my mom will mind either
aww don't be too ninja :P. the only time I'd wish for you failing.. :P. byebye :D

Ahh, sorry i'm so bad at finding you :P have a really nice day though!

Aw, the ninja drawing was really really really cute (: Thank you so much for letting me borrow your necklace. I feel like the specialist person ever. (:. Ah, I always have pretty bad timing :P But I hope you're having a good thrusday not crossing the country. :D
:P It's fine
Nah, tis I
:D!!! I love silly things from you, and thank you so so so much for everything, esepcially letting me borrow your luck and for all the Winnie the Pooh egg-guys (:
(: It was the luckiest luck ever besides actually having you around. :D. lol and I made sure it didn't go unused because I really needed it :P
I'm not sure what I would've done without it. :P
No way, I would've probably forgotten everything :P
it's completely rational. :P. :D. just like.. um.. whole numbers?. :P lol sorry
:D!!! i would totally want to see you. sorry :P
Yes, really. (: I'd still feel like it's all out of the way though.
:P lol wow, thanks (:
if you'd really want :D you could pick up your jacket too, if you needed it :P. It sounds sooo out of the way though... lol :P we could always do like, physics homework together or something?. sorry :P 
aw yay :D. lol wait, like, soon as in soon soon?
aw yay (:

:D!! whoa, sooo soo cool. !!!!!
:D yay. (: okay. bye. ah, you're sso so cool (:. thank you for everything!! And I hope your leg/foot is a-okay (:. :P sorry. I hope the person wasn't mad at all, but who could get mad at you anyway? (:. ahh, soo smiley (:

:D!!!!!!. It's you (:. And you're here :D
And It's amazing! :D. (:!!!!

aw, you're something so so so amazing though (:. i feel like I'm making your jacket smell all weird though :P 
I dunno, i don't think you and i mix well in jacket form. :P. or I just don't like that the you-ness is going away. :P
:D I wish too, it's part of life though, right? :P
Aw, you're so so so so cool (:
:D!!! (:. lol Don't get my hopes up. :P
aw :D Well as some person once told me.. "Give it time.". And that could mean anyyyything.. :P
That's what I was thinking it means at first, except the other way around. :P. meant*
(: !!! I could never get tired of you either. Getting tired next to you is an entirely different story. :P
:P I never know what goes down when I'm sleepy.
:P awww.. I'm still sorry for that.
for sleeping :P
(: lol thanks, but I'm still sorry, just in case I say weird things. :P But that happens even when I'm not asleep
(: lol I wouldn't know, but it sure doesn't sound like me :P Thanks anyway though.. I love everything you say :D. I'm excited for tomorrow :D and the next day! And the day after :D And then even Monday. (:. :P
Aw (: Sounds impossible, but I'll try to make sure to do whatever I'm doing right more, then. Because I must've done something right.. :P . :D
(: I should be letting you do that too. (:. :D Your amazingness is just like, a giant lightbulb of happiness and rainbows though..
Whoa, no way :P I'm obviously missing the happiest color of all.
I think it's a mix between Peter and Shamrock.. :P Shamrock was one of my favorite crayons..
lol is he too Irish?
:D!!! lol that once upon a time for me was around 3rd grade when crayons were still in circulation in my backpack. :P  whoa, even me?. I talk about Peter Shamrock? :P. I feel like there should be another 'a' in Shamrock..
like, how you add in an a type sound when you say it.. :P Whoa, like.. just now? Or.. before this?. Tacos? :P. sorry :P
:P lol wait, who's this Peter Shamrock guy?. His first name makes him sound pretty cool :D
whoaaa.. Todayness :D!. hmm, do you have some other middle name I have yet to know? :P. sorry :P I should go too I suppose :D. g'night and everything (:
Shamrock is quite a nice shade of green.
:D hey, don't be sorry. (:
:D Well I forgive you (:. Sweet dreams to you too though (: And the nice day thing applies especially as much because it's Friday! :D!!. Byebye :D (: I can't wait

(: Thanks for the luck, because it came in handy, and don't worry about delivering it (: I'll see you tomorrow for sure (: Y'know, unless it randomly floods or something... You're so so cool!! :D
lol aw, what about the glitter? :P. Glitter is forever.. :P. I could be like glitter though :D
aw, well you could come pick it up sometime :D It might have to be during the school week though. :P or I could just drop it off... lol :P maybe I don't want to be like glitter then.
(: aw. . And your voice is amazzing :D!. I don't hear it anywhere around here though.. are you sure you left it? :P
Aw, that means some random passerbyers are enjoying it :P. you're inspiring the nation though impressions and song.. and water is good for the voice anyway, right? :P
:D!! yeah, the random jokes are the best :D
aw... I hope it doesn't get water damage :(
you know what's good at fixing water damage?

aw.. maybe it is at my house... maybe next time you visit you'll be fine :D!. And your voice is ammaazing :D. But you're right, the rain is pretty crazy, it's been at it all day :P
good thing the 'labor day party' was yesterday. it's was pretty alright :D Interstate driving in the rain didn't cause any collisions.

it was that luck you wished me :P
I would've been devastated if you were devastated :P. aw.. I couldn't even imagine you in a hospital like.. long term. I would just end up living there too :P

It didn't? :(
:( aw, you being sad is one of the worst things ever. 
I can't wait to see you tomorrow (: And that rainbow was pretty amazing :D
nah, it was the one from Friday I think :D That was really cool.
really really special :D Especially with the person I was with. (was it Friday?) :D
yeah.. the days all blend and fly by when I spend them with you (:
:P What's more important is that other thingy.. (:
lol :P I feel like it's been wayyyy longer.. maybe it should be like a 4 year anniversary or something :P
I haven't even known you that long :P. but it still feels like a bunch
2 might be a teensy bit more spot-on :D 3 is a cool number too though.. lol I don't know where .5 falls in all of this :P
ohhh :D. Time is merely a state of mind.. :P. or something like that..
aw.. no gifts necessary :D especially due to the timing
aww.. I should really let you get to your "phun" physics homework though :D

You're more than amazing! I just have to show you. somehow (:

I can't forget about it though.. I wouldn't want to go either, if I could help in any way.
:/ you're never ever a waste of time..
you're amazing, and you make me so so happy :D. :/ what trivial trifle troubles you?
You're so important though..

You're my everything... (:
aw, I really wish I was better at helping :/ the most amazing guy ever being sad is just crazy... I can't wait to see you tomorrow though (:. aw. :D hi!
Nothing to be sorry for (:
:D
aw :/ I always love it when you're around though :D
:D lol hold on, let me just get my helmet and jacket on..

If I didn't have a parent around and if I couldn't get you in trouble I feel like I would :P
I wish tomorrow would come faster then. And wallet photos of me are hard to come by :P. I have one of me as a little kid..
:P I don't think that quite fits the bill though.
:D!!!. :P It'd be awesome.. Aw :/ I still wish I was better at finding out what I did wrong..
was it all the anniversary talk? :/ i think I said something off.
aw :/ I'm sorry then... I'm just so used to messing up..
Thanks.. but Hannah Montana's right.. only you're perfect (:. Aw :D!!. really?. my very own key?. :P
because you'd always be around to open it for me? :D. ooh, I'd just say.... "voo ja ja'?
:D yay. lol I'm not sure if I trust myself enough though
And I more than trust you (: . aw.. thanks (:. just as long as no one steps on it :P
Please don't be.. I'm the sorry one..
It wasn't silly, I think about it way more than I'd say. It's silly of me to not count on things going amazingly.. 
:P I wouldn't say so..
like, I wouldn't say if I did.. :P
I'm sorry if I do too. You're amazing Peter (:
:( Toy doesn't describe you at all.. You're the most amazing guy ever who I'm so so so so unbelievable lucky to have, and who I'll never ever stop having feelings for.
because you're nicer than nice (:
and cooler than a cooler of ice. (: It's okay, I think I believe you..
aw :( It doesn't sound lame at all.. And I do believe you, I trust you more than anything. I just wouldn't want you to be stuck.
(: you can call me "the girl who'll never leave your side". I'll love you even if you spell 'no' like 'know' :D
aw, I was saying it as a kidding thing :P typos get everyone. even the perfect (:
The same thing happens to me.. I just see you and it's like everything else just fades away and right there and then, it's only you and like a million rays of amazingness sweeping me into Narnia. (sorry, too cliche? :P). I really should let you get to things too though, it's so late now :P
aww... like I said, feel free to call at obscene hours, though my voice might sound all tiny then. :P . :P I thought you were always just lucky like that.. Maybe I can't find any, because I used all my luck when it turned out that you liked me. (: . And trust me Peter, you're never ever a waste of time. Thank you so much for staying to talk a little more.. You truly are amazing (: Goodnight to you too and (:!!!
(: i think you"re perfect 
(: I love you so so so so much!!!!. (: You just made my day (:. bye and G'night Peter (:
and it's gonna be the best day ever now (:. You're sooo amazing (:. ttfn. (: 
And watch out for those rhino-mouse races :P
You deserve whatever you want :D I just gotta keep trying so that I can say that I deserve you. (: Don't be sorry.  Bye Peter :D!
you deserve me sideways 8 percent :P
ooh :D! I asked if I could help today, and I just have to finish my homework
yeah :D! I hope it doesn't take too long though :(. it's one of those rhetorical analysis's. analyses*? :P
aw, I'll try to be fast, the exam time would be 40 minutes, but I can't promise that :P. you're so so so cool :D!. ah, I better get on it
And you're always a bunch of help (:
You're amazing. Bye for now (: Don't wait if I'm not finished by 5:30 though :P I don't want it to get dark or anything. I'll be back (:. Bye. sorry :P double bye there
if I did another, I would've been a backstreet boy.. :P. or um.. (Nsync?)
you too :D~!
bye!. lol :P one of them had a crazy squirrel looking guy on the album cover :P
Yeah, I always wondered that too. :P okay (: I'll do my very best :D Bye!. for now.. (:
Can i meet you there anyway? :P. I still have a ways to go, but I can help for an hour or so :D. I'll assume you're at the duck pond and go over there :P I mean, I could call, but where's the fun in that?. See you soon hopefully!
Ah, i'm really sorry i missed your calls :( - my phone was being all silent. Have an amazing night though and some really cool dreams (:
:D I like you calling (: I hope you have a great rest of the day too (: And it's fine, I think my mom is going somewhat easy on me after getting some brownies points. Like, literally.. I made brownies... :P Actually, just kidding, but that'd be cool.
you're right :D!!! everyone loves brownies :D. And no way :D You're so awesome
aw :( you shouldn't feel bad at all, I'm not in as much trouble as I thought really. I shouldn't have worried you.
:P You already have all my brownie points. I could give you cupcake points though :D. you have a bunch of those too :P
lol it's fine :P I don't think any amount of desserts could appease her. She's allowing me to go to that football game thingy today at least :D
thanks :D Are you heading out there too?
aw :(. I'm sorry. I could give you a ride there if you wanted, but I'm getting a ride home from a friend, so you might be a little stuck in a football stadium :P
you definitely wouldn't be :D. And I bet your buds are there :P (not earbuds though..). :P
aw, don't worry about me with stuff like that. :( And I could always give you a ride if you had a ride home :D
ooh, what kind of message? :D And thanks :P I'll miss stalking you there though..
aw :( I want to give you a message :D
Hi :D!
There :P. aw (: yay
I was looking forward to it too. You're so cool (:. Nothing at all? There's always jenga.... :D
I have one over here :D. I could mail it over? :P
ah, I guess you're right..
:/ I can always give you that ride... :D. the the fun can commence :D. or something of that sort
then*
You haven't done anyyything though :D! I'd say it's nothing :D
or not anything bad at least :D And I really really really liked that comic you made.. What about it isn't nothing? . If you don't mind me asking..
aw :( Well I can assure you that you haven't been awful to me at all, so no worries there.
It was, but it was pretty sunny today at least, and that's good, right? :D
But where?
aw :( solitary raincloud?
What's wrong though? I'm really sorry if it's anything I've said or done.. :(. Spiders are scary.
I don't understand how though.. You really haven't done anything wrong :D
As my crazy psychology professor said.. "operationalize that." :P
yeah, I had to head up to that art meeting though, so we didn't talk long.. that's not why you feel awful, is it?
I wish I knew what was up :/ You do everything perfectly.
Ah, it's merely a temporary thing, All those don't mean anything. :D If anything they're just worries I sent your way. I didn't mean for you to feel bad though, I guess I was just sharing :/ I'll try not to for negative stuff like that though. I'd just rather you not take comments like that too personally or harshly. . Really, letting me bother you like that doesn't add up to anything. :D. or nothing good at least :(
That's what it sounds like, because none of those were even remotely your fault. :D
And you're more than good enough--In fact, you're so good that you don't even need to listen to me saying things like that. :/ 
I'm sorry, Peter..
Making you sad. :( It's silly, but that's the worst thing ever to me. And I don't know if that's exactly what you're saying, but I'll really try not to get you down like that anymore.
You're perfect, Peter :D It's just me messing everything up like usual. Trust me.
:/ Ah, I'm sorry then. I don't want to make you feel guilty either. Just trust me, none of this is your fault.. :D
And this is probably awfully transparent of me, and terrible considering, but I can't tell what's wrong. :/ Like, I'm really bad at being intuitive sometimes. So if it's something I'm doing, you might just need to point it out to me--even if there's no fun in that. :P
Or if it's not something I'm doing, then I could still try to make you feel better or something of the such :D. Just don't feel bad over nothing though, that's the very worst :(
If your life is happy, then you should be happy :D And if there's nothing wrong, then that's because there's not meant to be.. I'm yours, and getting in trouble really doesn't bother me. (:
Nah, I could've called, or gone inside and checked in. Really, you're not responsible--even if you'd rather be. :P  And I'm probably not even in that deep trouble if I'm allowed to go to the game
Well you don't have to worry about that :D because pinky promises are so legit. (no sarcasm). and nice song (:. And I'm sorry it's happened before, but it won't as long as you want me around :D
oh no :( well if I start seeing gibberish, I'll know to come over
but like I said, being sad about nothing is the worst, I wish I could be better and prevent you from getting like this the first place, but all I can do is just try to reassure you :/. what's club card? :D
If you can, just trust me, because I'm letting you know for sure that I'm not going anywhere
And you don't need a hug to know that I love you (:. :/ but I'm sorry.
ooh, what kinds of benefits? :P They all sound like not so good things.
:/ I'm sorry..
Ah, if the feeling really is bad, I can keep reassuring you :D. And I'm sorry :/
:/
you're right, I'm not very good at seeing the signs either :/. either that, or I cause them. ah, I'm just sorry Peter ://. I feel so so so guilty for everything :/ and I don't want to make you feel bad
When you stay stuff like this, I can't tell what you want me to do :/ I don't think I'm right for anything. 
:/ We all know how good I am at that :P. And it sounds pretty important :D
:/ but then it's still there behind everything?
I'm very cheered up thanks to you (:. I think that's what I should be saying to you.
no, it's fine :D no trouble, and I was fine. ah, sorry for the double-usage of fine
yay :D triple. (:
yay :D. Saturdays
just don't forget about airsoft :D. !! 2 o clock sharp
aw :(
lol it's cool, I've never played before to know what you mean, but It seems pretty justified.  I'm not sure that being the target when a bunch of guns are around is a good thing :D. I'd take your place though, just to get to play airsoft :D!!. as long as you were there too :P
as a non-hostage. yay :D!
lol there should be a bunch of girls that play
ooh, I wanna play airsoft with you :D. or paintball. it sounds so fun :D
isn't that what airsoft is? :P like, getting shot at by everyone and trying to hide?  And wearing really thick sweaters? :D Sorry, I'm not one to know anything about airsoft or your position though. I'd rather be running back :D
That's why you gotta hide :D. right?. maybe?
maybe not? :P sorry I trust your reasoning
it means they try to hit you?
oh, well just tell them you want to go on break :D or that you're fighting for civil rights. ooh, you should go on strike :D!!. I feel like they'd understand if you just say you're tired of it--I mean, I guess you've tried all that already though :/
Airsoft=fun :D!. to me
but maybe that's because I've never played?
lol bb guns are much better, right? :P. ooh, nerf guns!!!
I love those :D!!. the ones with the darts
ohhhhh, whoops.
Tell him I like his tie :D And happy early birthday to him.
ooh cool :D! I'll do it. oh hey, he could always give you a ride home if I gave you a ride there, right? :P. sorry, I guess I shouldn't obligate him to that :P
any reason why your dad is specifically against airsoft? o.o is it the 9/11 thing?
oh aw. Well it's not like you asked him to come back for you :P
bad experience?
hmm.. if it's not 9/11... and it's not someone's birthday... then it must be... the 9/10/11 correlation, right? :D. special day tomorrow?
sorry :P I was guessing.. Oh no.. I know what you're saying.. :(. I'm sorry. I shouldn't've asked
:D!! ooh, I wanna do the thing your dad asked!. :P
unless it has to do with dead things :(
Do you want to miss it?. sorry :P. I should stop bothering you. I'm saying silly stuff
something that could've been nice?. :D
it's so vague, it just might make sense. ah, did I get you in trouble too? :(
not that I'm in trouble :P
ah, okay :D. :P any other hints?. if you'd even care to tell me
:/
Bye Peter, Have any amazing night :D And make sure that the rainbows don't explode in your microwave.. ooh, Peep wars :D. !! we have to try that sometime :D
Bye (: Ah, I'm really worried though..
I haven't been wanting to say anything in case it makes it worse. :/ I'm sorry. but if it is any of the things you said, then just know that it's never your fault and that I'll always be yours, even if I do a terrible job as even just your friend :/. You're amazing though :D. And I still want you to have an amazing night! In fact, I'll send a message to all my Peeps, and maybe they can help you out even though they're just marshamallows, and its not easter... :P . (:. You're so awesome Peter.. Good luck with tomorrow. I don't know quite what is it, but I hope it goes alright.. I don't even know if I'm entitled to find out, but I hope I get to talk to you later either way. 
Ttfn :D. You're really good at drawing
i guess I meant more like.. what was supposed to happen, or what went differently than you would've wanted. Aw, i can't find you. :(. May I call you? :/ I know you said you'd rather I follow you, but everything makes it seem like I should let you be alone or something. :(  I really hope you're okay.. Is that a yes?. :/ I'm sorry.. I don't want to bother anyone this late, but talking to you sounds cool :D. I'm sorry I missed you at the game, I heard your parents saying you had just left and I felt pretty bad that I hadn't been like, just a few minutes earlier. . You're really cool though, and I hope you have an awesome Saturday! :D I'll stay on all night, so don't worry about messaging me late.
which one? :D
as long as it's not the shadowlurker :P. :D okay
is it on the porch?
okay :D I'll go look
I love you.. No matter what. and I'm so so so so sorry.
It's fine. Can I call you now then? :D
I think you already have :D
:/ I wouldn't mind if you didn't say anything at all. I just have to tell you some stuff
This song has been stuck in my head all day.. Thank you so much and G'night (:
You're so so so so soooo amazing :D!!!. And I hope your day is going well too (: Aw, I was hoping we could watch Doctor Who, but my mom says I can't invite you until tomorrow (if you'd want to :D)
:D. Have a really awesome day (: You're so cool! I'm excited for Doctor Who if you'd be up for it/ allowed :D
Awesome :D and the cast makes it sound especially good, right? :D
:P Michael Jordan would be cool.. :D
aw, it's kind of late, but I was wondering if I could drop off a thingy.... :D
I definitely want to do something later :D. or right now :P
Whoa, cool :D!!!. Aw, I was thinking doctor who, but my mom kind of set up a temporary home office in the living room while she catches up on taxes and some paperwork and stuff :P. but yeah, I want to give you a thingy.. I'm not sure if you have it already though..
aw, can I bike over first? :D!
yay :D And nah, it's cool (: 
:D!!! Would any time in particular be nice?
yay :D!. I will show up very soon then :D. if that's alright.. I'd say 2:10 :D!. I'll be very ninja.
:P I can try
I'll be sooo ninja, that I'll just zip right by without you noticing :P. and then you'll suddenly realize that you have something in your hands.... :P
I'll come back though :P. I'd just want to prove my ninjaness, or lack of :P. Anywho, see you soon? :P
cool (: ttyl. Thank you so so so so much (: I had an awesome time, and I hope you did too (:. I'm sorry we didn't get to finish Up :D
but there will be time (:
awwwww!!! oh no, you have homework?. I'm so so sorry, I should've asked.
but I know just what to write :D
is it for like, college?
:D! you can write about how... you did something, and it showed your perseverance and dedication and helped you grow as a person. :P I know it's cliche.. but it's something.
I won't know either when it's my time :(
aw, but It's nothing to write about really. I'd have to exaggerate or something, and I feel like honesty is the best for those things.. Aw. :D. (:. "I have band-aids". well you're like the nicest guy ever :D And you volunteer too (:
:D!!! crazy. I wonder how they worked that in
ah, I'm sorry, I almost started a fire in my kitchen :P. it was just the toaster though
lol :P Whoa, I guess there's all kinds of ideas for college essays. yeah, I'm fine, it just meant I had to finish cooking everything :P I'm sorry, I should've said 'brb' at least. maybe I can say it now for earlier... "brb for earlier.". but I'm back for the time being. I liked you being around while volunteering (: You're really cool. ahh, and today was so so awesome :D!!
Whoa, sheet of paper lyring around?
lol :P that's funny. I just wish I knew what she's looking for--I can never seem to get a good mark on those things :P And I'll get around to it (:
:P lol nah, that's totally cheating. I think... Would it be bad if you told me what she took points off for? (if any? :P). or if you have to write a lot? :P sorry.. I'll just do my best I suppose :D
okay cool :D 
I'm thinking you write the reasons for both?. and it's fine :D. (: You're so so so so cool. And I should let you get to having fun (: I wish I could've helped you clean up more!

I do :D!. I think :P
:P I'd need a guy named Peter Mattox with me before I watch it though. Any news on halloween festivities?

I just need 2 yards of the thin black 'costume satin' guy and 2.5 yards of the thin blue satin one. It's the one that's at the front of the store for 50% off :P. and the shade of blue can be whichever one you think would work the best with the black :D
I think so :P or at least for the back of the cape.. 
would that look okay? :P
I could always just skip it and do all black :D I wasn't sure yet..
:P I don't think I'm doing a specific one. It can be like.. a hybrid. hmm
it does :P
:D okay. I like your ideas though
oh wait, just kidding about the blue :P I like your sketch better :D. so just the 2 yards of black. sorry
and with that, I'll let you head out :D. (:

somone's mom is 80 years old. :P. but not really. because there aren't many pregnant 60 year olds around..

you're cool :D!
nice :D! . and you definitely are (:. hmm, do you have anyone who could come speak for our Thanksgiving assembly?. do you know of anyone*
I guess like.. someone who'd be available to come (I was hoping Taylor Swift, but she's hard to contact :P) who would be a good speaker
It's cool :P
I was going to try to ask Elliot Yamin.. :P
ooh :D! people who can talk?. and nah, the less official, the better. because that means they could probably come :P
lol that was just an idea, but no.. I mean just someone. they don't even have to be well known. I was just thinking wishfully :P. Just someone who people would listen to and like :D
lol :P we get the football players every year. some people were just suggesting that they weren't the best speakers.. Last year Garland Smith's mom came to talk. along with the football players.. I just can't think of any local famous-y people :P. hmm
:D!!

I'm wondering if the marshmallow roasting is going to be happening directly on the hay ride though :P . Hay is pretty flammable, so I've heard :P. You're so so so cool!. sorry :P but you are!
aw, I just noticed I missed your call, and I'm sorry for that!  I was actually really wanting to call you around 5:40, but I thought you might've left for Robotics already. I hope it went awesomely :D I'm all caught up in this History "project," but I'd like to say "Hi" to you (:
:D!!! . !!!!!!!!!!!! (:!!!!!!. I love you too!!! (:. Sooo soo mush. much* :P. (:!! I want to say hi (:. Even if it's short
but... you're more important :D. and I have time. the political cartoon shouldn't take too long I hope. And the poster/lifesize cutout won't either :D. And the art stuff isn't bad :D. I knocked out all the reading already! :D
:D!! yay. :D!!!. (:
I am (:. are you near the phone :D. ?*
yay (:!! Okay, I found it :D! (: expect a call

it's okay :P I'm totally keeping that different cup :P
:D!! I'll treat it as if it's my own.. or not, because I put that one in the recycling already :P
lol but it was a cup like no other... It was frantic and leaking while all other cups stood strong. It was courageous as a non-conformist! :D. just what our country needs :P. In a sense.... :D
:P the crying cup is the one who gets more attention, the strong cup just gets more water in it.
but oh nos, what do you need to do?
:P that's ironic. is it that chapter 2-4 review thingy?
aww!! I'm really really sorry for taking up your time today when you could've been doing that. I should've asked you first :P
but I"ll let you get to it now :D! and good luck. And sweet dreams for later. And if I can help in any way, let me know :D
ohh, okay :D That sounds a teesy bit better, but I'll still let you get going (:

It sounds fun though :D! and I can't next weekend.. . Would you be free today though?
What's halloween without some pumpkin carving though? :D 
:D i was hoping to have you there too, otherwise the pumpkin's face will end up looking like... well.. a bunch of random shapes :P
It'd be way more fun than anything I could do alone :D
aw :( 
that's why being with you would be awesomer than aloneness :D!. So would you want to? :D
To have fun :D
ah, just kidding, my mom wouldn't be able to take us anyway
are they pick-up-able?. :P. :D
ah, okay :P. sorry for beeing a letdown of sorts. pumpkin patching is pretty cool though :D
Well next year I can drive :D so no worries on a ride

G'night and sweet dreams :D ooh, and see you tomorrow! Even if I'm a walking zombie :P. oh wait, most zombies do walk, so maybe that last bit was a bit redundant :P. sorry. :P bye for now!

And it's okay, I think I'll just have some cereal instead :D!
:P lol ooh, waffles :D!. I have a question.....

tu no tienes razon :D
I think you're quite the winner :D
I don't know.. you're pretty good at beating me in those fighting games :P
I'm pretty sure fighting games are what determine loser or winner status :P. And I didn't notice :P
I would most definitely :D!! (:
that's sounds good :D especially if we had a magic talking dog...
they seem pretty skilled at having adventures :P
yay :D. lol does that make me Finn?
:P lol maybe I can be Lord Monochromicorn :D!. sorry for the slowness
:3. hmm, plaid or stripes?

yup :D
could I go ask my mom and get back to you first though? :D
okay, I can :D
lol :P did you think she'd say no?
ooh, and she said you could actually come over too :P
:D I kind of did like your park idea :D

I love you, Peter. (: thank you for lending me your hoodie. I hope your family gets home soon. Sorry i had to leave in a rush, my mom was just a little upset.. i'm fine though, I got home in time :D. I had so much fun today too :D but don't be sorry! (:. (: g'night . I love you so much (:
I had the best time today! :3
I love you too :D!
Don't be sorry for anything. (: And you're definitely not a faliure.. I've never ever thought that.
Well I don't think you are. Actually, I'm sure that you're not. :D. you've never ever 'failed' me
I don't know when then... I was actually wondering if I could call you back :D I don't want to disturb anyone though... especially not you.
:/ You're never that either!. :D
but.. how can you be a waste of my time if I don't think you are? :D
I love talking to you and being with you and doing stuffs with you :D. you're a fun guy :D. but not like mushrooms. you're the bestest best friend :D
okay? :D
It's okay, I did laundry :P
or maybe you had it spot on :P. because you're not a disappointment :D
so, was that a no to the call back?
but you're not a waste of time :D!
you're amazing :D
You are :D. (:
It's all over town.. Billboards... Newspapers... They all say one thing
:P. I don't feel like that at all. What do you think you did wrong in particular?. like.. school stuffs?. maybe I could help?
That doesn't sounds like anything that everyone doesn't mess up on everyday. and you can take all those ones having to do with me out--because I don't think any of them are stuff you did wrong.. Those don't sound*. :3 you're awesome
And I love you..
of course I want someone like you
and I'm sorry about the hot honey, may I ask where someone finds hot honey? :D
ohh, whoa. . Well it's okay, it sounds like something I would do :P. maybe if you'd had company it'd've been more fun :P
And if that's all you feel like you mess up on, then you can stop worrying :D 
I don't think that means you're silly.. I'm pretty not careful when it comes to household activities :P
Sorry if this sounds bad or mean or something.. but from my point of view, all the stuff you're listing doesn't sound like anything to be sad about.. :/. And you didn't do anything wrong last night..
:P lol I just meant I was curious what it looks when worn. And I know those things aren't very comfortable, so I wouldn't've made you wear it :P. looks like*. why worry about the small stuff? (:
or the big stuff either
oh nos, did you wear one of those baklavas? :P
you can do as much bad stuff as you want, if you consider those things bad. Just maybe not the burning. I don't want you to get hurt... :/ . Peter... You don't have to be sad over all these things... they don't seem so bad.. :/ or maybe just from my perspective. I can understand the honey burn--but origami is tough stuff ::P
I do care. :/ about both
Could I please call you?
And I do.
:/ . but why?. I know you just explained it all... but I do care..
And burns heal... And butterflies keep on flying all the way to Mexico :D
http://www.amazon.com/Gotta-Go-Sam-Swope/dp/0374327572 :P. and I can stay up all night if you need. I just don't want you to worry or be sad anymore :/
if you want*. better? :P (:
hold on though.. I gotta go get a certain hoodie from downstairs :P
and I like talking to you :d. :D*
even when you're sad. And even if I don't quite understand the sadness you feel :/. I want to make it better..
:/ It matters if it's enough to bother you.
I say it is... and make what special?
the first thing I say matters?. It's always mattered before too. and my 3rd grade booklet totally told me that "Matter matters" too :P. as surprised I am that I remember that..
why didn't it?
(teehee :P I knew you'd agree that Matter matters). when? I don't remember at all :/. maybe I was possessed by that little girl :P
and if it was on the phone..
well you know what happens with that :P. I'm still pretty convinced it skips all the important stuff
do you feel better? :D!. can I tell you on the phone..?
you know... :3
I hope you do :D!. and if you don't, I'll gladly tell you (:
if I can find my phone :P. hold on..
:(. I don't know where it went..
I'l find it though
whoa... it was like.. right next to me the whole time :P
I know :P. lol how does that happen?
Now I'll never wonder what Man vs. Food is..
because I watched it in class, and it's pretty scary :P
hey, don't be sorry Peter. :D nothing to apologize for. G'night :D. could I call you? y'know.. now that I've found my phone and everything?
I'd want to.. but if it's not possible then I can always see you tomorrow :D
And no, it's not :/ did you have something planned for then? :P. or a curfew? O.o
or a pizza party? <:D!. oh no. I'll let you go :D. sorry about that. :D!. bye (:. I love you!
Have some really awesome dreams :D
?

I don't think he's on my "VIP" list. :P. just kidding, it's not very exclusive. and I've already said it. :D
I love you. (:. And nah. Really not that many. . right now they're only 3 people online :P
but I'll let you get to sleep :P
lol I was going for that early thingy too. sometimes it's good too :D. to*. whoa :P that sounds pretty exclusive. :D bye Peter. :D
:P lol.. silly, I don't ever use facebook chat.. Even though it's probably good to talk to people on the site everyone seems to be on... Bye Peter :D
See you tomorrow, I hope! :D
I just said that I love you (:
bye :D. G'night and everything! :D. Aw :/ my mom said never on weekdays. I could still help you out though if you'd like. :D which calculus chapter is it?

Hey, don't go to kroger! It's all desserted. And not the good kind :P

:P . aw.. (:. yay. :D!!. hmm... so what is your favorite kind of soup?
:P !!!. de ja vu. :D. cool
:P
lol is it coming back to you?
I think I totally had a 'soup conversation' with you :P. last year. or before..
I just relate you and chowder now... :P
:D
(:. !!! yay. :P. maybe it started with me being all like.. "if you could only have one type of food for the rest of your life...". And I would've said either soup or sandwiches :P. and you would've said Italian at first? :P. I can't remember exactly.
:D!!! food :D
aww. I do deliveries :P
"Hey Mom, can I go bring Peter some soup?"
Her: "What kind?". Me: "Chowder". Her: "No.". :P
my guess :P I'll do it though :D! . :P I wonder how close I am
I feel like she'll be all: "Doesn't he have his own soup." first instead
That's pretty crazy o.o
During the winter, I think we live on Campbells. :P
lol yeah :P
okay, real conversation:. "Hey Mom, can I go bring Peter some of this soup."  
"Where is Peter that he needs soup?" . "Antarctica.". "No, Peter can find his own food." . :P. aw :(. poor Peter :P
lol :P. I omitted the "I don't want you running around places.". if you were really in Antarctica, I would learn how to fly a chopper, and bring you some soup :P. And take you with me if you wanted. Hey, I gotta finish some homework :(
!!! :P lol yeah!. the penguins could've knocked you out and taken you :P. I hope you get that sunset/rise picture
5:10pm Thursday (EST) - Sunset in Blacksburg, VA 19 minutes from now . :D!!! lol yesss! :P

Actually, I don't know if any guy would want to be called Theodore.

lol what? :P
a little raccoon? :P
I don't know if I'd go for the bushy tail look... :P maybe as a pet.. if he didn't tear my face off. And I could name him Timothy!. sorry :P. I'll let you go :D. instead of talking about pet Raccoons :P
aw :( I like Peter :D. James is a nice name too :D As long as it's not in a Twilight book :P. you have fun too :D! 
And it's silly, I was just thinking more of pet name's or um kid names or something. sorry. lol he's the evil one. I think

You have an amazing day too!! :D!!. I just noticed I all missed your call though!. :(. I need to get good at carrying around my cellphone :P
:D!! I hope yours was too. :D!. Didja head to practice this morning?
awww, :P lol sorry. Must've been all those late night activities, right? :P
oh nos :P Alarm clocks are super helpful. I should've been yours.. I should've called you up and said.......... "Hey. Don't oversleep." :P
It's cool :P I've been working hard on biology studying and whatnot
aw.. :P but there's only so much mitosis one can take in. it makes my toesies fall asleep :P
*ba dum..chh*. no way, the fun never ends :P
Well you may not say so, but I think you are :D!
And you should believe it :P. I wish I could be more persuasive
You're smart, but you never seem to understand how amazing you are :D. whoa, home alone again?
reminds me of those movies :P
what are you hoping to wish for tonight? :D And that'd be really cool :D!! I need to decide which home alone movie is  my favorite :P
They do seem to be pretty Christmas themed. And I can't exactly remember them by numbers :P. just by plot. :P
mini summaries?
lol :P
These are very specific.. hmm.. I like the one with um.. the stairs and the paint..
:P specific too?. lol whoops, I thought they all might've had it. ooh, and you can't forget the dumwaiter :D!
lol :P. whoa. I think I missed out on the creepy old man. I've seen the 3rd one the most I think :P
:D!!. once is all it takes. But I have a terrible memory.. I always like rewatching movies :P
Whoaa, really?
Well it sounds like a nice tradition. (: The only tradition I have is a Christmas tree :P the rest is whatever comes to mind
:D! I would love to watch Home Alone with you. Especially since I don't remember much of it. :P. just people sneaking around houses. Being criminal-like. :P 
:D Nah, that part where you asked me was the crazy part. (: Crazy, but welcome. And nope, I was just looking this up: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream_Team . Whoa, watch out.. you know what happens when kids get left 'home alone' :P
:D!! I bet the Home Alone kids are awesome at making Rube Goldberm machines. What's the thing that can't come true?. (oh, and I think that's the movie with the pumpkins and ghosts)
:D!!. whoa.
We totally could, even if it's not halloween
Even a disney channel movie could scare me :P. :D!! We totally could.. And aw :( I don't wish you didn't. It's okay and I don't want you to feel bad about it 
:D!! we could totally. Wishing that things didn't happen could change everyything. So I try not to
you make things better :D. And I love everything you do (:. Except for you not accepting your amazingness ;P. :P*. :D!! We should do it :D. I don't know when, but we can (:
:P !! lol right now sounds perfect :P. (: if only. And trust me, you're anything but lame :D
Need I remind you who makes super duper awesome art and books and hot chocolate?
Yes, with secret vanilla in there :P. And I say you're special :D
You're special full time. (: I hope I do make you feel special though :d. :D*
aw (: Maybe I'm just special around you because you make me feel that way :D. :P
or totally legit :P
the supreme court would even agree :P . or at least um.. hmm.. judge judy?. just to y'know.. qualify it's legitness
I'll agree with that :P Judge Judy never makes much sense. I actually don' think I've ever seen it before :P maybe once or twice
I love you too (:. And don't be sorry at all. I messed up too
but I don't think you did
you're perfect too!!!!!!. <("). (:
Perfect Peter
uh huh :P. lol. I happen to think you're super amazing (:
there never was a bill. but if there was, I'd prefer you over him :P
psh, what stuffs? :P
just physics, and neverending studying. too much too learn :P. !! I don't how how you messed up either, Peter. (rhymey? :D)
not to me :D. I don't think you messed up at all. And neverending studying never ends :P so why do it all at once?. I used to really like the 'neverending' story :D I think I still do. I can't remember all that much though
it was a good story I think! :D
you didn't mess up at all. I would call you if I didn't have hiccups :P
:P !. lol I've never tried that before
:D! it works :D. I'm cured :P. I never have hiccups for too long.. What's the longest you have? :P
That is pretty long :P maybe just because you were water-less
I think I might head to bed soon :P I'm so sleepy for some reason. I didn't even watch City of Ember today :P. just kidding, I bet it was a really good movie. And i'm still really really sorry I fell asleep
yeah :D!. lol :P
take #2. :3 you're perfect (:. And warm. (:
I wonder what you'd be like asleep. :P I like what you say too much though. . lol those socks did seem pretty warm!
awww :D!. I don't think I'd get bored if you were there. :D it'd be all warm. And cute. (:. can I maybe call you?. since those hiccups are gone and all...
I love you too (:. And yay :D! but aw, because it must be lonely :(
you don't mess up, Peter :D. Or at least, I've never seen you mess up
I'd never consider that messing up :d. :D*
That's me :d. :D*. brb really fast, I gotta brush my teeth :P
:D!. back :D. in a not so fast manner :P
yay :D!!!!!!!!! *jumping up and down?*. :D!. !!!!. (:. I love you so so so so much, Peter :D!!
(:
aw (:. :D! I think you're cute (:. G'night Peter :D. I laheartve you :D. (: 
I hope you're having a really awesome day. (: and if your Sunday needs more sun, i hope you find some. (:
:D sweet dreams and see you tomorrow :p
!!! :D. Hey. How was that class that involves robots and tics?. :P. or some robot tics?. tic tacs?. tic tac toes?
nah :D important stuff is you. or um.. you're important :D
not to be confused with imported :P
You don't have to be, though I'd forgive you for anything. (besides kicking puppies) :P. But seriously.. not the puppies.. :P. You being sorry confuses me a lot.
aw, what happened?. :/ Are you alright?
after practice? did you get to robotics on time and everything?
well that's good :d
:D*. You do matter. What's wrong?
It definitely does if it's bothering you.. For sure.
Would the phone be just as bad?
And I know why I'd care.
oh no :/ Is tomorrow not quick enough?
:/. Skype maybe? . Peter, what's wrong?
nothing?
Are you sure? 
I trust you.. but you don't normally say what's wrong :/. so I can never tell
Okay, but let me know when you have the chance.  Bothers aren't to good to be bothered by.
okay <(")
You're welcome to be sad here! :D. not because I like you being sad, but because I could try to help.
and I'd do anything just to see you smile.. (is that a song?)
I can imagine it. (:
but I can't imagine you smiling right about now... normally when you're happy you smile :D. so I'd have to make you happy first, right? :D
Well it's hard without being able to use the tools of the trade... squirting flowers and cream pies don't work quite as effectively through the internet.. :P
ah, my jokes never sound like jokes.
:/ I don't know quite how to show you..
if actions speak louder, what can I do?
write you a song, i'd make a few, silly rhymes could be my thing if they'd please you
:/. Dude, I like you.
you don't mess up and Friday night was just another best day ever :D
Happy things can't hurt.. except for really sharp candy canes..
oh nos! go do it now!! :P
if you're willing to stay up till the ripe hour of um.. 11 :P. can hours be ripe?. or just fruit?. these are important questions. And didja get lots of homework tonight?
you asked if?
studying is good :D you'd do fine on the physics one. ohhh on laundry? :D. Laundry is kind of fun.. I never sort colors like my mom though..
Everything in one load does the trick :P
except for sports stuff that doesn't like fabric softener. and whites that turn all lackluster when they mingle with the darks. 
Not cool laundry. That was back before the 21st century.
okay :D laundry is always fun to watch, but it's mostly just a bunch of lint collecting and pouring and waiting.. And good smells :D
well what's making you sad? :D
:/
I do care :/. I don't know how to show it though... I feel like I've been saying everything short of freaking out.
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O>O!@$!!!!!!$#@%%%%%%%%%^$#$@^%$&^#%WUYCGEJxzOOOOOOIAZXHv D@## Whatsssssssssssss wrong!#$#WAQQ# . :P which is ironically what I feel like... even that part where I was all.. WUYCGEJxzOJOEFJOEIHFWOIEHFR!. and the symbols too. mmmhm.
wrong!? :P. whoops.*. in the excitement, I seem to have dropped my exclamation mark.
question*
plenty of exclaimation in there . exlamation*
exclamation* < this word is so difficult for me :(
Peter, is this one of those hypothetical thingy that people say about themselves? :D!
What did he say? :/ what if he just kind of eluded my fingers? 
yesterday?
let him know what?. oh nos :/ did I forget something important again?. what is it?
!! ooh can I watch it with you? :D. I'm sorry :/ I never got those yesterday.
I didn't think you replied. And it seems pretty important if it's bothering you :/
want to know what? :/
I'm sorry I missed those yesterday... I thought if you'd sent anything it'd go to my phone :/. but I'm not blaming technology persay. (persay is a word? :P persay Jackson and the Lightning thieves?) (random Capitals?). but 'YES!" :P I 'd love to watch the movie with you. I was excited about the title when you told be this morning
well? :D!!! supspense
:/ . That sounds terrrible. with threee' r's somehow. And three 'e's too. triple vision. I don't feel reluctant at all :/. And If you really needed one I feel like I would. but what can a hug do that words cannot?
but hugs are just physical?
I don't know, i meant like.. as kisses go... but I would if you needed one
okay :/
:/ You're all I want. ever. And I don't want you to feel bad. and you didn't mess up at alll
And the thing I'd never agree with you on is all the negative things you say about yourself :/. who says you're awful or the worst? I definitely don't want to be making you feel that way :/. you didn't mess up anything in my mind. It seemed like just another awesome day to me.
What happened? Was I too sleepy to notice what went wrong?. :/. maybe I should start drinking more coffee.... :P
I was there for that :P I couldn't forget
hey, it's okay
Don't worry about it :d. :D*
why? what'd you do?. :./
?
that doesn't sound so bad
you're cute :D. lol sillyhead :P. sorry. like I said, don't worry about it
I wish I knew what would :/
you don't have to be, for anything
It sounds just as though in person :/. Tell what?
sorry for all the questions :/. I'm so confused
guys are confusing.. :P. lol it's okay. I think I'm naturally confused 
I don't blame you :P Life is confusing.. confuzzling.. I haven't used that word in forever :P. I wish I were more persuasive :P
maybe a lawyer is out of the question now?
:/ I'm sorry.
no :/ I just sound like a bad girlfriend. :P. Ah, girlfriendology was never a good subject of mine... I blame the teacher :P
he never showed up to class
hey, you don't have to try--you're already the best boyfriend ever :D. just remember that. which notes?
maybe they do say I'm a good girlfriend..but I don't sound like one
:/ . lol what's your skin doing being red?
yeah, I don't question the eye thing.. yet the skin... :P
:/. That sounds scary.
I'm sorry today was so busy with the baskets :/
oh yeah, laundry is important
It was :D better than those videos they would've shown in class. whoa, your drawings were really good
I think they were pertty awesome :D. umm.. pretty* :P. no Tennesse jokes there. G'night to you too :D. And sweet dreams, Peter :D!!
:P It's so easy to deny though.
and tougher to believe, even when it's from you. It is as long as I can still tell you you're cute :D
hey, I'm using perfectly good wishes on your sweet dreams :P so I hope you get some imaginary cavities from those. lol. sorry
just so you don't see me blush
:P
right, because you're the best :D
and if you told me while I was blushing, I'd forever be a tomato :P. And then you could never love me :P. lol
aw :D
Wish I could say the same about raw onions--but that has nothing to do with me liking you :P. I think.
I say it in my head all the time
to a certain onion/question mark like guy
I'd like onions if the onion was you :P I wouldn't eat it, but I'd bring it to the park to play and eat leftover lasagna wit it (:. ith*. with*. missing letter, only the middle stayed in tact :P. letters*
And it is you :D. whoa, lasagna :D!. it is!. we should make one sometime!
have fun with the laundry :D! aw, I should've let you go to start a load at least. G'night to you too again.. I'm no duct tape :/
no mighty puddy either. :D!! lol maybe that
if it involves quacking, i'm down.. !!! :P. Can I confess I never watched that?
yay :D
Don't feel quite as bad for not being up to date with the oldies
hey, you're already the best. :P. And exactly.
:P
but that's even better than germ-x
And no one beats germ-x! :P. besides .001% of germs
And okay. :D Don't be sorry though, when I feel like I'm the master jewel thief here.  :P And not the good/cool kind. . :P lol I'm notttt  a germaphobeic. !! :O. :P*. I'm a perfectly normal sickness-avoiding person :P
C'mon, who really likes getting sick?
lol :P is she a germaphobe too or something? :P or the word 'measures'?. Tangled is good :D!!. I've only seen it like.. once, y'know.... :D
don't be so silly :P
ooh, :D!! you're right
:D (:. And I'd be Bruno Mars-crazy to keep it that way :P. Well, maybe not thattt crazy, but I like being yours :D
I just hope that you do too :/ I don't want you to feel bad because of things that I don't or do do 
lol :P do do... sorry :P
..... it's funny.. :P
lol
Webster never planned for such revelry of the english language.. :P
:P lol that's some quality humor. :D. aw :d. :D*. (:
As long as that want isn't some self-inflicting pain :P
Sometimes I feel like I cause you more bothers than I do happiness
:P I'll try if it means a lot to you
And I think I missed the pokes today and headed straight for chat :P
I'd love to tell you 'I love you' if it makes you smile :D. In my head, I'm always thinking you already know-maybe that's not so though?
don't forget, it's hard to change my mind :P
'the stubborn type' :P or something. what does your head say?
is he a very convincing guy?
o.o
Your head sounds like a meanie.. but he's so nice to me :D
:P. maybe you need some couples conseling with him... :P. he might learn to like you and appreciate your talents and personality :D
Don't sell yourself short, you'll lose it in the end. Never knew what that line meant before now.. :P. I thought they meant.. 'lose it' like.. lose a goal.
but maybe they mean craziness :P. 'lose it' like.. get sad... :P. sorry
aw okay
:D bye :D And sweet dreams to you too
lol :P !!!!. !!!. whoa!! :P.  At least christmas is still a bit away :D
hmm, reindeers or polar bears?. or everything in between?
:D!
they like cocacola. lol :P. thanks. can't see 'em in the snow anyway :P
night night :D
:D I love you too! :P. !!!. whoa!! I was just about to say something like that :P. like.. "shouldn't I be telling you that?" :P
N sync :d!.  :P
Then how do I never know what you're thinking when I need to? :P
:D I like your idea though :D
just on a single condition :P  Aw :D!! :P I can't belive I told you that. believe*
Whoa, is that what's up these days? :P
all those hipsters doin' fun stuff. aw :D. Well I'm glad I could make you happy :D
:P Caught that?. That if you really really really do get sad, that you don't let me unconvince you that I caused it.
That could explain why you always forgive me :P. :D g'night to you too. And sweet dreams :D
cavities do hurt though, so maybe only semi-sweet. Like  baker's chocolate chips. The bittersweetness grows on you. :P. Hey, it's okay!!!!!!!!! :P . yeah.. exclaimation points/. .*
ahh ,sorry :P . me too. okay, bye!. :D!. you're cool
see you tomorrow!
I love you so much too :D. And again, that's crazy :P sorry, sillyhead. :P. bye!
I love you Peter! (: :D
Thanks for being my track buddy even though i'm terrible at cheering you up :/
Hello friend :D!. how are you?. I'm glad you're still on, I was worried that I'd be too late with all my listening to intense debates about society between my mom and brother :P. aw, or maybe I am too late.. Green dots can be deceptive :P. oooohhhhh, and checking my messages say you already said g'night... :D!! well g'night to you too then :D I hope it's really teally really really awesome :D. And sweet dreams too :D. Don't oversleep for track practice tomorrow :P. (:. Don't forget, I love you so so so much--even if it's not written in sharpie.. G'night, and my phone's on if you get this later. :D. Good luck with everything. (:. And you're an awesome track buddy :D! And you're closer to the first thing on my mind. I was just waiting to get to a computer so I could actually talk to you. Turns out my phone isn't very good at receiving messages.. just sending them. Risk it for a call? . (not quite as snappy as biscuit :P). I'm just afraid to bother people :D. but if you get these, feel free :D. bye for now :P And sorry a bunch for sending all these, I'll try to go easier on the messages when you're not around to even respond to them :P. :D!. bye :D you're cool!
Good morning :D lol nice day to fly a kite?. Hey, it's okay, I should've stayed online longer :P I was so so sleepy though. 
:D!!. ello' there :D
So, any pre-thanksgiving festivities going on today for you? :P
Not that I know of :P maybe just going out to dinner. 
Track does too :D! I think that's happening somewhere today. And I'm glad you didn't oversleep :P
I had such a weird dream :P
Maybe so :P but it's totally possible. Oooh!!!! :D you first!
aw.. :P but I wanted to hear yours. Just don't forget it so soon :P
okay :P. hmm.. these are always hard to explain.. :P. well.. you were in one of them.. And I think I was going to see you, so I was biking over... :P And then I decided to stop for doughnuts *dun dun dun*. There was some stick up thing, and I got shot :P 
And then I was somewhere with dialysis in me, but then it got loose so I asked these people at a clinic to fix it for me. but then I went into this electronics store.. . And there was anoooother stick up :P . And I didn't really want to wait around in there with all the hostages, so I tried to leave really really carefully...
but then the guy with the gun saw me, so I had to like dodge out in a jewelry store, but i realized that guy was in cahoots with the gunman... :P So I went to some store person in the mall area, and the rest was like.. a fade out screen.. but then the next scene show the gunman looking all confused, and somehow I had left a note on this piece of brown paper....
It was some really elaborate rhyme/ smart note that talked about what i was gonna do to escape, and my cell phone was right next to it.. the note said that i was going to like, go call my neighbor or authorities or something to come pick me up on the store phone, and I guess that worked out :P but the next few scenes were like, me playing paintball in a store with all the other costumers.   And I think I like, had to rewind my dream a few times to un-do the second shooting that I got :P . but i was fine :D. :P. it was all action-y and cool! :D. sorry it's so long/confusing though
:P it sounds crazy. I remember like, questioning the story line in my sleep... because like.. how did I have time to leave some elaborate note when he was right on my tail? :P. that's just insane
I was all like.. "whoa, what's up with this weird dream?" . lol oh yeah, I can evade the bad guys any day. the shooting didn't really hurt at all though :P I didn't even bleed.. I just got some holes in me :P. lol. okay, your turn :D!
nooooooo :P!!!!!!!!!!. Remember!!! Quick! :P
!!!
:D!!!! puppy :d!!. :D*
It sounds so fun :D but 
lol :P sounds better than paint ball. aw, why am i always leaving in your dreams? :P. lol

Happy thanksgiving Peter! (: I hope everything is goingwell and that you're withfamily and being happyand thankful. :DYou're really something.(:  Gnight for now
Aw :( once again, i'm sorry i kept you so late at my house. How early was thanksgiving? Maybe you guys can do a doover.
!!! :D helloW!!!
Ah, I'm sorry I didn't respond again, it was partly because I didn't get more messages, and partly because I fell asleep and had a dream about your thanksgiving :(. I think I miss you too
 I'm alrightish, I do feel like I should be intensely studying for the SAT, but that's all :P How are you?. It's not silly. But I still hope your thanksgiving was alright :/
May I ask if your grandmother is doing alright? Did you get to visit her? 
Aw, well I hope she's improving. I'll keep sending my 11:11's her way :D 
Oh, I just meant I felt bad for not studying.. like, I should be.. but I havent' talked to you in foreverrrr. :D!. Do you feel a little better now?
like, from yesterday?. That's good :D!
It's important, and I like it :D
And you're important too :D. and I love you (:
And I feel like I wouldn't have the 'drive' to study right about now :P
I would just go eat frozen blueberries and unfrozen bananas. lol because Coach Relleford(sp) isn't here :P . just kidding... studying is just tough to start sometimes. and bananas taste good :D. (: I love you so so so much
(: You're a pretty motivating person.
:D!. (:. You're perfect
I wish your thanksgiving could've been better though :/ I feel bad about that
I don't want you to have a less than amazing thanksgiving :(. everything you do should be great :D
:(
but it's not the meaning of thanksgiving :(. And naps are good if you were tired. or feeling bad. I should've woken you up :P 
Yeah :D
that
really? :D!!. well that's good then
sorry :P I was under the impression that you slept through the whole day :P. somehow..
And your first message sounded so sad :(. oh whoa. I think I went to sleep around that time :P. actually.. I was just leaving someone's house :P. so it sounds like a reasonable time to fall asleep :D
lol :P!. nice. must've been for that Lada GaGa special that went on :P. (just kidding)
:D!!!! Whoa! I didn't know that was on :P. I haven't seen it in forever, yet I've seen it a bunch :P. aw, but I want to talk to you too :P. you probably have important stuff you could be doing tooo.... :D
That's pretty awesome :D
just because it partly means no homework :P. And that stuff is tough sometimes
:P This means you're free to find a cure for cancer, or at least a less sticky alternative to superglue and ducktape :P
you could do anything :D!. And I probably could too if this homework wasn't totally restricting me :P  lol 
by the way, I'm exaggerating a bunch :P. :P. been there, done that..
Anythings not so great :P. Actually it's awesome. maybe. I like anything :D
because it's basically everything :D. :D! Anything with you is nice too. let's go fly a kite :D. and play lego star wars!. and I go somewhere where I can stop saying ridiculous stuff that I don't even know the meaning of. I'll*. :P
:P
Me either..
It means I can't say anything right.... And I'd be the least busy if it involved you :P
I'd just have to get the 'go ahead'. :P well at least it sounded okay to the person who matters (:
no :P but if I was they would totally judge what I'm saying. like I am :P  . :D. 'go ahead's are cool. how much are we supposed to run today?. :P
whoa o.o okay. :P. maybe playing wii sports can count?
:P lol . I. don't think I've ever played that with you yet :P
:3 I love you (:. sorry :P
:D! I'd love playing with you anyway. :D oh nos, I forgot I left a burner on o.o
:P lol it's okay, my mom just told me and got it :P. otherwise I wouldn't have remembered. she can be the hero :P. saving the 'good' frying pan from utter and complete burn-age. :P
aw (: . Thanks (:. And you helped in mine :P. best sidekick/ boyfriend ever (:

:D ah, maybe I will go do that studying/ homw=eworrk. homework**
maybe I'll just find out what mendacious means :P. :D!! and I totally want to play with you! :D
maybe when my living room is more free :P
:P !!! . those are totally possible too :P. lol when good ghouls go bad :D!

Crazy stuff O.o

No way :P. but have an awesome post-thanksgiving :D (:

I wanted to say 'and maybe i'll get to see you today! :D' but I don't want to deter you from anything else :D. you're amazing :D!
(: :D! Random, but I liked paper macheing with you :D. And that would be cool :D
mendacious=untruthful. (like the spanish mentir!) :P one down. . :D. aw (: I'm glad I could help!. You're soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo amazing (:. and I'm sooooooooooo lucky :D. And thankful :P. for everything

It doesn't look too, too bad, I'm just terrible at starting :P 
Present what you thought about your learning styles and preferences and your perceptions about distance learning courses before you took the Questionnaire. You may be creative in your format. You could use bulleted lists, a graph, a word web, images with labels...some way to communicate your thoughts.  Compare the descriptions of the characteristics of each learning style to what you wrote about yourself prior to taking the test. Were the descriptions "spot on", not like you at all, somewhere in between? Explain your answers.  How does what you discovered about yourself as a learner impact how you perceive distance learning courses? Can you anticipate areas where you will need to work harder or differently to be successful? What types of learning activities would you like to experience in the VASTS online course? How do those relate to the type of learner you are?. It's like, a journal entry I suppose :P. And thank you for your belief :D. aw :D I like that song lyric, by the way
:D 
You're all I need (:. lol oh totally
:P ah, I guess they just want it in an "orginaized format"? :P . lol hmm.. they didn't say anything in particular against it though
lol :P oh totes
thank you :D
sorry if I don't rap it though :P the rubric doesn't criteria-rize it. :D lol yes!. it's easier I suppose
oh, I get it :P. lol
ooh :D I could draw pictures!. And then put some labels underneath
in "an organized manner" that "demostrates deep self-thinking and awareness" :P. aw, well thank you :P. lol doodle-y. I'll go start :D (hopefully)!
:D!!! I hope so :D (:. though I'm not as good as drawing as you
:D lol I'd love to see you too (:. so I'll work efficiently :D to the best of my ability. (: And it's okay, it's not selfish because I'd love to see you too :D lol you'd be doing me a favor :P (: You're really good at suggestions and helping too (:. bye Peter :D (:

What did that note mean, that you left today?. And were you alright? like, at practice and everything?
:/ What was wrong?
I care about you and everything that has to do with you, but I'll try not to be thattt clingy :P
that strange, I felt like it was the other way around :P. I'm sorry I made you feel like that though :/
Is there a way I can not?. like.. what did I do?. sorry that I don't know..
you are the right guy, that's exactly what I was thinking when I read that not :D. note*. :/ I'm sorry you felt alone and i'm sorry I caused it/couldn't stop it.
What happened to lonesome being buried in some yard faraway? :P. far away*
Well the Earth is round I suppose.. . :/ sorry. I re-read through the notes you gave me today, and I always smile at those little illustrations (: Especially the ones of you and me.. being all tangled up :P
(: We should do it more often :P
as would I :D!. Bunches and bunches and honey bunches of oats and bunnies :D
:D!!!. no way, not if I can find a tackier one :D Making the one that you find the 'second' tackiest sweater to ever be a sweater :D

I think you're perfect ;D. :D* whoops :P. not winking. And you're useful for someone to talk to and be with. (: Paying for things shouldn't be why you're useful at all.. That's especially why I should pay you back (:
Money's just a thing though, and I should pay for my own stuff anyway :D. no way, that was for fun :D
no way o.o I wouldn't even know what to do with it
I'd probably just give it back :P. but first.. I'd fold it into a bunch of dollar origami. :D
:P lol noooo It's okay. give it to your parents or something. to pay for electricity :P. !! ooh!! :D!! surprise them and pay the bills
I'm sorry.. but I liked mowing lawns with you :D. We should do it more often :P. And to be honest, I don't think I did all that great a job. I liked making shapes though! :D

:P 
yeah!! snow angle distraction!!. oh nos :P I did it too :P. Angel***. Or maybe that was all just a big distraction.... to tell you that I love you (:
Then call me average (: so long as I get to be with you. :D. ah, brb I gotta go grab dinner :P. And it is _not_ a hot pocket :P even though I used the word grab

hey, it's my opinion of you :P There's no changing that without some serious puppy-kicking or family-eating :P. :D bye :D!!1. !*
:P lol because that's the only way I could not like you . lol :P oh yeah, that one's a definite negative... (:. sorry though, I can stop if you want. :D bye

you're so so cool :D. o.o adobe illustrator is so hard... :P I may resort to paint
aw :P. !!. still here. I think I do need help..
so.. I have this outline... but I don't know how to color it in or anything  o.o
yups :D
okay :D. now?
oh yeah, I have the pen path.. but I don't know what to do with it :P
it's all grayed out... :P I think I did something wrong. but I have a pen path.. and that's all :P
oh, I drew it on the program. :D
well.. I tried :P
:D okay got it
lol I was gonna be like..  "highlight?"
oooohhh :D!. make is there. I clicked it
okay :D I clicked it
yay :D
color guide is open
ohh :D that too. now what?. sorry
whoaa
aw.. I clicked it.. but it stayed white o.o
yup. I think... ohh hold on
yeah, I do :P
still white o.o. sorry... ahh sorry 
maybe.. there's a brownie color on top.. and then underneath it's a gray square with a red line through it :P
oh. hmm
but the one on top has stuff in it?
whoa o.o. but but.. then you'll see it :P
hmmm. :P ah it's okay
it sounds like too much trouble. ah um.. I"ll figure out something
but thank you :D
now it's um.. a gray square with brown around it. lol :P It's okay. thank you though
I just wish color would come out :P
yeah... and then I click... and then it's white o.o
yeah :/. :P sorry
both of them have the same color :P
ah.. it's just.. I don't want to show you the thingy quite yet
lol it works on the other sketch though.. :P. I made a circle and colored it in.. but the other one doesn't :(
ooohhh that could be it!
they all look like they meet.. but hmm..
is it okay if some of the paths got all overlapped?
like, I tried to fill in all the lines, so I overlapped some stuff because I didn't know how to delete it :P
hmm.. I don't see any gaps... maybe i'll just be blank forever... o.o. life is hard :P
ohhh. ait!. wait* :P. whoops
I was totally in 'outline'. then I went to preview
and it was all like.. . kaboom o.o
yes :P. whoops. now I feel silly
:P sorry. about that
you helped a lot :D!. is there anyway to get the color spectrum guy bigger?
whoa . awesome :P thanks
it does :D. I'll try my hand at the rest. but when I do trace the scanned thingy. how do I get rid of the background later?
command?. oh cool :d. :D*. got it
ohh okay. :P you're good, I got it
but um.. last question.. :D. how do I get out of the paint guy thingy?
yeah
nah, I want to draw more lines so I can paint them
ohhh
whoa.. okay cool :D. hmm.. I used the eyedropper tool to change colors.. and it made my whole thingy that color o.o
ohh. whoops :P
got it :d. :D*. you're so helpful :P
obviously I've never done this before :P
:D! yay. hmm.. how come the merge button doesn't always show up?. sorry for all the questions..
I added a pen mark, but it didn't quite show up..
ohhh. okay :d. :D*. that's it. you're good at this :D
it is pretty fun :D. but a little longer than drawing by hand :P. lol :P it's like... I drew it on paper... but now... it's like a whole new game o.o
really?
:D. that's pretty cool. you're fast :D. hmm... is there any way to make a more perfect circle? :P. I drew one... but it's a little lumpy..
whoaaaaa. that's way better than my circle :P
:P depends who you talk to. wait.. um.. where's the shape tool? :P
is it in the shape of a square?. :P
whoa o.o. that's not a circle.. it's giant crazy set of lines o.o :P. lol
oh, you're good :P. it was found
no, you're perfect :D. and now it totally looks like something!!!!!!. I'm so excited :D
:D lol :P did it not go well?. you're good at teaching stuffs :D. and you know your stuffs :D. (:. and the screenshare was a good idea too, I'm just being all secretive :P. hmm.. what color should the ornament string be?
:P lol oh kay :D. I like your visions too :D. lol I'm so zoomed in that when I scroll down with the bar, I loosse the image :P
:P!!! I know!. it's like.. where'd everything go? o.o. is there anyway to save the pen path and start a new one?. or is that just crazy? :P. sorry for all the questions
like.. hmm.. I'm afraid if i delete the pen path, I might have to redo it later if I need it.. but then.. it's all tangled up with lines. ohhh whoa :D. how do I deselect it?
oh... but then it's all like.. there o.o in the background. when I move my mouse over it :P. sorry :P
it's okay :P I'll keep going
lol I messed up so many times that when I fill something in now, I have to click in a bunch of different tiny spaces :D
it's so professional. oh yay :D. oh whoops :P I dragged it and everything came with it. I think I can do it with it there though :D. sorry, I probably sound really silly :P
I sound like :P a rookie
um... sorry for all the questions... but um..
aw (: thanks... um.. how do I delete some of the pen path, but keep the rest?
! there's one of those?
:D!!!!!!!!!!!!1. this helps so much!!!

but you're really easy to miss, y'know? :3
:P aw (: . I feel like I'd be easy to get tired of. It's so weird, this winter break feels different...
Maybe it's that too
I was hoping for snow defintiely :D. definitely*. and no way... I don't know what it is, but normally break is all nice and relaxing, and I wake up early and have time for everrryyything and to just chill out and do fun stuff with people. But I feel like I don't have time for anyyyytthing--the day goes by way to quickly and I still have bunches of homework :( . way too quickly**
hmm. really? it's not just me then? !!!! I think it's the lack of snow for sure then.. :P It changes everything. or maybe there's just too many responsibilites
!!!! :D I totally wanted to do that today, but I had to go to a different theater. :(
nah, it was Sherlock Holmes
The guy with the pipe and the hat and the magnifying glass :D. I missed the second half, because I fell asleep :P but it was pretty good. They went a pretty crazy with the slow-mo! :D. :P

aw :D Well that makes it more fun I suppose. You were lots of help. Thank you so much Peter.. I wouldn't've known where to start
I don't think so :/ You helped out a lot. and I hope it's otherwise.. I'm really really wishing I'll get to see you before than, and make do some fun stuff with you. I'm making that video tomorrow and in the morning I suppose

I thought I told you, silly, You're never a waste of time. (:. :/. and I don't think I'll see him
just to catch up :/ . maybe eat some ketchup too..
no, it just sounds like "catch up" 
it does make your hands pretty soft.
It's okay.. :D
I really hope I get to see you, Peter :/. :'(
maybe if I finish the lyrics up tonight, then I can film it in the morning and edit it on sunday.... then I'll have time to see you... and I could even get my room ready so we can play wii games in my room with the projector... it'll be fun :D
I guess I shouldn't either :/. can I tell you something really really silly?
I got home today.. and :/  I can't stop crying.. I don't even know why, because I never do.. :/ I'm sorry..                    . and maybe we could have sparkling cider too..
I don't know :/ I just can't stop being sad :(
It went away when I saw you.. but then I got home and :(
only right before I left when my mom was saying stuff about New Year's :/ but I don't know why I still am... It's okay though. It'll stop eventually, right?. I like talking to you... It's nice
noo, not at all :/. I'm sorry.. I probably shouldn't've told you, it'd be silly to trouble you over nothing.
I'm fine :D I'm probably just overwhelmed with homework is all.. . aw, it's okay, tomorrow would be better at least, I'm really not very presentable.. You're really amazing Peter
:P. aw I love you. (:
aw (: thank you so much for wanting to, but it's okay. I wouldn't want to make my mom more upset or anything.. just talking to you helps :D
But I'm still curious, what happened in Kent's Square when you time jumped? :/
Awwww :(  but :/ Why? What made you sad? :'(
You don't have to be sorry about that, or anything. But, maybe I can help? . Or at least be here to talk to?. Aw :/ I wish I could give you a hug and keep you warm
Anything at all I can do or say? I'd really like to :/. If I could..
Are you better now? Or is it still bothering you at all?
I could help? If i knew what it was. ?*
I'd still like to help either way, and if you ever do need someone to talk to, I'm always here.  Even if it's just for a nice game of thumb wrestling or tag or something, or just a hug or two. 
You've already helped so so so much :D. With everything.. you're always there to help. (: You're so perfect. You're the bestest boyfriend and bestestfriend and sillyhead ever :P
aw, okay :D G'night to you too, I really hope I can help with whatever made you sad. I might've said it before, but you being sad is one of the worst things ever.. And thank you for all the help and the good luck (:
I think it is :/ And then, on the other hand, you being happy is the bestest thing ever :D!. aw.. y'know what? I'm gonna say, see you tomorrow. :D And not jinx anything
That'd be really nice :D I was looking for a nicely sized one. Would you be free tomorrow at all?

aw, it's not better?. :P
I wanna do homeworks with you :D
the wrong format?
aw :( what format was it in? And you might have to point out the obvious for me with that 'you know." :P
ohhh okay.. so would you like to do homeworks? :D. lol sorry, I could be missing your point.
yay :D
homework is not necessary? :P. lol I don't know why you'd want to be with me on a nice day like this
:P you are something that is more than words can ever say.
Well, maybe one day i could describe it in words, but they wouldn't do you justice (sorry for the cliche saying :P)
:D. yay for homework :D
I'm not sure... It's not so great.. but the possibly spending time with you is? :P

o.o from your brain?
ohhh.. what about the various revisions?. :D

:D G'morning. :D. You're cool.
I'm really really good! It's all sunny and pretty outside. how are you?
Whoaaa... That's pretty crazy :P. what was your nightmare about?
o.o Whoa. Maybe it's a sign that we shouldn't watch Paranormal Activity . and should instead watch unicorns having adventures
:P lol nah, I'm kind of curious what it's about.. I hear there is a dog in one of them :D!
ohh okay :P. since you haven't seen it?
are you sure it wasn't just like.. invisible? :P. or under a blanket?
lol Well that's good, because that means you won't be expecting all the scares :P
lol, that sounds familiar.. I think that happens to me during those parts where random things jump out and scare you :P
si si :D
me too.. hmm.. what kind of food is good to eat while watching a horror movie?. Gummi Bears?
yay :D. That sounds good. lol throw it at the screen? :P
Sounds quite perfect, since gummy bears stick and all.. :D
lol :P well that makes it extraordinarily perfect if you add you into it
but you do it so perfectly..? :P. lol sorry kidding. but I do think you're rather perfect :D!
or it's fact :D. I've never ever seen Spirited Away before.
lol apparently it's a good movie :D
lol :P I had thought I had seen it for forever.. but it turned out I was thinking of this other thing called "Grave of the fireflies" which was definitely one of the most tragic movies I've ever seen o.o
:P lol hmm.. maybe I just don't remember Spirited Away.. I remember the other one because it was really disturbing o.o. for a 7ish year old, at least
actually, I feel like it'd be even creepier if I watched it now.. :D!
lol what, are you friends with him on Facebook or something? :P
lol :P wow. I unfortunately do not?
yay :D!
And he'll be all like... :P. oh. you should bring him a scone?
lol is that why you gave me one? :P
psh, I bet he'd like it :D. he is a chemistry teacher after all.
o.o
oh, i see :P
Ooh, it does sound good :D. ish.. I will let you get to that :P
:D it's okay. :P but I think I should go on that run thingy
:D okay. oh wait.. oh, okay

I mean, there was some messing around in between, but yes. one whole hour.. :P
how far is that?. :P oh wow.. thanks.
benches and trees and monkey bars?. oh wow.. now I feel slow.. :P. what is that, like -1 mph+. ?*. oh wait, it would be approximately .85mph.. I'd say that's pretty good for me.
the intersection? yes.
I didn't go any further because I wasn't sure which way you would've gone :P
lol :P yay. the other way looks hot.

the thingy you're telling me? :D
ahh, you're so so so so cool (:. I think I have little butterflies floating everywhere. in my tum-may. :P. :P lol. sorry
o.o. the soggy twizzler tastes kind of like bread.. soggy bread of course
totally :P. lol :P wow.. it was weird... I just experienced that whole "don't like it much but can't stop eating it" feeling.. with the soggy twizzler :P
lol eat a lot of greek yogurt? 
:P psh, you should just add honey if you ever get stuck with it again. it takes away the um... yogurt-y flavor? :P
whoa!! That's really awesome :P was there more honey than yogurt?
lol yum. :D. wait, was it good?
:P sounds like.. a bunch of candy floating around in soda for a long time mixed with sugar.
but that might be a different kind of sweet.. I feel like.. you can choke on honey because the sweetness could make your throat close up o.o. bees can be harmful in more than one way? :P. lol honey is good though.. sorry. :P
oh definitely.
it's really okay, I started it anyway :P. you're sooo out of my league. I shouldn't even in my right mind be talking to you.. Someone could end up dead. O.o. Multiple someones.
in cliche ways.. :P
nah.. you're the higher league :P. Thank you so so so much for the sour patch kids! :D
they're so cool.. like you. you're cool for bringing them.. there's so way.. :D
It's hard to believe :P. ompossible even.. impossible :P*
aw, well I can wait :D. there are a few things I'd like to explain to you too :D. if I can
whoa, there's more than one thing? :P
That's almost exactly what I would say about you :P. or how I feel at least. You're just sooo soo cool and amazing and everything you do is sooo seemingly-perfect (:
Well I'd say you are (:!. hannah montana hadn't met you :P
o.o did you pull an Odysseus on her? :P 
psh, she doesn't know what she means when she says "Nobody's Perfect" then. :P. lol just kidding, I deeply respect that song; however, I'd say you're really close :D!
yup :D
(: I know, but I can't believe it... And sometimes I feel like.. . well... ah, I won't say it because it's mainly just negative... but do you kind of know what I mean?
well like.. I care about you a whole lot.. and I want you to be super duper happy and have the bestest and everything (sound cheesy yet?) :P..and sometimes I think, "Hey, I'm pretty sure I'm not the bestest for this guy. He's just soo soo cool and I'm just me." , and I try to be the bestest, but I still feel guilty for holding you back or something of the sort. Sorry.. It's very negative, and I know maybe some of it might not be true, but that's kind of how I feel when I'm ever hesitant. Or something. :P
aw yeah, I think I know. And thanks.. (:
I love you.. sorry :P. And you are :D
aw, no, :D you're so awesome.. And thank you. :D I love you for you and your superduper awesomeness (: (everything about you) :P . sorry.. I liked the way you said it :D
:P Oh, why thank you? :P. ahh, you're so so cool (:. should we get to sleep? :P
okay :D but nah, it's all in opinion right?. aw, I'm sorry about stuff too. You didn't do anything wrong at all though :D. It's weird but I, very honestly, love most everything about you. :D. actually, just everything*
:D really really
aw (:. (:
nah, not really :P I was just gonna talk about how cool you are again, and how I try, but I just can't stop smiling :P
:D (: that's a good song. and it totally applies.. And it's fine, I mostly just try to push it away. You're really reassuring too :D . sorry
aw, i'll try not to.. just promise me you'd tell me if you were ever unhappy with stuffs or anything?  and (this might be hippocritical) but you shouldn't feel like that because I'm quite convinced that I love you (:. I feel like you're the most special thing ever :D
by thing, I mean person of course :P
aw (: so, you wouldn't mind me invading your personal space? :P
lol yay :D you're way above everything.. well, most everything
aw, really really? :P. not even hugging?
lol :P you're way above food, I guess I meant sentimental things like family.. I kind of wasn't sure if you wanted me to
be all up in your grill. :P
Well, for future reference, I am very okay with thumb wars :P. lol whoa, the sneak attack ones were a little scary though
oh aw.. with the thumb wars? or in general? I'm sorry for both. :P I sort of wanted to hug you at times. sorry
you're still all warm (:
yay (:
aw... did you need a snuggie? :P
lol I think I have one somewhere..
:P. aw
lol :P
warm stuff is all warm and butterfly-y though. like you :D
aw.. :D it's fine, I can assure you that I won't be unfairly persuaded into hugging you :P. hugging you is nice though (:. It feels like... love (:. and warm stuff
:P all of the above. especailly the first one and second one and the other two :P. so basically, all of them :P
me too (: it's how I feel about you.. oh wait.. :P
I love you too (: Sorry I fell asleep :P
! Hi!!. :P
really really good :D I wish I had woken up a little earlier though :P how are you?
Just so I could get more stuff done--it feels like I'm missing out on the day :P

Oh yeah, thanks :P hmm, 2 hours and 40minutes isn't too late, right?

okay, good luck and stuff :D. I hope your day is very nice too!
wait.. a hole for what?
aw no.... In that case, I hope you don't find one :P unless it's in your best interest.
you're very definitely not bothering/annoying me :D. I'm sorry for stuffs too.. I haven't had toast in awhile... I think I might do that soon :P
I still really want to go to the pool con ti :P

:P I wouldn't want, but I guess there's stuff to do.. Still wish I could see you today :D
Trust me, you wouldn't. :D I'd want to see you, and if you ruined my day, it'd be silly to want to see someone like that :P
.. I didn't think so.
oh.. :/ I'm sorry 
I mean, we don't have to do stuffs... but I'd like to :D
You're really not :D. you're cooler than toast with strawberry jam on it!
lol ooh, or honey :D

whoa!
:P nah, you'll be fine. Your horoscope doesn't say anything bad
... oh really?. :P I don't believe you.
partly because you left out "day"
:P oh I see. noo, Murphy means well!. yay :D today!

thought you weren't going to show :P. you
:D Whoa, sewing again? . I'm really really good :D you?
:D! I was just guessing due to your recent activity. . Whoa cool! Didja see some cool stuff? :D I actually did some hiking myself, if you can believe it
:D still sounds cool! no bears though? :P
aw, that's too bad. But i'd say it's also lucky because some could be pretty scary I'd say :P. I hope you weren't wearing shorts; I learned that I probably should've gone in jeans today :P
aw :P no thorns though?
:D nice! I feel similarly. :P just kidding. I trust your hiking abilities. :D!!! oh my goodness. Guess where I went!
:P lol the Quarry! :D
It's out in the middle of nowhere :P you can see it on mapquest satellite  pretty well though :D  
whoa! :D
that sounds quite exciting
I would say I almost fell about 70 feet down a cliff; but I didn't ever go that close to the edge :P. lol don't even joke about the dying thing. Didja take any pictures? :D! ooh, I wanna show you some?
oh yeah :D! I guess it rained over there too. That sounds kind of cool :D. we should do some stuff tomorrow. ooh, I've been looking into a bike..
http://tinyurl.com/schwinnroadbikeblue  Being with you is my idea of a good day :D. oh, and that's the bike :P
I know!! :D I hope it's in my price range :P aw.. well I'd say as long as it works, it's good
:D I'd very much like to do something! :D
:D I'd really just have to ask! Hmm, what would you like to do? There are a whole lot of possibilites :P
:D oh, totoro and bad nickelodeon watching? :D ooh, there's also: bike riding, bonfireing, inappropriate frisbeeing, running?, and pool-going :D. bad nickelodeon movie*
:P I'll explain that to you in person
:P don't be, it's super fun.. yay :D. we have a whole summer to do it 
wow, i just counted my life savings of quarters and it's about 9 dollars :P
yay!. oh wait! I forgot my mitten stash1. !*
make that 13 dollars :P
enough for a bike? :P
I know! :P lol nice. it's cool though. that's what parents are for, right?. until we grow old and have to support them :P
:P something like that?. :D paying it forward?
aw :P lol I don't think I hiked quite as much as it sounds like you did :P. I hear ice helps?. or rest?. compression?. elevation? :P. lol 
:P lol may I ask how one falls so much while hiking?
ohh, I see.. loose rocks and such?
lol running?
neat-o
Well, I hope you're okay. ohh
I'd say that's pretty good :D! It sounds like fun stuff. oh man, I better go wash the bunny off my hands :P I can still smell it
yes. bunny.. That's all :P
oh my goodness no. O.o it did get pretty close to the car though.. lol basically, there was bunny, and I pet it.
yeah :D . it was sooo soft. like.. velvety
Whoa, really?
Oh, i did it in the meantime :P. It's fine. whoa, you should go pet my friend's bunny :D soo cute
lol :P . :D 
lol I love that smiley! :O it looks awfully surprised
I guess it's meant to :P. :D! I think being a hair-stylist would be a fun job :P
:P oh really? what did?
It's okay, guessing gives plenty of room for error. :P Are you ever going to catch on that I really like talking to you?. :D
ohhh :P lol
close I'd say
you shouldn't :D. I never think you are. :D!
ooh, did anyone camp out there?
yeah, that's what I meant too :D. oh yeah.. it might be dangerous to camp there :P
oh.. Well that's silly.
I feel like.. you shouldn't be so negative toward yourself. Like, you're a really awesome guy :D!. This sounds bad, but I'd say that there isn't anyone who thinks as badly of you as you do :(
case closed? :D
ah, well that's still silly :P Everyone I know loves having you around (including myself)
:/ . I'd say you're special.
Has anything ever caused you to feel like that?
...
Ah, I don't want to criticize that or anything, but I'd say the only bad thing about you would be that. :P hmm.. you know that old saying.. . goes something like..
:P okay.
Then why do you still not like yourself? :(
:P everything? what qualities do you like about other people? I'd say that you have at least half, if not all of the ones you could list
:P lol the answer sounds so simple then... but I like you around regardless :D!. It just makes me sad that it seems like that's what bothers you the mostest :(. or like, that's the only thing that's making you sad
for no reason? :P
sorry to assume
lol nah I bet you're not
oh.
would anything make you feel good enough? :P . is it possible?
well that's silly :P. Looking back, I think the only reason I ever felt not good enough back in 7th grade was because I couldn't talk to this one guy I thought was cool :P And now it just seems silly. maybe it's just a state of mind thing. maybe you gotta takes some risks :P. (not life threatening ones)
aw :/. well you make me happy.. . and I'd hate to be the problem :/
:P sounds a teensy bit like it. ooh!. maybe now would be a good time to show you that song
Well you shouldn't feel sad, right? :D
:D yay. you do too. !!!. Here is the acoustic version for your tastes :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdU0s6-KLA
you're special :D. I like you. .
:P :D Es good, si?. lol :P 
I know! :D I love it. my 7th grade soundtrack. :P. I think my friend Cara showed me this. and no problem :D just spreading the relatable music
:P lol I never paid that much attention to the lyrics. just the chorus is good for me :D. ooh, and my favorite line.. "Cause you're my dream, please come true :D". It's still a love song to me :P
:D and there always will be :D. and I don't know who him is, but if you mean the screamo band, I would agree :P
:D yay. no problem, that's what friends are for, I'd say :D
aw okay :P. Whoa, I just realized how much I like the non-acoustic version too :P
aw, sigh still?
wait.. feeling set apart? :P . and okay :D
what does it mean?
oh.. :/. aw.. I'm sorry :/
I'd say you're special :D if that's reassuring at all?. but actions speak louder?
aw :( . your heart?
aw :/. I'm sorry
lol :P "oh, no biggie. My heart's just breaking."
:P. anywho, I'll see you tomorrow I hope
yay :D I hope I am
nope, there'll be no fading away on your part if I can help it :P
:D yay. g'night then fine sir :P
(could you hear the bad british accent?). :P. G'night, Peter
:P If you know what a poppet is, I'd suggest that :P. I'm not quite sure :P but it sounds very british. You're really cool :D. Aw, did you already leave? :P. sorry, anywho... um.. bye :D
lol :P that's fine, really. I hope you have a super duper nice day too :D!. :P awesome. 10 years of my life=$29 worth of change total. ooh, I gotta go clean the gutters now, so call me if you are free to do something and hopefully I will pick up :D
oh hi :D. noo don't say that :P
o.o whoa, really?. I've never done it before :P. I'll try though I think. you "caught" one? :P
:P lol how early in your life were you cleaning gutters?
oh awesome :P I probably would've fallen off the ladder
:P used your dad's cherrypicker?
that sounds nicer than a ladder :D I was thinking about doing it that way instead :P. to aviod falls
nah, I haven't started yet :P. but I'm definitely going
lol this is my attempt to earn money for that bike :P
totally. :P.  hmm, how much are regular bikes?
aw. :P I mean, I guess google could tell me. oh.. ish? :P
:P That sounds like a nice price
whoa, cool.. :P I'm not sure if the one I'm interested in is reasonably priced, but it seems like it'd have vintage value or something :P. I don't know anything about bikes, but I'd say a 1975er in good conditiion could be worth more :P
yes! :D. I'm kind of excited :D. the lady said it was passed down from her grandmother :P
aw okay... and yay :D
how has your day been so far?
oh, yay :D. I had toast. :D
yes! :D. you'd make it even better!
you last longer than toast :P
Oh, it might be hard to believe, but you are. :D
:P yay!. That means you're even more crazy amazing though! :D
well It's more than true :D. ...It's fact.
Tomato, to-ma-to. :D

You're helping me be very productive :P
:P yes.. I'll go do that

:P. un poco
:P I'm mostly fine.. :P 2/3 doneish
yes :P. I think
yay :D. do anything cool?
play sushi cat recently? :P
:P yuups.
Well that's good, because you're not bad at all :D so your wish came true?
aw :( . well I bet the messed up version is even better? :D. and okay--I'm almost done!
:D arighty cool. lol it's fine though, I bet whatever you're doing is just as important. :P I'm not even doing this out of the kindness of my heart--it's for money :P Therefore, I'm just giving in to selfishness, whereas you are being a kind and giving person most likely :P. yeah.. brb. for awhile
:D I think I'm back now
yay hi!
I'm really good :D excited and stuff! wbu?
:D that's pretty cool. Still available to do stuffs?
aw man, okay :P any plans in particular?. think it'd be weird if I tagged along?. I wouldn't want to be all third wheely or something
:D hmm, what were you thinking you'd do?
aw, that's silly :P it's summer! :D everyone should be all free and having fun
:D
:P oh awesome! that sounds like a pretty good time :D hey, I have some sour patch kids this one guy gave me--do you like those? :D
yay :D and yay (:. whoa, really? :P well you can have a bunch of these if you want
:D if you can handle the sourness, you can have the majority :D
I'd really want to :D I just gotta clean up some stuffs
yay :D. I'm excited :D
:D and seeing you!. and watching movies . and playing tony hawk 4 hopefully :D
:P lol it's fine, maybe I can catch on quickly :P
yay :D. I'll go ask my mom/clean up dead plant material/ change :P
oh, have you eaten dinner yet?
:P oh.. hmm.. we have a tonnn of leftovers from within the past few days, but I'm not sure how much you'd like them :P. hmm... :D pizza?
yay :D. aw :(. :P poor tomatoes
:P oh wow
ohh
sorry for the possible surprise then :P
:P lol I suppose so.. but tomatoes are meant to be enjoyed :P it's what they live for. tomatoes don't want to go to college, they'd rather be made into a spaghetti sauce or put in a nice deli sandwich :D
yay :D. it does.
oh yeah :D sure!. then hopefully I'll see you soon. bye for now :D
still want to do something? :P
aw.. it is kind of late.  :D but yeah, you can comeover whenever
yay :D I do

:D oh hi! lol I was just typing you a message :P 
:P so basically, I can't talk to you for awhile because I'm talking to you :P. oh, no problem :P It was fun getting to see it again myself. Oh my, I don't think I'll ever get that panda's Jamaican accent out of my head. :P lol That movie may have been better remembered as a child. I think the Totoro couch would be so awesome still! :D
 yes!. yay :D oh, I was only planning on sending a quick message then going off to eat my health-filled breakfast :P but I could stay for a while. Any plans for you today?
:P lol well fine, but I'll only agree because cold toast is hard to spread butter on :P
Talking to you is very great :D lol oh, you're one of *those* people? :P. just kidding
lol this inspires me to create totoro themed furniture :P
:P and I was definitely kidding
someone once told me that talking to yourself is a sign of genious.
genius* . aw, I'm sorry
:P lol fine!  I tried though :D
but did I try hard enough?
oh no, what'd I do? :P
okay, phew, I was worried for a second :P

:P psh, I'm willing to take a chance! :D See ya around!
yay toast :D. If you were wondering, it didn't get tooo burnt :P
it was at a decent crunchiness :D. I enjoyed it :D
oh definitely :D. How are you doing?
I'm pretty good :D. yesterday was awesome :D
:D because I got to see you and play tony hawk 4 :D!
:P Well I'd say both were fun :D! it'd be so cool to unlock a bunch more places to play :P
:P psh, cheats are cheating. and cheating is bad. and nah, it could never ever get boring, right? :P
ohhh. aw :P. they should have co-op :P
Oh yeah, then I can get really good and surprise you when we play together :P
It could be boring if you're not around though :P. :D I feel like going biking today

lol nah, I could use some help actually :P
You honestly shouldn't feel like that, you're fun to be with and stuff :D!
Maybe not necessarily :/ but I'd just want you to feel happier
Whoa, I just found my mom's coin collection! :D. aw :/ wait, what just happened?
:/ oh no. This sounds bad. Do you wanna come over and play frisbee/ talk about it? :D
:D Well the 2nd one is easy to fix, but if you're not able to, that's okay too
yay :D
oh, it's very very fine if you can't :P I was just hoping to try and cheer you up or something
aw :/ was that a 'no' then?

:P . hmm. ah, I'm good for now :P
sorry :P 
wait... you just..
:D I would come, and then not run, but that sounds like, unaccpetable
ohh. I see.. :P lol maybe my huckleberry running experience just wasn't the bestest last time
aw, sorry I wasn't in the right place at the right time :P
:D I'm up for it
I mean, I just gotta ask. and if I'm gonna run, I should probably lay off the sour patch kids :P

um.. running? :P. or walking
:P lol. nah, it's fine. thanks though

yeah :D. I like when that happens :P
:D sounds like a candy slogan
lol maybe not the whole day; it'd say the excitement lasts about 2 seconds :P. actually, maybe it varies with amounts.. If you're finding hundred dollar bills in your pants on a regular basis, I'd say that'd make you a pretty happy person :P
:P nah, there's lots of things, right?

aw :P maybe not the whole day hopefully. :P I don't think it could be the other way around :D you're too cool of a person
:D or impossible. ah, I should let you get running before it rains :P. we need to run sometime :P. lol 2 miles everyday
:D yay, is it good?
sorry, I think my facebook chat may be slow--but have a super duper awesome day and everything. um.. cheesecake? :D
ohh, i see :P
you didn't do anything to be sorry about :D. you're reallly cool. bye for now (: have fun with the cheesecake
:D It'll be amazing if you made it. bye :D you're super super duper amazing. see ya around
:P oh hi
Whoa, I hope your thingy in the oven was fine :P. nah, it's fine :P I wasn't doing too much
ah, okay :D that's good then.  . It's fine, you're really not a bother :D!
yups, positive :D
aw :/ I'm sorry.. And I'm sorry I said you were bad at pool :P. I was really just kidding mostly
awww :( noo I'm sorry :P You were really good then?. well. I mean, I wouldn't say you were pro, but considering your experience, I'd say you're actually better than me. and I totally wanted to talk to you
aw :/ I'm sorry. I really wasn't that busy though. just my mom was around and we were doing stuffs. I'm sorry though
:/
okay:/ 
wait, really? What'd you say?
! :P sounds important to be. me*. what was it?
:P I'm kind of curious whether I heard it or not though. I don't remember you saying anything silly.
nah, it totally matters
I just wish I could remember.. I was pretty distracted in all the calls I had with you :/ sorry
no way, I liked talking to you :D. And I called a couple times myself if I remember. I'm really really sorry though. I wish I knew what you said
for everything :/. not being listenative enough
for whatever bothered you and made you seem kind of sad :(
ohhh wow, I'm sorry. I should've let you go earlier :/ I didn't know
okay, that's good :D. lol, impromptu track practice? :D
sorry :P I'm bad with jokes
It's fine, like I said :P bad with jokes. :D I'm so excited for summery stuff. and buying stuff from random people over craigslist :P
It's alright, I just wish I could've helped at all :P . :/ what went wrong besides the whole waking up early?. no more gutter-incidents I hope?
sorry for indirectly starting some of those :/. not a morning person? :P
sorry for keeping you up late too. :P your party?
dream party?
wait, doesn't grass have dirt in it anyway? :P lol sorry. ooh, was the awesome-flavored advil handy?
really? mine seems to have a bunch underneath.. though I wouldn't exactly call my lawn manicured :P. aw, well we could make some cool cheesecakes sometime :D!
lol whoops sorry :P I'm probably asking too many questions at once
yay for landscaping :D. That's my other future wanted job. just not.. as in.. not the digging part :P. just the design part
:P lol too much aspiration could just lead to nothing though. aw :/ I'm sorry about that too. I feel like I should've known or something. Or that it was my fault for insisting you stay. Oh my goodness, when I think about it, I caused at least 80% of your problems today :/. indirectly for some. but still :P. that's pretty bad
no way. the sleep deprivation probably caused some of the cheesecake stuff, and the working wouldn't've been so bad if you had gotten to sleep earlier :P
maybe you were so sleep deprived, that your eyes didn't read the recipe right :P. and maybe I shouldn't be so likable :P lol if that is the case
sorry :P I'm just being silly mostly. psh, my sour cream was perfectly healthy :P
lol just kidding though :P It may have made it worse. but I did eat it..and live :D
o.o. :P
yay :D
that's good :D!
:P for making your day off?. you're welcome :P
oh, aw, well you being happy is pretty awesoem :D. awesome*

I'm pretty positive I'm going to that lock-in :P
:D yay byebye

:P aw okay. it's fine though. nap attacks are fun!
:P whoa, that has happened before :P but no, you never ever bore me to sleep :P. rather, I would rather talk to you than go to sleep properly, but am unable to stay awake :P

lol :P Nice. Well, I was counting in my head. But now I'm kind of wondering if we started from the same day. :P I can't wait for Winnie the Pooh to come out! :D And I hope you're still having the time of your life over in Massanuttin. :D I like you. Goodnight and sleep well (hopefully you're not stuck on the couch) :D!
It comes out on July 15th! :D  Aw, sorry I missed you, I guess leaving my Facebook up was a bad idea. :P You're sooo cool. :D And I'd say it's bad that you really want to talk to me. I'm just like.. me.  I think I'm really really wishing that your trip was only 5 days right about now; I hope that it's going rather swimmingly (waterpark) :P even with the couch-sleeping.  I kind of miss you wayy more than I was expecting to, so I really really can't wait to see you. :D You're sooo perfect. (: Have fun and whatnot. :P I wish they offered mattress surfing at waterparks--there are really no legit places to try that out. :P Sweet dreams, Peter. (: . now; but I hope that*  Proper semi-colon usage? :P
! :P. Oh my goodness, I drove on a road yesterday! :P. It was the scariest but funniest thing ever and my emergency blinkers were on for some of the time :P. :P And I think I'm gonna go pick that fruit that tastes like leaves tomorrow, so that should be very purple-y and stuffs. I hope you take pictures from Massanuttin, because I really can't imagine what it's like there. :P It could be like.. a Native American village for all I know.
Oh yay. :D 4 days doesn't sound like too long! Maybe when you get back we can play frisbee or something. :D If you want to. (: You're so so awesome! :D I can't tell if you're online or not, but I kind of do have to go drive right now ish..but it can wait I think :D! 
:P It was like... interesting. And I went wayyy under speed limit and swerved a bunch and had trouble with blinkers. :P But I only stalled once
(exclaimation point). oh, why thank you
yay :D
Are you having fun and enjoying the possible native american village?. by the by? :D that's such a cool expression thingy
the expression or the village? :P. So.. it is fun? :D!
ohh okay
The word resort sounds very cool. :P. Aw, well maybe fun fun is there today :D!
Oooohhh!! I bet there's a lazy river! :D I love those :P. The only thing missing sounds like.. a beach and the ocean. :D!
Oh, it's fine. :P I'm not even quite sure what you'd be sorry about.
Everything you say is always really really nice :D!
no way, not at all. :D You + annoying = fruitcake. because fruitcake doesn't make sense? :P
:P lol next they're gonna start putting vegetables in cake and calling it 'vegetablecake'. o.o Have you ever heard of a meatcake?
It does :P Maybe I was thinking of crabcake. You're soooooo cool! :D!
sorry :P
I'm just like, talking to you, and it's like.. amazing! :D!
nah, I'm not even wearing sunglasses
You're soooo sooo amazing! :D And you don't need sunglasses because your eyes are so cool that they can deflect UV rays on their own! :P. or something.
Nah. :P 
:P Whoa, french now? :P
aw.. well um.. um.. :P um..
pour les coiffures abimees :P.. That is french, I believe
It was also on the back of some hair conditioner :P
I should like, let you go do more fun stuff :D! Where'd you find wi-fi? :P
Awesome!!
:D you should go in the lazy river :P. with one of those awesome intertube thingys :P
lol make sure you don't get stuck with the kids sized one
Awesome :D! what better day than to be lazy in a river? :P lol jk, your thingy sounds very cool.
Aw, sigh?
but why the sigh?
:P the roads will wait for me
noooooooooooooo you're soooo cool :D!. oh my goodness :D! meatcake! http://www.blackwidowbakery.com/demo/meatcake/ :P
Aw, but the sigh?
not a sad sigh though, i hope?
okay, sorry, I think my computer just glitched a little :P. but school doesn't start until like... August! :D
but... freedom from you would be like.. un-freedom. because it's sad and lonely :(
because I haven't seen you in like 4 days or so, and that never happens :(. And you're fun to be with and play with and stuffs. you're soooo soo amazing :D!. I don't think you realize quite how amazing you are. :P
not the way that you are--there's just something about you that's like.. hmm.. special? :D
but you're a special guy :D
Most of it is still a mystery to me too, but I think at this point I could put up a reasonable argument for it. :D. but driving is scary, and I started a countdown too :P
yups :D . And people only countdown to stuff their excited for.. I still have to try your cheesecake too! :D. if that offer still stands
they're* sorry if you're frowning at my bad grammar. 
oh, and that's fine :P. yay :D. oh yeah :D! we can make it together. once I pimp out the kitchen :P
if that's possible
!! :P funny thing about that statement... just kidding :P no playstations in my oven. That would be very X-ibit though.
yay :D. and some subwoofers in the vegetable crispers for when you're feelin' fresh. :D
:P. I know this doesn't mean much on Facebook, but I really really want to tell you that I love you. (:. sorry
yay (:
ohhh :P lol I was thinking it sounded familiar, but I wasn't sure.
I know it in Spanish though :D. I think.. :P
yups :D And I know there are a bunch of different meanings for it.
for different situations?
aw yay :D (:. It's still all warm and fuzzy sounding though :D
yay :D!
nah, I think we could arrange something :P. if possible
ohh okay. well, I can wait. :D I'm patient and stuffs (sometimes).. And as long as I know you're having fun and stuff :D
yay :D 3 days
aw.. is the food good at least? :P
yay :D!. I love vacation food!
yeah :D! It's so much chiller and more relaxed :P
you're sooo great. I don't know what I'd do if the 'just friends' thingy had gone through. I wanna say I would've died, but that sounds completely overexaggerated.  . You're just really really perfect and amazing (:
aw (:
I'm not quite sure either. But you are so so so great :D
And I'd wait for longer if I had to, though I don't quite know if that applies. :P. /is relevant. . You're just awesome and stuff. :D!
(: :P that's a silly if, because it's always gonna be yes. :D
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O.o!!!!!!!1. You went here? http://massanuttenvacation.com/massanutten_resort/summer_tubing.jpg. :D!!!

It looks like.. a giant slip and slide :D
yay :D. are people allowed to skip out on the intertubes? :P
ah, yeah. I guess you're right :P . hmm.. lots and lots of baby shampoo then?
yay :D
aw.. I do too and have, but it's really not too long, right? And there's still plenty of summer left :D!
:P It does sound corny, but I feel very similarly, so I won't make fun of you for it :P
(: . You're the coolest
:P psh, not from where I'm standing
:P!!!! the one with the airport scene? :P
Oh it sounds wonderful :P. lol maybe I can record it....... :P sorry, mostly kidding unless you weren't.. :P
:P It'd be rather embarrassing if I said it was already scheduled to record..
That way sounds nicer :D. I should go drive/ eat dinner :D! And you should have fun with your vacation food. :D!. In a *resort* :P
lol it's so fancy sounding awesome :D. wait.. fancysoundingawesome*
:D
Yay :D Can't wait. 
(: aw. I really really like you too. (: I'm so so glad that I'm yours.
(: I'm not :P but you most definitely definitely are :P . And you're soooo fun to talk to :D. sorry
I think that website I've showed you has inspired me to make a meat cake :P. (: and thanks. That means a bunch (:
:P lol cake will never "spoil anyones appetite" ever again. I think.
Aw, they didn't send? :(
Oh, you must have me confused with someone else :P like yourself.
:P lol it's fine. computers get tourettes sometimes too. Well then.. you are too :D!
I should too :D
yay for giant slip and slides :D. and native american villages. byebye :D

aw :P I left my Facebook thingy up again.. :D G'night to you too though. :D!
(: Just what I was thinking about you. :P
ooh :D! I can tell it's a song because it's in quotations?. :D you make me smile too (:. hmm.. do you prefer closets or dressers?
:D! Unless you're a contortionist. 
yay for Today :D
:P lol
maybe it's a really reallyyyy roomy dresser?. oh, it just became today.. :P
:P!. whoa! that's crazy. it's like you're in California..
:P. whoa... You know what's weird?
:P no, you're perfect :D. actually, depends what weird is.. but did you know... That it's always today? o.o
:P That sounds kind of ominous. But something like that.
That's crazy :P. I never knew.. well... never thought about it :P. Or I did..but forgot. :P
Or is it? :P... hmm. I'm cleaning my room :D!
yeah! :D
I always run out of hangers though :(. I don't know where they go :P
one day I'm just going to find like 50 of them under my bed
:D!!! because he's jealous of my closet?
!! It all makes sense! :P. Does anyone actually hang up their pants? :P like in that one Jimmy Neutron episode?
:P What if they're just jeans?. Can jeans possibly wrinkle?
really? :P!
wait.. are you telling me.. that you hang up your pants? :P
until you discovered wrinkle-free pants?. ohh :P. Sadie Hawkins Dance.. In my khaki pants... :P sorry. I don't hear that word often enough
I don't think I could've spelled that o.o. That weird kh combo is just crazy.
That's pretty awesome. :D . You're so cool :P. Whoa o.o
This is weird.. I thought Robert Hurd was someone else o.o. but he's not.
do you know him?
Me either :P. Yet his name is superduper familiar.. Didja have a nice lazy day? :D
:D!!! But walks are soo cool. :D!. :P lol sorry.. That sounds a little scary though o.o
o.o is it that bad?. oh no.. is this like the squirrel thing?
can't be worse than a sheep, right? :P
a pregnant sheep? :P
Maybe if you never ever think about it ever again, it'll go away. :P. lol sorry, that's an awful philosophy.. maybe you could just hold a private funeral?
(: :P It has to be something true though. :P. like um..
Strawberries taste like.. strawberries? :D
(: aw.. I like you. :D
And I still have stuffs to say in person :P
!!!!! oh my goodness! I just made loud pops :P. because I left bubble wrap on my floor :P. And I keep accidentally stepping on it. but aw :(. pretend it was just bubblewrap :P
O.O That's scary. you did say you were in a hotel though, right? :P. Peter?. You're still there, right? :P. sorry.. :P. you can't just leave after saying something like that.. :P. ...
yay :D
oh that's fine. :P. o.o nooo it's not haunted. :P. And if it is, it's just casper.
o.o oh no. Maybe it's just like, a vaccumm seal or something though
Don't worry, you're completely safe :D
hmm..
That's kind of scary actually. But you're definitely safe.. lol :P. my arms aren't very safe
noo you're fine :D. trust me. (:
wait, where is everyone else? :P
and it sounds like you're in the dark or something. aw yay (:. I trust you bunches too
That's kind of concerning, but I bet it's just a little puppy or bunny :D. yay :D. aw, I should let you get to sleep too :P
It's okay, I don't need sleep :P. And I still gotta clean my room
o.o. it's a bunny! :D
aw, I gotta go find 11 hangers :P. wait, freaking out because of me?.  :P. or the noises?. maybe someone snuck a dog into their hotel room?. sneaked*?. wait :P make that 9
aw (: thanks. :P I have to admit, I don't see it though. hmm.. maybe you could just.. listen to some nice music? :P. or would you feel the vibrations? :P
aw :( didja bring the charger? :P . And just what you see :P
(:!!! Aw. That sounds like, exactly how I feel about you. (: . I really really like you too. (:. I want to say that you're my everything, but that just sounds cheesy. :P 
:P aw, I didn't mean for *you* to say it. . (:. It sounds all nice though.
(: I want to say it anyway too :D Maybe I'll just catch you off guard one day.
:P but what about when you're asleep? . lol whoops :P didn't mean for that to sound creepy, but now I'm not too sure.
:P maybe subliminally? 
I always feel like you're doing stuffs in my dreams, like playing bowling, but then I can never remember. :P. I had a really cool/weird dream last night. :P
:P I reallly can't remember.. but If you were bowling, I bet you were really awesome at it :P. ahh, I really really really really really really really like you. (:!!. did the bunny noises stop?
That's good :D lol aw, I'm glad you pet a bunny already. :P They're sooo soft.
(:. :P
It probably is, right?. I think I need to go eat something. :P. I made pudding earlier!
lol you're wayy better than pudding :D!. G'night to you too though :D. Dream of bunnies and pudding and other awesome stuff :D!
aw yay :D. lol :P it's okay, it's nice sounding
I wish I could respond to it with something cornier :P. I really really really really really like you too! :D (:
bread is so multifuctional :P
!! Yeah :D
And when you have bunch of marshmallows in your mouth, that probably sounds a lot like I love you so much :D
G'night, Peter. (:
(: Awww, that sounds even cuter :P. What happens if you try to say, "Di ruffs du row wush?"
maybe it'll be like counter-effective :P
(: You're perfect. dough pefect (:. perfect*
I bread you :P
aw :(. it does?
well it has the best intentions :D. aww :P you're right. Well.. I meant that I love you :D. What does  'I marshmallow you' sound like? :P. !!! It sounds like fluffy goodness :P
:D I'm always saying it in my head. :P. (: . hmm, loud noises are kind of scary when you're alone :P. Hotels are generally safe zones though
same with friends' houses. (:
only old ones :P I don't think I could ever get freaked out in like, a Ramada or something though. o.o. peephole?
aw, how'd that happen?
awwww I'm sorry :( That sounds not the bestest. :P. I got really good at sleeping on hardwood floors :P
were you doing some tossing and turning? ;p. :P*
lol :P I never know how to tell those things. . ooh!!!
I don't think I move too too much, because I'm good at sleeping next to laptops :P. and one time I slept with a textbook on top of me :P
but in hotel couches it's different story? :P. maybe it's cause you're on your guard. for scary bunny noises and people telling you that you're their everything? :P
ohhh. I see :P
!! It's so easy to get lost in churches :P. You make me think of unicorns and bunnies :D. (: and happy stuff
:P I don't know. You said you got lost. And the last time I got lost was in your church :P. :D That's good, because I'm super duper duper glad to have you (: 
:P It's fine. It was kind of funny though. :P I was just saying "Marco" a bunch and talking to no one in particular :P. You're a good guide :D!
:D! Oh yeah, that would've been fun! I think it worked out fine though hopefully.
aw :( But co-ed sardines would've been sketchy anyway :P
nothing to be sorry about :D You're superduperuber cool!
just you is superduperuber cool (: And perfect.
(: where do all the caterpillars keep coming from? :P
:p And then they magically change somewhere along the way?. Whoa, if words were caterpillars.. then they'd get all scrambley. 
yay (: Though I think me understanding how is kind of impossible. :P I can't wait to do fun stuffs with you :P
:P Waiting is fun though, it's like.. . pudding in a giant kiddy pool?. And I guess it's just one of those hard to understand things :P. We better get to sleep or something similar :P
:P lol is that a word?
aw bad wi-fi? :P. (:!
I love you dough much too (:
aw (: I don't think there's anyone else who could make me happier either. And that's alright :P that just made me superduper happier than I already was. Which mean that I'm.. ecstatic? :P lol that word sounds so sarcastic. . :P does the slow internet mean that you won't get what I send either? :P. maybe I should say something revealing :P. Or just goodnight (:
And that I feel superduper lucky and happy and amazed everytime I think of you (which might very possibly be full time) :P . just.. you're amazing (: And sweet dreams.
ohh okay :P. That makes sense ish (:. And you do find lots of clovers :D. Does that still happen? :P
! I bet it does even in huge cities where there's no grass :P
Pigeons just drop them from the sky and they land in your hand :P. Whoa!! that's really cool :D. sounds like.. amazingly lucky :D. but since it's you, it's actually really believable :P
(: It's so believable though. You're soooo perfect (:! 
:P (: funny how things work out like that. (: everything about you is so so so amazing . :P lol sorry. You word things nicely. and sorry for going on about this :P you just really really are perfect (:. I'll let you get to sleep (:. G'night :D
(: Sleep as awesomely as possible on a hotel couch! :D
:D so it's meant for sleeping? :D! lol I sometimes like sleeping on couches because they're all cozy. (: . G'night :D (:
you're wonderful (:
(:. I love you.. If I haven't said it too much already :P
you too (: :D. have an awesome day tomorrow!. sorry for possibly keeping you so long :P
!! whoa, that's so weird :P ish. Coincidental maybe? (:. ooh, wait.. mental jinx? :P. !. :P lol it would only sound creepy if it was anyone other than you :D
yay :D. G'night you. (:
ooh yay :D! I love those :D from you especially! <fist pound back> :D. (: g'night

:P lol It's okay, I wasn't very specific.
!! so, :D unboring day yesterday I hope?
!! like.. go lights? :P. maybe that's another reason to like green circles. lol I said go-lights instead of stop-lights :P. I think I like the former better . aw, boring?. but. but... It's vacation :D
Aw, I really really miss you too :D but it's not long now (: You should enjoy the flyhotellife :P. !! There's always stuff to do in new towns :P
resort means that you don't have to do anything to have fun :P. you can just lay in the sun with um.. some sunscreen and your favorite edition of Calvin and Hobbes :P. ooh! And listen to any random guitar player person who comes by. oh my goodness! :D!!!!. I found really fun stuff!. And I can't wait for tomorrow or the next day to test them out with you :P. Whenever I think of something fun, I always feel like it'd be wayy more fun doing it with you :D
it'd make it like..100x more fun. :D like a super skateboarding combo or something :P
It's hard to explain :P but I'll try one day :P. whoa.. I just realized I was wearing socks! o.o
I know! :P Well like, I had forgotten for a while.
Well it's fun doing fun stuff, but it's even morrreeeee fun doing that fun stuff with you :D!. It's crazy how many times I've wished you were in town. But Massanuttin does sound fun, so I don't mind waiting as much :D
So I could do stuff with you :D!
I was in kroger the other day, and I saw some Little Debbie snacks, and I was wishing you were there :P. There are a bunch of similar incidents too :P. aw, rain isn't any fun.. but hmm... does the swimming pool still operate in the rain? :D!
whoa.. Well.. um.. :P. ooh! is there a wall with windows that you can sit and watch from?. That's always fun!!! :D
aw :(. Hotel room window then? :P
tepes? :D. or um... wigwams?. y'know, for the rian. rain*
It so matters :D you gotta make the most of your last day!!!. Go crazy :p
ooh!!! Take all the kinds of cereal at the breakfast bar, stack it on a bagel using layers of morter-jam, and then dip it in your coffee and eat it :P I love breakfast bars.. hotel breakfast bars*. wait.. not coffee... um.. apple juice!. :D. I love you. (:
awwwww :P That's the best part.. ish. (:
oooh is it one of those time-share cabin thingys?. :P
whoaaa! :P. That's pretty terrific :P. it's tremendous. and tubular
And um.. :P I'm out of 't' adjectives
aw (: You're perfect
:D!! Do you wanna go see the fireflies with me tomorrow?. (:
Yay :D lol fireflies come out at night though. :P
:P as long as it's before 10pm when there are a whole bunch :D. :P There's always more days though. !!!. There are an infinite amount of days. :D. So anything is possible
Me too. :D . whoa, there's a giant beanstalk in my yard, so I gotta go cut it down today before a random giant goose comes down from it and lays eggs everywhere :P
:P does that mean.. golden chickens!. ?!*. ooh! those eggs must be perfect for getting that perfect golden-y crisp on an omellette :P . I totally should :D!!!. Fe-Fi-Fo-Fumming isn't really my scene though. Plus, it's only about 6 feet tall so far. :P. not much climbing space. yet
let it be :D. :P lol I wonder how tall it would get before it fell over. and grew beans
Yeah! Especially if they are garbanzo. :P :P Wait.. do beans really grow on beanstalks?
yay :D that Jack guy knew what he was doing :P
I'd want him at my local grocer :P. y
Whoa, that's scary.. I think I've seen it though. :P. somehow. it was like.. horror-y?
ooh! was the movie called Jack? :P
o.o. I thought that was Benjamin :P. or um... ooh!!. Old School?
:D yeah!
so he was a 40 year old 12 year old.. ish.. :P. lol. I liked the guy who was following the transformer
I'm not sure :P All I remember from the movie is this one foreign looking guy learning the robot by following a toy around :P
yay :D . I want to do that :P
(: . maybe one day. you're so cool! :D. I should go get the hedge clippers (aka durable scissors), and get that weed :P. my neighbor mowed for us today :D. magic beanstalk*
you're cooler than ice :D
yay :D. you have fun too :D
make something :D. there's always something out there :D. make something to do*
:P lol but if you pack, that means that you have to go home. . I hope the same for you :D I hope the rain doesn't come over here!
yay :D but you'll always be able to see me. (:. whereas, you can't always be in Massanuttin :P
You see me a lot. :P. You're superduper amazing :D!
noo, it's so fun! :D!. I love seeing you. :P. lol I still wish you were around to do stuff. :P. I do try to be patient though :D!. I'm gonna do home-improvement stuff today if anything else doesn't come up :P
(: You're the funnest to be around
Okay cool :D Talking to you is part of my stuffs :D I think I'm gonna go eat a sandwich too. And maybe I can try that jam-mortar thing tomorrow--I feel like nothing works as well as marshmallow fluff though :P . (: I hope your last day in Massanuttin is the bestest! :D
aw yay (: And no way. You have no idea how much more fun everything feels with you. (:
I'll give you the idea. :D It's not copyrighted yet so it's totally on-limits. I'm not sure you're right. :P. because fun with you > fun without you :D
:P I'll prove it. :D along with a bunch of other stuffs. :P Like jam-mortar. It'll be all the rage in 'playing with your food developments.'. You're so amazing. (:. And I hope you have fun, too, regardless of how boring the weather and location might be. :D Fun should travel with you.
You're lots of fun! :D You're like a portable slinky! (: or um. Canned sponge cake?
I'm gonna buy one of those one day :P And open it with you. :P . And I'll use a manual can opener, because I still can't get the hang of those new-fangled ones :P
aw (:. I heart you too :P
:D. byebye for now
See you really really really soon. (:  and thanks. (: You're the bestest. I love you thisssss much. (arm gestures) :D. bye :D
:D yay. Aw, sorry you have to leave though. :P It sounds like a fun place. One day, I'm gonna go to Massanuttin and tour the whole native american village :P. Or just go down that cool looking slip and slide.
well, it's vacation, and no one ever really likes leaving nice places. :P 
aw, why not? besides the whole rain and food thingy and 'boringness'? :P and couch thing..
aw. :P well maybe it changes a little every year.. maybe it's an acquired taste :P. You're warm (:
:P You're welcome?
:P Aw yay. Maybe not right now though :P
The air conditioning vent is kind of cold :P. it's by my bed but I tried to cover it up with lots of pillows :P
:P lol it's okay the pill lows mostly work ish.. pillows* :p. Being a pillow must feel really comfy. :D
me too :D I wouldn't want to be one of those memory foam pillows though, they're too heavy :P
:D! I'd want to be a pillow that explodes feathers on impact.
yes :D! And the ultimate pillow fight weapon. :P
:P lol the cold part isn't as bad though, but I hope the vents don't mind being closed :P
ah, I should probably let you get to sleep so you can um. sleep and stuff :D. um, jinx? :P
aw, any reason why not?
makign the most of your last night? :D
aw no :(. It's not the couch is it?. ooh! :D!! I know some good tricks for sore backs :P
yeah :D. awwww :( I hope you're okay
wait.. upper or lower back? . does sleeping on your tummy work? :D
aw :(. I wanna help when I see you :P If it still hurts
I hope so. :D I haven't yet perfected my yoga type back treatment thingy. :P
:P lol not quite. but thanks anyway. :P. (:
:P Depends what the bestest is. Oooh! :D I have ice cubes in my freezer!
:/? :D It's very nice! I wish I had cool shaped ice trays though. 
and okay, but only because I am kind of sleepy and I heard sleep keeps you warm (maybe?) :P
aw, I'll miss you. :D. have a safe trip back and everything . I love car rides :D!
You're so easy to miss though, because having you around is just superduper fun :D
ahh closets are scary.. aw, well that's why I miss you :P
:P I just got up to close the door because it was scarily open and stuff could be creeping in there, but then when I closed one side, the other one swung open and I got scared for a second and ran for the light switch :P
:P ghosties are scary
:P lol well I knoww that. ish. but it was dark and scary.. o.o
! :P what was it?. ooh, bunny noises? :D
Aw.. :P. well then I'll tell you mine later too :P
yes :P
aw, I kind of wanted to hear the story. :P Maybe it'll be another thing to be excited about for tomorrow
it's okay :D . I'm excited :D!. but you're sure it's not about bunnies? :P
aw, well that's okay :P mine is silly too.. And I think that will be decided later when I know all the details. :P It's probably really awesome. :D All your stories are (:

I like you (:
bunches. o.o. not by itself, right?
yay (: but oh no O.O That's so scary!. did you have to turn it off?
But no, don't worry :P I bet it's just air pressure.
.... :P noo. that's too weird. bunnies don't even have thumbs
!!! That totally makes sense! :D. like Bewitched or something :P
aw :D I bet he was making macaroni and just needed some water to boil :P
:D! bunnies are famous for their amazing sharing abilities, so you can expect some soon :P . aw :( . !!!. It sounds bad
:(. I wish I could help
ooh! try whipping your hair back and forth? :P or not.. that could make it hurt more
:D!! That means that you're magic too :D. hmm..
Neck pillow!!! :D
If you're not magic, then you're just really goood at slight of hand.. aw :(. do you have a regular pillow?
does it work behind your neck? :P lol wait, that sounds painful ish.. And I believe you are :D

And Oprah. not until I win that Nobel Peace Price thingyy :P

It's okay, just as long as you don't mind :P
yay (:. how do you make turkey while sleeping?

sorry :P
awww. you will most defnitely get the change. chace*. chance*
ooh, the turkey generator is good for insomnics who are skipping out on sleep in order to eat--with the generator, then they are required to sleep in order to eat not raw turkey. aw, I hope you do :D. there is Monday still though?
yay :D. I want
aw, but I don't want your neck to hurt anymore :(
no :( there's still hope. that sounds so sad. I don't want you to ever hurt. sleep can be anytime

It;s okay :D I'm not missing anything. are you sure you can't sleep though?. maybe some sitting down position? :P lol sleeping in a chair?

Byebye :D!
Whoa, I just had like a scary but cliche dream. It was very easy to wake up from though, so that's good. :P lol  Good luck with your neck/back again (:
:P Maybe it can be sweet and scary at the same time? :P my second one was even more interesting. :D Bye for now and have bunches of fun!. Oh, just in case.. I should probably let you know that my cell phone is a little lost at the moment, so if you want to call for any reason (if that's possible :P), my home phone/landline is um.. 552-1357 (rather odd, right?) :P  Car rides sound fun. (:
When I press 'enter'.. it just spaces me down :P
:D!. ooh yay, it works now. And you don't have to be sorry, you were awesome :D!. And it was awesome seeing you! :P. And I now understand the whole 'jinx' thing. But I still prefer the um... Kim Possible way? :P
:P It's just the whole.. you say 'jinx' when you say the same thing.. and whoever says it first gets a soda :P but if you both say 'jinx' at the same time, then you go into doubles and triples and quadruples to decide the soda ordeal :P
yeah :D!. ah, I'm so so so sorry about your back. I was hoping I would help :P
:P lol thanks for making me sound like I did something beneficial. I'll have to study up on my chiropractic techniques before I try again :P
my room floor is covered in blankets :P
yeah :D  aw, I don't think it was quite long enough, even though it was bunches of fun :D!. I feel like that a bunch whenever I say 'bye' to you. ooh! I drove home! :D
yeah :D!. And I only stalled once! :P
aw okay :P
lol. of course :d!. :D*. I feel like I should practice tumbling or something while all the blankets are here :P
I won't :P Somersaults aren't known to cause serious injury.
lol, that's what they all say, right?
right before it gets them :P
:P I'll wear my non-existent helmet and everything! :D
aw, it's okay, like you said, there's always tomorrow :D!. and me too, but I'm so glad it was something :D . you're so fun and I'm still all smiley (:
I'm sorry for the hug though :P
all of them? :P but mostly the one that I probably made too long
and the one where I hurt your back :P
:P aw really?. It's okay though, I think :P
aw, I know. :P I'm mostly scared that I'll hug you way too much or something.. And I shouldn't get all obsessed hopefully
:P that's good. lol *seem*
I do really like being with you though :D!. something else? oh no.. What could that else be?
don't be sorry, you were absolutely perfect (:
aw, well it's a vacation, and it'd be cool if you were off having fun somewhere :D!. lol I actually was really super excited when I answered the door. :P I kind of wanted to hug you a lot.. I liked your boomerang :D!
care less about you having been gone? 
aw, well it was so so awesome seeing you again! :D I just wanted to act regular and make it not a big deal.. lol :P just a normal Peter sighting
:P I'm sorry.
aw, well I definitely didn't feel regular. :P . I was so jittery and stuff
When I'm with you I kind of want it to be like friends so it doesn't get all messed up and stuff, but maybe sometimes I over-do it? :P . lol I really did want to run up and hug you though. :P maybe if Twe and Madison weren't around..
aw, I don't know how it would be if I acted any other way though. I feel like I would be like, holding your hand and attacking you way more often, and that might not necessarily be a good thing. :P. I wish I could make you feel un-average elsewise though.
aw, did you really feel like just another friend though? I felt like I was spending way more time with you. :P. I missed you a whole lot. thissss much :P. *arms out*
you're perfect, trust me :D!
I wish I could like, act differently or something.. I don't know how though :/. hmm
I'm glad you still trust me after basicallly stabbing you in the back and all :P
it didn't hurt toooo tooo much i hope? :P 
stabbing as in hurting? :P i thought that wording fit the 'trust' thingy better. aw. I need to work on that. :P. ah, I'll let you get to sleep so you can not be sleepy. :D
aw, never mind about what? :P oh no, am I missing out on important things again/. ?*
close physically? :P
aw, really? :/ 
I talk to you and stuff though, right? :D
You're so fun :D. hmm, what does emotionally close mean? :P
aw.. It's bad though, because I don't exactly know the difference still. :P I know that I definitely feel different with you than with other people though.. Ooh! You're my bestfriend too :D (:
oh yeah, I need to let you get to sleep :P
lol :P where did the plague come from? You seem pretty unplague-y.
ohhh :P nice creativity.. You can be the next Van Gough.. just not.. because you seem like you like your hearing :D
I'm really really sorry, too.  But aw.. I feel exactly the opposite though. You're soooooo perfect. Just know that I wouldn't want you to be any other way. You're the bestest. (:. What do you feel like you're doing wrong? :/
:P
song :D!. lol :P I was just about to say... but aw, I don't think you're doing anything wrong at all. It could just be me. :/
no way, you're the perfect one! :D 
:P Touche? 
(: :D! You're the funnest, too and I hope we can do more stuff this summer. :P Maybe our fun will finally work out!. run *. sorry :P at least they rhyme
ooh! :D. I still need to tell you that stuffs that I said I would. :P
:P Oh whoops, maybe i should've let you :P
no :P I'm not sure if I'd be able to say it all at once though.
I guess not :P I can be spread out a bunch maybe.. You won't even know when I do say it. :P. It could be a n y t h i ng. :P. anything*
Don't worry :P! It's definitely not bad.. I think Sarah Price's shopping list sounds really cool. :P
please don't :P
probably for the best.. paper shredder. :P. Those are so fun to use :D!. well, I've never--but they look fun! :D. aw, you don't seem like a worrier. :P
ooh! :D paper shredder with a dinosaur mouth?

I just wanna go and do everything with you because it'd make it sooo much more fun! :D. lol that's okay, maybe you won't remember all this if you aren't. I'll let you get to that (: ; I should too

:P no way, don't be sorry. . lol sorry, it looked like you were typing, so I was waiting to reply.. It seems like there are some dartboard drinking games. but I play though using candy. :P 
of course :D!!
like I said, it's fine. :P . whatever it is. did you know they make *extreme* sour patch kids? :P
It sounds sooo extreme! :P. aw, what exactly is it? :P 
I'd probably disagree :P
stuffs? :P that might need more elaboration
you being gone is a big deal :P especially for a whole week. Aw :/ I wish I knew how to make you feel otherwise.
It sounds really really important actually. :/
but like.. I don't want you be not happy or worried about anything. (cliche sounding? :P)
:P To be honest, it does sound awfully important
Or I can help somehow possibly? :P
I should know, and you shouldn't need to either.. worrying is um.. bad for your soul :P. You're never a waste of time
noo, you're definitely definitely not! Whoa, I feel like that sometimes. :P Does it feel different in your mouth?. Have you been eating popcorn or peanut brittle recently? :P
:P lol that sounds kind of scary.. better for eating hard stuff though? Like um.. bricks? :P. And you're still definitely not. :P
you could be indoctrinated into the people-with-sharp-teeth club :D! And you're still not :P
:P Folding blankets is possible if you're only one person, right? :P
:P lol I'm fine, That sounds like such a hassle.  "Hey, come help me fold blankets please. :P"
:P lol would you really like to? 
yay :D wreck from the morning?
That word could never fit with you :P . awwww.. Sorry again bout the back. :P
:P nah. . but you are pretty amazing :D!. like grace :P
amazing is the best fit I could find. If not perfect :D!. Aw, I wish I could just go do something with you right now--I was sort of waiting on an email from someone about a bike though :P
:P but definitely not more important. hold on, my dad called
okay :D I'm back :P . or something like that :P
oh, I just added that on as a filler mainly :P. hmm, anything you'd really want to do today?. maybe some trapeeze-ing? :P
!!! yay :D and the trapeze bar swinging too :P 
it looks so fun, but I don't think they have anything like that near blacksburg :P
yeah, same with the indoor skydiving :P
yeah :P That's one of the pluses to living in a large city I suppose
:P!! You're really not, and I wish I had some kind of portable e-mail. :P Are you free like.. at the moment? :P
Nah, it's probably a lost cause by now :P. Shall we meet at squires?. I could give you a ride there
*if you're free of course. lol so :P walking is hard.
alright neat :D let me know
yay :D. sorry for the late timing :P
neato :D hmm, maybe I have some lying around :P. I definitely have purple poster paint
:P alright cool :D. Do you need it for anything in particular? :P. Doing some legal graffiti?
That's awesome :D And okay, take your time :P
oh yeah, it's fine :D! didja find the spray paint?
They do have a whole lot of spraypaint there :P. lol I went yesterday, I should've picked some up for you :P
psh, my sixth sense should've kicked in :P
I do :d!. anything you would be interested in?
yay :D How does the squires thingy sound?
neato :D I'll ask my mom if it's okay
okay :D I can
yeah :P
at squires? :P
squires sounds good :D. I can be there at 6 :D
yay :D bye
aw, you feel silly? :P You're so so so so awesome! And darts were superduper fun. :P lol Who knew throwing sharp objects could be so captivating? 
I said 'what?"?
aw, I did? :P I'm sorry.. I didn't mean it in a bad way
I'm not sure. :P I don't even remember saying it, so I'm sure it was just like.. hmm.. :P like, I didn't know what else to say or something
It's okay. (: It was kind of nice. I'm sorry for hugging back? :P
ohhhh, I think I remember that. I'm sorry, though. I wasn't sure what you were doing. Like, if you wanted to hug me or not. :P . sorry for confusing you :(
:P Good question. um. reach for something behind me? :P
:P yeah.
I'm sorry, too. :/ I'm probably still bad with the whole hugging thing.
Oh no, I'm sorry. :P I don't want you to be confused.
How do you mean?
I'm sorry for my contribution to the confusion anyway. :P
oh. hmm. I'm kind of curious about what they said now. :P  Do you mind me asking; maybe I can misprove it?. disprove*
Oh.. aw, I'm sorry :P. Is it about like.. hugging or something? :P
:P no, I'm clueless.
everything.. being? :P . but that's not good.. you should be yourself and stuff.
I love everything about you. (:. Oh.. Aw.
bad stuff is scary.. Aw, I feel bad though, because I'm not good for that stuff. :/
Well what's your opinion?. (:. :P
I think that I probably should hold your hand and hug you since I'm your girlfriend, but hopefully since I'm not the bestest with those things, that maybe there's other stuff a girlfriend can do? :/ I just don't want you to feel like there's something missing.. or something like that.. Your turn? :P
aw (: I like your opinion. I hope it's true though. :P I wouldn't consider myself so special. But maybe having you is good proof? :P  lol :P "assertive" how?
(: And you're amazing. . aw :P I'm not sure if I'd deserve that title
Yay. (: . (: Today was amazing.. I do wish you could've come over though--only if you would've wanted, of course. :P
Yeah! :D It had a promising beginning. They fit six cute animals into it in only the first 10 minutes. :P
o.o
lol right of passage to what? :P. relationships?
oh. Aw.. :/
but still, it sounds pretty convincing. :P
about.. being a teenager? :P
aw :/
oh. Like.. about me not wanting to hug possibly?
aw :(
I'm sorry, I was mainly just surprised. :P. And I kind of just a little might be bad at hugging in general and mostly in public.. I don't know. :/. I'm sorry.
aw, well a hug like that doesn't mean anything.
but when I'm hugging you it feels awkward in public because it's like a really special moment.. I don't know :/ It doesn't make sense, does it?
Something like that. :/. I'm really sorry.
:P lol I wish I were talking to you in person.
yay :D. That would be bunches of fun.
Definitely. :P Like, I can't tell what tone anything is in.. I felt like you were really upset or something, but I can't tell. :/
Okay, that's good. (: And it's fine, it's just misinterpretation I suppose. :P
I guess when you said the 'hug a stranger' bit. I got kind of sad. :( . Aw, I wish I could explain stuff better.. I'm thinking that I feel superduper terrible for like.. ... :/. I don't know.
:P lol 'no problem' meaning I was reluctant at first and then only gave him what was once politically incorrectly coined a "popular girl hug" :P. sorry, that's my point of view. :P. aw, I wish I was better at hugging you.
aw :( I guess it would've been different if you'd seen more.. hopefully.
fireworks?
sorry, random. :P just wondering if you heard 'em.. But I can assure you, hugs to other people really don't mean anything. They're more like, formal obligations. Like, something people tend to expect, so it's hard to get out of them.. :P people never understand when I say that I just don't hug
hmm, do you think British people hug?
:P Because I've heard that they do not.. hmm.. 
Maybe, when someone wants a hug, I can tell them that I'm trying to be more British. :P
:P Whoa. . lol I wouldn't use it on you. :P
Oh yeah, it was a pretty awesome excuse, right?
like, with me? :/. Or in general? :P. lol. I never know how to act.
oh :/ Aw, well honestly I just want to be with you and play games (like darts? :D), and go on adventures, and do all kinds of fun stuff. :D
yay :D. ooh! I hope I get to see you soon. :D
(: Aw, butterflies are nice. . :P lol caterpillars make lots of circular holes in paper fruit though.
oh no! :P That was my fault.. Caterpillars aren't carnivores.
:P However did that happen? . I'm sorry :P
:P lol wow, thanks for making me feel a lot better about it. But still, I should make it up to you. :P 
Maybe I could go on a 'don't-hurt-Peter-for-a-week" trial. :P oh yeah, it was yesterday.
I'll start now? :P I'm really really sorry.. The first time was probably more preventable.
:P lol any time that I do will be completely accidental, but I should try and take some preventive measures. :P
:P lol thanks for that. :P That still stands though.. maybe i should've added "on porpoise" to the end of that.. purpose*
Aw, I really really really would never ever ever do that.. That'd be the worst, and I hope my repeated word usage emphasized that :P
(: That good, I trust you too. (: Aw, I hope I don't ever let you down, though. 
I'm not sure, I'd never ever want to though, and I'd try my hardest not to. :D
(: You're so perfect. 
:D ! There's definitely a way. And after knowing you for awhile, I can safely say that you're perfect. (:
ah, should I let you get some sleep? :P I probably haven't been taking time into consideration.
:P That's exactly what happened to me! :P
:P You're so awesome! And I say that you woould've won at darts if we were playing for bullseye closeness :P
:P I feel like you could've skillfully gotten a bullseye
:P Well, It still looked pretty impressive. lol the elusive five. hmm, depends if there is more than one moment of confusion. :P
oh. :P hmm. I'd say to be unaffected by outside opinions, but sometimes advice is nice.. they even rhyme :P. maybe, with so many different ideas, it means that there's not really one right answer? :P
:P
speaking of ferris wheels...
:P maybe it matched your description. And it's just a good um.. non-sequitur? 
:P um.... aw, this is one of the things I was wishing to talk to you in person about. :P. I'm not sure.. . hmm.. Are you interested in attending the Salem Fair? :P
:D. Oh cool.. :P
yeah :D! . lol :P And maybe when I'm less sleepy.
Probably later. :D but maybe not soon.. How about yourself? :P
:P oh yeah, maybe just a little sleepy.. lol, there is always tomorrow, right?
How is the confusion? :/
:P lol. That sounds good.
is it like.. still around?
being a guest?. aw :(. I really wish I could be of help.
:P lol ohh okay. The 'that's good' comment still stands then. :P sorry, I take my frowny smileys quite seriously.
o.o
lol that's scary sounding. :P
lol :P What was the other thing?
:P um. the other idea?. tehe :P is it mine?
Whoa! rain!. :P. lol I can hear it.
o.o of rain?
Whoa, like.. a cat possibly? :P . Or a ghostie?
aw, I don't want to like sway your opinion or anything.
o.o! as long as they're wearing plaid, it'll be alright. :P
ooh, lumberjacks do, in fact, wear plaid! :D they could be an accidental axe murderer.  Aw, that's how I feel about kissing a little. :P . kissing, a little*. commas mean everything. :P
hmm, you like cheerios, right? :P
:P nothing really, just random. I guess not many people don't like cheerios though. :P. Oh no, lightning too :D
:P lol ewwy.
That sounds kind of gross. :P. it's okay.
:P. ewwyy
aw, like saying 'I love you" too much?. I'm not sure about that one though.
:P I think it's possible to mean it everytime :D
o.o :P lol aw. you sound all nice and everything.. like, that's how I feel too.. :P I wonder why thunderstorms tend to happen at night
yeah, definitely. :P
I think that may be also why I'm so bad with hugging. :P. and yes. 'nice and everything" meaning 'perfect.' (:
thunder! :D. I hope it does. I still feel really bad for it though. :/ 
:/ I guess I do kind of feel like you'd be happier if I did do more 'girlfriend' stuff. Like kissing. Or at least just holding your hand? Like, I feel like I'm making you miss out. :/ 
Well, I don't know, I'd just want you to be not confused and happier and not feeling like you're just a friend. :/ That's for being supportive though. You always make me superduper happy. (: 
but what if I really am doing things wrong? :P
wait, really? :/ aw I wouldn't want that though. 
You should be you. And I like you. (:
Okay, I hope so. (: I don't think there was ever anything to 'fix' anyway.. you're perfect already (:. And thanks. (: That means a bunch. 
:J I really really care about you too. . And you being happy makes me the happiest. :P
:D yay, chain happiness. :P And it's okay, you never do.. whoa, the time keeps changing. :P. We should definitely get to sleep. :D
the times they are a'changin'?. yeah. :P lol I've already said silly things
:P It sounds like quite the line.
aw :/. :P lol any chance you'd take me up on that 'just friends' offer?
positive? :P
I want you. But.. hmm.. What was the silliest thing you could say? :P
:P I think I did already.. you can respectfully decline though.. Maybe it's best unheard?
lol marriage isn't creepy.
:P lol okay, maybe that is creepy. . :P. but.... not like.. creeper creepy. :P. it's a cool creepy.
:P I'm actually not that 'creeped out,' but I thought that could be even 'creepier.' :P
me saying that I'm not creeped out? :P
lol well fine then. :P I'll have'ta keep thinking on it.. ah, it's all late. :P. We should sleep.
I set my alarm for 7 am, but I feel like I might change that now :p. It's okay. I like stuff :D. lol maybe it should be discussed in person though.
the keyword is um.. unicorn.. wait. :P I use that in everyday speech too often, it could get confusing.. hmm, dragonfruit?
I'm not even sure. :P. keywords are just nice.
:P I don't know what I'm saying anymore. yay (:. You're so cool.
:P well I still say you're as cool as one big block of ice. Which is very cool.. You're a great big glacier and not even global warming can melt you. :P
you're so cool, that you can be both? :P. :D. lol you're so cool, that you contradict yourself.
Like that cool starburst.
(:
You're perfect. (:. I think I'm gonna get to sleep before I go all narcoleptic. :P
napattacks come without warning :P
It's fine. :D I hope talking helped a little. lol I still want to in person too so I can tell what you mean more.. :D Sweet caramel dreams.
:D!!! aww . beat me to it. :P. I l<3ove you too :D. l <3 ove. oh wait..
I l <3 ve you. okay :P. yay :D. hearts.. (:. I feel all l <3 ved.. lheartve. G'night Peter :P. Thanks for darts *yesterday
:P!!!!!! It was totally an accident! :P. lol dart rhymes with heart.. :D
you make me super duper happy (:. :P. ouch.. sounds painful.
:P lol cute. . hearts do look really sharp though o.o. <3
:D I love yours too. (: It's the bestest and super nice and warm and cool. :P
(: aw. Are you at that point where you're sleepy and saying silly things? :P
(: awwwww.. That kind of gave me a bunch of butterflies. :P. I love you too. (: And I lheartve you as well. :P. Sleep well (:
:P lol whoa, me and em are very different :P. I hope your dreams are really awesome! :D
like, maybe a giant marshmallow bouncy house (that's also bug proof) :P. aw (:
:P It's crazy that you think that. You're really cool though. :P. Nice talking to you and good night. (:
(: Thanks. I'll never be able to believe how lucky I am. You're the bestest, Peter. (:  lol G'night or morning to you too.. byebye (:
:D songs are nice. :P lol Mine needs a beat I think. . I doubt it's silly. :D. do you start with lyrics or music first? :P
Awesome :D mine is in it's very early stages, but I hope it'll be a hit. :P
Aw, but that's the best time to share song lyrics :P. lol 
:P aw, okay. . but maybe some other time? :P
yay :D. G'night, Peter!. Have an awesome day in whatever you do. :D
(: the word looks quite unstable. :P. aw (: You're good at being there.. I like you. (;. (: *
yay. :D sorry for my accidental winking smiley :P
lol That's good. :P . Sometimes my shift button fails me at bad times :P
(: I don't think you ever could even if you tried. :P. like.. ever could fail me.. You're really awesome (:
 :D Wish I truly was. :P lol I see lots of colors when I close my eyes.. Oh yeah, g'night :D
You're truly perfect (:
:P lol
combinations and permutations? :P. lol sorry, math greatly affected my life today :P. Anywho, g'night :D
I know! :P It's insane
you're so good at adding :P. nightnight :D
:P it's okay, rhymes are sublime? :P 
Wish this could be in person, but know that i love you so so much. (: Sleep well.. Bye.
That's good to know. (: Ttfn :D
Ooh, I hope you are too :D!!! the weather is nice. :D. :P
Oh thanks :P My other one was super out-dated. I like yours! :D Aw :(. What happened to your day?. I think it can still get better! :D
:D Nope, still here. :P
Aw, well I'd hate for that to happen :P
Oh no :(. I feel like I'd be partly to blame for that.. Actually, fully to blame possibly. :P. Didja do some fun morning activities? 
Whoa.. !!!!!!!!!. :D! Did I tell you about the lawnwork I did? 
brb sorry, my dad called
Okay :D sorry. but yeah :D!! I got to use an edger thingy and it was so so so cool. :D lol I might've possibly told you this before.
It's fine. :P. lol you should just get one of those to mow the lawn and it'll make it a bunch of fun. :D! . it might not be as efficient though..
Aw, you're right. but still. :D If it's more fun, then it might not feel like work. :P
yay :D I hope I'm not to something. . on*. lol those words sound similar. My day was okay, kind of average besides holding a tiny little bunny :D
oh :P I'm not sure what average even means, but I feel like it could describe it.. I went to Olive Garden and had some unlimited breadsticks :P!
:P Oh yeah, totally.
Well, I mean.. It couldn't compare to other stuffs. :P. It was pretty fun though, I guess. :D. And the storm was kind of awesome. :D
:P Well I was hoping a little to do something with you, but I guess I didn't get home early enough.. Maybe if the weather's really nice tomorrow.. How was mowing? :D. and the rest of your day?
O.o aw :(. Why would they be upset at you?. You're really cool.. And I'm pretty sure that you're good at mowing lawns :D. :( . stick?
oh no :( that's scary.. How can you mow a lawn wrong? :P I always thought the grass just had to be shorter.
Grass can suffocate? o.o
oh.. Aw :(. I'm sorry that happened.. I feel like they shouldn't've minded too much.. Unless they were having their in-laws over that weekend :P
ohhh. :P I see. . Well that makes more sense then, because people you don't know well would probably be okay with it. :P. but aw :( I'm still sorry.. At least you learned stuff?. I can't imagine your dad being upset. o.o. He seems so nice.
Aw :( Maybe he was just having a bad day?. You shouldn't think to much of it
It wasn't your fault. I make mistakes all the time. :P. I'm pretty used to people getting upset at me.
noo that's not true at all. You're like, the best thing ever! :D And you really should think too much of the yelling.. And you're not wasting my time at all. (:. You're improving my time. :P
aw. :( I'd like to take a walk with you.. If only my mom would let me. I'd have to stay within a 500 foot range or something :P. sorry, maybe you meant an alone walk?. so..?. so perfect? :D
aw :(. you shouldn't.. I think you're worth so so much. I feel like you're one of those special people out there who could change the world or something. :D. Just make everyone's lives so much better just by being around :D. That's you. (:
Well there's just something about you that makes you just different from everyone else. :D like one of those diamond in the rust thingys.. the space difference? :P And lateness?
a dime a million :D!. You're already making it a bunch better though! :P. ooh, are you doing anything tomorrow?
does that mean that you're like.. one in a million? :D . like finding a dime in a million acre field :D
Does that mean that you're free? :D. o.o That's slavery.
I don't have much money :( But I'd say you're priceless :D. Like a mastercard commercial.
nope, it's fact
oh aw...!!! I still need to see you in person :D!. And you've never ruined anything. :D You just make it better
Well, I don't think so. :D I'll have to convince you. :D
Aw, bye?. Going on that walk?
oh nos, I think that might've just been a glitch hopefully. :P. Sometimes I accidentally x out of the page
aw :(
:/ just because of the mowing incident?
aw :/ . well.. did you eat cereal?
Then it can't have been that bad. :P. Quick, go pet a puppy to make it even better! :P
http://bunnyherolabs.com/adopt/customize.php?mc=dogbebo.swf. here you go :D
aw :( Well I hope the walk helps at least.. I'll be sure to be here when you return. :D!. (:
You're the coolest, Peter. (:
lol :P don't get eaten by those scary gremlin thingys
:D you can if you want. :P. Like I said, I'll be here :D!. noo, gremlins are nice until you take them swimming. :P
:P worry?. ooh, and get them wet :D. I think?. and something else too.. :D!!! ooh 
:( aw.. You're leaving?
It's fine, you should probably get some sleep anyway. :P I'm so so sorry i sleep deprived you.
oh yeah :D! that's why nighttime and movie theatres are the most dangerous
ohh okay.. :D Have fun though.. bring a flashlight. :D
sometimes a freak myself out in the dark by thinking I'm seeing scary stuff. :P
:( don't die please
I'll be here unless I doze off :P
I was wondering if you wanted to meet up tomorrow?. oh, well, I'll make sure you don't :P. somehow
I'll just throw a bunch of gold stars your way!
like, as in invincible
I'll worry anyway :P Until you're back safe :D there are some scary things out there.. You're so aweosme! :D. sorry. Have a fun walk :D
:D!! yay! Hi. ooh, did you? :D . are you here right now? :D
Me too :D
Aw :( I know, I checked. aw, you did? :D!!. You should've told me
awww :9. :(*
lol nooo, I wouldn't ask that of you.. Seeing you tomorrow would be much better :D. And it would last longer too :D
aw.
There is always tomorrow :D. I feel like that with some stuff too.
:D!!! You had an epiphany? :D
That's kind of cool :D. aw, I kind of really want to see you too then. :D. would a phone do it justice?
Aw.... :P Now I'm really really really curious.
I definitely wouldn't :D Should I ask my mom first though?. :P
:P not if it's for something important. lol maybe you need to borrow a cup of sugar?
aw, well make sure you write it down just in case it's forgotten, that happened to me kind of last week :/ but I'm sure I can remember with some thought :D
:P It's fine, I remember parts of it
I wish I had an excuse so my mom would be guarenteed to say yes :P. like maybe you left something important here?. like.. hmm.. a hat? :P. I'm not sure.
:D. lol me hat. nah, my mom would see through it, I'll just ask her.. brb
she said you can :D. I'm still not positive it'd be worth it to walk alll the way out here though :P
aw, okay :P just ring the doorbell.. I wish I had something for you. maybe a beverage? :P
Okay cool :D
G'night :P lol I'm not sure if it works. Thanks for coming over (:. It really made my day :P

Nah :P I've got time to waste :D And talking to you is actually fun.
:P! I love the sushi cat you made :P
ooh, Leyla's all in New York at a cool school with Canadian dormbuddies! :P
I know! :D I think the studies are really really difficult though. lol they're called.. "intensive studies." She drew from a live model!
:P It does sound exciting and all. . I've drawn you before...! but somehow, I don't think it's quite the same.. Ah, I better get to that eating thing. I think my tummy would enjoy that too. :P
Oh, because I wanted to say goodnight properly and keep talking to you for awhile. :P

What are you up to? :D
oh no, what about? Don't worry, Sushi cat's arm is still hanging on. :P lol
yay :D . lol, something tells me that might not be all you're worried about?
Well, if I can help, I'd like to somehow. :D. It's never normally silly things :D
Well, like.. maybe the stuff to be worried about is silly, but it's not silly if it's worrying you? Yes, that somehow made sense possibly. :P
shoe boxes are pretty big.... :P. especially if you're like.. Michael Jordan or something.. sorry :P Kidding.. but getting tired of you sounds impossible :D
Oooh, and boot shoeboxes are reallyyy big! sorry again. :P but aw :P That's not too silly. I keep stuff like that too, I just wish I was that organized. :P I use a drawer. 
nooo... songs are lies :P. lol :P I like that one. with the dino.
I thought that was a love song :P Or just had a catchy tune.. hmm.
:P I'd say mainly your fun-ness and easy to talk to-ness. :D . but then, past all the stuff I liked about you in the 'first place,' I found out that everything you do is pretty perfect and I like just about everything. (:  . It's crazy, and I might be quoting someone here, but you have this really strong sense of right and wrong. And I think that's one of the things that I really really like.  Like, not everyone is like that, y'know? 
:P That sounds good. lol that phrasing sounds like you have good teeth or something though. :P
It is, right? :D You seem especially good at it though. :P 
o.o Starbucks frappachinos have a life span of 5 hours.
Doesn't that make it better? :D It's like Dr. House or something.. And yeah! :D there's been one half-finished one in my room for 3 days and I'm starting to think that I should get rid of it. :P. It's like.. weird colors.. It's a um.. suspension now. :P. yay chemistry
o.o! lol :P. fo show.. There's like, a whole lot of cream in those things. :P
really? :D! I feel like there's still way more to know though. :P
yay for adventure! :D And that's so crazy. :P. I kinda feel like that about you sometimes. :D
:P I'm a mystery? I thought you were playing that role pretty well. :P Or maybe you did mean yourself?
:P lol Whoa, so so far you only know who all the characters are?
yay :D. Sounds fun. o.o I did that with the book "Dear John" last year because I wanted to see the movie. :P But now I've forgotten most of the characters and only remember his poker-story.. oooh!! His name is John! :D the title helps me remember
ooh, did you use the dental terminology?. good molars :P. too bad I'm missing four :(. :P
lucky :P. I know a girl who had to get eight out. :P So I'm not complaining
o.o!. I'm too foolish for wisdom teeth :P. I think my sister still has her's :P
or un-lucky because they could take over :P. Whoa!!!!!!!!!!. !! :D. Selena Gomez is featured in a version of this song that I like! :P. lol And there's one lyric that I didn't even pick up in the original
I know!! :P. lol I"m not sure if it's that style of song that you're not all that into though. :P. :P
Sure :P Hopefully you have heard it before though, because it's a pretty good car song. :P. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbD6480kBYE
!!! crazy :D!! This is the only song that I really really like by them so far that I know of. They sound cool though. :D

:P nah.. I'm not sure if you'll think this is as funny as I do..
because you're awesome!! :D
lol nooo :P not thattt!
you really are awesome :D
oh :P It's kind of silly.. um.. I was looking up the lyrics to that song.. and well.. hmm.. Check out the first 5 or so comments. :P http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858711603/. Again, I could be really alone on the funny aspect. :P
:P lol okay.. let's leave it at that. :P. :D yay for sunny days?
Aw :( Well It's a blue sky and whatnot? :D
lol It's silly how funny I still think this is :P
:P lol. He doesn't say that in the song does he?

ah okay :P lol I'll try to find a saw thingy somewhere maybe
:P I do have a normal saw. It's just that key hanger for a late father's day present. :P lol maybe you could help me out. :P Aw, you're still worried?

aw, because you pretend?  sad songs are sad :(
only if they don't get you down. oh :P whoops, thought you meant the songs. and nah, pretend happy doesn't mean anything especially not to yourself. teehee :P hows this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3F0aiJYYg&feature=related
sorry :P
or something sadder? :( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDnw2-TEkUw&feature=related. :P lol I'm not even sure.

whoa, really?
I'm scared for the sad ones then :P. nah, it's fine. they sound like good lyrics
:/ aw, why do ya feel down?
:P but you "might know why?" :D
I didn't think it was bad :P

I'm not sure. You seem a little sad :(
:/ hmm. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6T8mByII8&feature=related lol fireflies :D!. sorry :P silly :P
:D yay for effort.. trying doesn't mean too much though :P
(:. how can I not? :P
You being happy is everything though :D
:D!. I'd say so :D
:P aw, you saw me so soon though. I guess I can understand a tiny bit though, since I miss doing stuff with you :P
lol i really just gotta do some stuff before tomorrow when I wake up at 7am(!) to go play tennis. :P
!! Why would they throw a raquet?. And sorry.. my computer randomly died :P
oh whoops :P I have bad spelling
and you didn't fail I don't think.. It was weird, the screen just went black!. And that doesn't sound very cool :( did it slip? did they have lots of buttered toast right before hand? or um.. butterfingers? :P
:( Are you *that* good at tennis? lol I'm not sure if I should play with you.. And what's wrong? :/ bad tennis memories?
aw :/ well you seem aright, with no checker marks on your face :P but I'm sorry for that. And you're definitely not terrible :P
I don't think you are :D!
:P like a cars, right? :D. wait.. like cars*. :P. you're still not terrible :D
:/. lol :P folding blankets, right? :d. :D*
:P I'll tell you how it goes
Okay :P finished. Status report: most were already folded in half, making the job a little easier; however, I did create quite a breeze trying to get all of them to be perfect rectangles (I failed :P). The floor looks roomier, but there is no longer any cushion to it, and there is a 3 foot tall stack of blankets in the corner once again. :P
definitely :P. lol that was a nice 10 minutes of blanket-folding-fun. ^_^
:42:. o.o! it's the answer to everything
:P me too.. the number to.. life.
oh.. :P aw.
It does :D. the universal response
ohh :P lol it could be. I'll never know what the author was thinking :P. Adams something. We should play tennis :D!
I promise I won't throw anything at you. :P. oh neat :D two first names ish
:P not exactly.. Doing stuff with you always seems to be the funnest. :P
:P different people makes for a different game :D!
:D It's okay, I'm terrrrible!. :P. so maybe we'll be equal?
with you being better :P. aww, this is a cute song :P
the guy sounds kind of like the "Trouble" NeverShoutNever guy.. lol :P We'll see
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoBEuwq2VQk&feature=related :P If you feel like watching something funny
lyrics made of pickup lines :P
aw :D!!. songs are cool :D. lol :P What was it about?
bunnies that take your money?. lol :D awesome!. I just heard about him :P
You're cool :D
only a lot, right? :D
Or yes? :P
:D lol that 'enter' instead of apostrophe thing happens to me a lot :P
your pinky? :P
lol :P. one day they'll make an 'enter guard' so that people don't accidently hit it :P
lol :P I guess it could just get in the way. Sounds nice though.. like a slurpee machine :D
oh man :P lol speaking of accidentally hitting enter.
yes :P It didn't mess too much up though :P
yeah :D
aw, is that a um.. :/ smiley?
okay good :P
me, busy? :P. lol I guess I just still have to make that key-hanger thing... hmm.. :P
:P lol You're so many people :P. :D
:P I meant like,I'm only reallly  talking to you
:P like watch people dress up as snails and cross a road?. totally
:P no way.. You're more legit :P. I'd pick you over Mountain Dew. :P. sorry, just to rhyme :P
:P or a lot above.
We're arguing?! O.O! oh no, it's not real arguing is it?. You win! . :P
Agree that arguing is bad? yes :P
yay :D. smores are reallyyy good :D
But you're all positive :D!! . And awesome :D
lol :P!! That's a cool though. Is it a smore if you eat them all seprately though? :P it'd be like, a tummy smore.. aw :(. Well I wish you good luck in feeling awesome! :D
oh no, you're right, it does! O.o
:D!. only because i have to wake up crazy early :P. I'm gonna go into like a sleeping-in withdrawal!. :P
aw, bye! I'll miss you! but thanks!
:P my excuse is that I reallly really like you :D!
aw :P sorry.
aw :( wait!! what do you feel like?. I can stay a little longer?
nopes, :D I'd like to know :P
aw :/ that's not good.
Is there like, a reason?
it's fine, I can stay a little longer :D
okay, well.. if you still feel the same later, maybe I can help? What is the feeling like? or :/ I dunno.. I just hope you're alright :D. And not wither away or disappering. disappearing*
oh, well okay. but stiil :D!!
(: I think I always will. :D I like you too :D!!. G'night :=you :d. :D*. okay, I do not remember pressing the equal button :P. or that colon in the middle.. Here, I'll just redo the whole thing :P . G'night you :D 
aw..!!! you are feeling down? :P. lol sorry.. I like your smile though (:
:P not open to inquiries?. g'night though, let me know if anything's wrong (:
ah, well okay.. hmm, mystery then? :P
:P Wait, you know how the mystery ends?. Who's the bad guy? :P
aw :(. I doubt that :P
It's just, impossible. You'd be the good guy in the storyline :D or the one who survives getting eaten by the even velosirooster! 
I'd say you do (:
Why wouldn't you think so? and it's fine :D
That's a terrible reason :P sorry to say :P
I'd say you deserve better, but I'm always gonna feel that way.
:J thanks (: That's nice of you though.
It means a whole lot (:. Sushi cat is comfy :D. I should get to sleep soon :P
:P It's fine, no cat is truly symmetrical :P
you do everything right, silly.. lol! :P. "One day, they're going to stop babies from being born, because it'll be too dangerous to live!" :P
And funny :P
maybe just out of context :P
sorry bout that. And you do a whole lot of things right :D
si si :D case closed
:P like I said earlier.... :P sorry, I shouldn't say it again. :P but yeah.
okay (: G'night you.. :P lol no random appearances from equal signs or colons :P
=:. there they are :P. but I'll see you soon :D
sweet caramel dreams to you :D
no missing is necessary.. :D. byebye
:P you shouldn't though :D bye!!
(: . I'm like, less than a mile away.
(: lol that sounds nice :D
G'night (:
okay, that's good :D!! I was wondering. Night.
It's always a good time :P. you have fun too :D!
:D!! Now please? :D
Aw, well okay then :D maybe on the fourth :P. :D I'll see ya around Peter. G'night :D
nooo, no holes :D especially not the one they shoot fireworks out of :P. Bye! lol I'll see how my tennis is tomorrow :P
Oh yeah, you too definitely!! :D
Bye (:
oh, no. Never ever. :P. See ya :D
Psst...
lol it's very fine :P. sorry to catch you at a bad time. :P
oh no!! o.o!! Are you alright? Can you see and walk?!
Care to share what happened?  Or is it trumatizing? o.o  :P Oh I was just going to ask you if you wanted to go to squires. 
oh nos, sorry about the voicemail thing, my phone was on, it's weird sometimes.. Oh, And I was just a little locked out of my house :P
aw, you didn't miss out too much. :P. I saw a kitty!! It looked scared though :(
It's fine :D! you didn't have to go to a hospital, did you?
!! O.O!!. Did you jump out of a swing too quickly?
!!!. O.O so that is it?
Oh no! stuff?
That sounds like a really really scary trip :(
I wish I were there with you to help or something
And it's alright.
Seeing you is sooo amazing though :D
Aw :/ it's very fine just... That's really scary that you tripped!!
It sounds like you went into a coma or something o.o. Do you still remember who I am? :P. !!. How many fingers do I have?!. :P
What year is it?. lol :P. yeah, I'm budding.. that's it.
Oh nos!. hmm, well are you still somehow free for tomorrow? :D
Ooh!!! :D You are? :D!!!
Oh yay :D. lol would you like to possibly grill something and "play football," possibly play pool?, and go see fireworks? :D
yay :D!!. I mean um.. cool. (:. :P
:P too excited?
because you're so so so so fun. :D!
:P sorry.. Do you think we spend too much time together?
I don't, I'm just scared that if we do too much, it could be bad. :P But it's weird, I still feel like I miss you.
Maybe. I guess I'm partially scared that you would get tired of it, and partially scared that I'm not spending enough time with friends (That probably isn't tooo affected by me seeing you a whole bunch though.). :P . I still really wanna see you though. :P It's crazy.
yay :D
You just as important if not more :D I mean, you are my friend :D
oh. Aw. I really really love spending time with you. :P lol thanks though. I bet there's enough time for everyone.
I dunno, making me feel maybe a teensy bit better. :P But you're not just some guy.. And the spending too much time together might not exactly be my opinion. I guess it's just one of those things you hear about, like the whole, "people not spending time with their friends for their boyfriend/girlfriend." And I didn't want that to happen. But I don't think it will. :P  I dunno, I have silly worries.
Yeah.. I guess some of mis amigos are out of town, too. hmm. i guess it's not too possible. :D. lol :P psh, why worry?
Aw :/ Maybe you just need more proof or something? :D. you really are amazing though. :P lol sorry. My efforts to tell you different probably aren't doing well.
There's so much proof. :P . lol if not all the stuff you do, then at least all the smiles of the people you're around :D
(: Yay.. That's good, because that's infinite proof. :P
That's okay, just know inside that a lot of people do think you're really really awesome :D and care about you and whatnot :D!. All that happy stuff :P
:P Psh, I never do anything I'm supposed to :P. Or I never know to.
Oh nos, why not?. (I really do believe all that stuff about you being awesome though) . And what would you have to worry about?
Feel free too. :D I don't think I bore easily. Pigs bore easily. :P
!!! I think when I said that, I definitely didn't mean that I wanted to spend less time with you!. sorry :P
nah, telling you that worry made it basically go away. :P In fact, I probably told you just because it was silly and telling you stuff always makes me feel better. I just hope I didn't pass it on to you.
Worrying is silly. (:. because most of the things you worry about probably won't happen/ aren't true?. :D
:P lol sorry, maybe it's a widely known fact.. People worry anyway though.
Which is very impossible! :P until it happens. (which will be never). completely reassuring answer right?
lol sorry :P I was definitely kidding about that.. I mean, I really don't know what's in store, but at the moment, doing stuff with you is super duper fun. :D And just knowing you feels awesome.
Worrying doesn't do anything though, right? like, what happens, happens? 
:P Personally, I think I'll always think you're awesome.. And amazing :D. lol :P oh no, it's like a worrying cycle.
but like, worrying can only really be a negative thing in most aspects, right? . Worrying isn't the best preventive measure?. :P lol I dunno.. Unless you have telekenisis and your worry signals can change the world :P
I think you're so great. :D And so far, I've only realized that you're more amazing than I could've imagined
:( Oh no. . That's so sad :(. What if.. it's true? o.o
but if two people are in love with each other, then does that mean that they use each other and break each others hearts? O.O
yay :D. If the person really loves the other person, then I assume that heart-breaking is out of the question unless accidental. :P. I drop things a lot.
:P Only if it's made out of ceramic.
Kidding, or course. I'll wrap it in bubblewrap :D. of*
:P Maybe it was a metaphor. Somehow.
yay (: That makes me feel better and safer too. :D. You're so awesome. :D. And an amazing bestest friend. :D!!
lol :P
yay (:. I'm gonna go eat an orange.. :P. After I say goodnight :D. Is your out-of-breathness okay? o.o! that sounds so so so scary still.
:P aw. Hopefully ntot enough to knock you out. :P. Wait, I keep leaving to go get oranges?. I'm sorry, they taste like Florida! :P. minus the swamp places which I have misplaced the name of.
Ohh, it's fine. :D I kind of figured or something.. like, if it's under an hour to respond, it's good :P. over that, I might think you left or something :P
Whoa! crazy. :P. I either pressed space somehow, forgot to send something that I typed, or was sleep-typing. :P
What you send always always matter :D! . s. even if it's just a smiley, it normally means stuff :D. G'night to you too :D. Happy Fourth of July soon! (:
(: aw, I was thinking the same thing
:D Stuff? :P. Oh no, now that you've said that, there's no going back. :P well, there is.. but I'll still be curious.
:P oh.. lol well it's fine then.. I mean, it doesn't have to be said. :P. I'm still curious though. :P
Aw (: I think hearing that is nice. :D . I really really really like you too. (: Definitely without the maybe.
:P I'm not sure. But there isn't anymore, if there ever was. :P
:P . There also happens to be a movie called "Definitely, Maybe." :P And a song.
:P lol, no it's fine. . :D It's a bad reference on my part.
:P You're the bestest! :D!!
(: I hope so, too. I have a bad grip though. :P. And you're so awesome. :D. G'night :D!. Sleep awesomely and stuff! :D. wish :D. yay :D
Whoa, white space? :P 
I scrolled up and it wasn't anything too scary though :D. but that's okay, as long as days keep coming, wishes are endless. :D. And stars. :D. Ah, you're sooo sooo cool. :D. Are you out there?
:P lol okay, yay :D
sorry, it was a silly question. :P. Aw (:
:P okay, that's good. :D! yay.. I'm a wish? :D I'll always be true. :D
:D Aw, it sounds neat. You're better than toogoodtobetrue. :P. G'night, Peter.! :D. Have an awesome sleep. :D How is the a/c?
well I still hope you sleep well! :D . Aw :P. I laheartove you too :P
:P Nothing to be sorry for.. Unless you speak Canadian. :P. wait..  :P. Goodnight. :D. ttfn
Oh whoa.. :P Well this usage is different.. :P This smiley looks happy.. And um.. :P helps with sarcasm?. And jokes?. :D
ahh :P no, not what I meant.. It's just a happy smiley.
noo, it's happy :D!. well, to me :P
It's fine. :P I mean, I'm not really sure what this smiley was intended for... hmm.. but it seems impossible to be annoyed with you. :D
:D yay! that makes sense.. :D. What if it's all meaningful though?. oh wait.. you said... "meaningful.". I think the quotation marks change it somewhat :p. G'night :D. it's fine :D!!. You can keep me as long as you wish :P
:P
Not even fireflies last forever.. And they're magic! :D. ohh :P Whoops.. :P Well sleep is nice sometimes.
:D I'd like it! :P lol I still like talking to you at times when it would be not practical in person though. :P . :D I'll try to say all the important stuff in person though.. I'll try to be all articulate. :P
G'night to you :D. (:. Enjoy the midnight fireworks. :P
There will be. :P If these scattered pops are the test fireworks.. maybe. :P. You're soooo awesome! :D Byebye!
:D! Today is a Monday.
(:. lol I keep falling asleep with my room lights on.
nooo, They're totally energy efficient. :P I don't know exactly how to take the light fixture off anyway. :P . I hope you have a good day too. :D
:D It's very good at the moment. (: I hope I see/hear fireworks all day. :P. Maybe I just need to be around you. :P lol
:P lol sorry, It's rather silly/cheesy.
I love checking lottery tickets :D. It's fun.. (even though I'm underage) :o
:P lol yeah I guess so. I know that the lottery is silly and everything though.. Maybe just once a year. :D
:P lol Psh, You're the lucky one. :P
(: Yay. lol four-leaf clovers seeem to be your specialty. :D And I'd say you're the bestest!
:D Effort points!
aw (: You're so cool, you don't even have to try. :P 
Oh no! Quick um, count to -3 backwards :P
wait :P how exactly do you do that?
ohhh, I guess it's like.. 1, 2, 3? :P. oh really? :D. yay :D
lol you're very welcome, though I'm not sure that I helped all that much. :P
yay :D. Ah, I gotta go eat and stuff :D so I'll talk to you really really soon hopefully!
lol you can suggest it anyway. :P . maybe I was following your future suggestion?. because I'm amazingly telepathic and all.. :D!
:P Anyways, talk to you later :D. You're very cool :D
Byebye!!. :D
You too. :D I hope to do stuffs :D!. With you maybe? :P
Well I very much hope it's something. :P Bye for now. :D
Oh no!!!. not thunder!!!. :P
!!!! noooo :P. rain!! :P. run!!. lol :P wanna play pool at squires?
lol yay for indoor activities. A better question though, are you free to?
alright neato :D. I'll let you get to that then?
Okay cool :D byebye for now and good luck with stuff
:D :P!
Hi :D!. I hear that you're done? :P
oh um.. :P A reallyyyy tiny frog?
lol :P Wait, you and a realllyyy tiny frog told me.. If you were one, you'd be the awesomest one ever :P
lol No way, I take my tiny frog compliments quite seriously, thank you.. :P
:D! Yay!! the sky is happy to be independent from people with cool accents and unfair taxes too (:
Soon branches will start turning into sparklers :P. And birds will start waving flags around.. And bunnies will look cute like always :P
Unfortunate, I appear to have misplaced my handheld flag. :P
oh aw (: . :P. (: . That's cute :P
brb, I'm gonna go ask my mom about said plans :P
ohhhh. :P. lol oh yeah.. today is a holiday. :P. That kind of means that Squires is closed. :P
:P ah yeah, i guess so.. lol aw. I feel like any outdoor picnics and pool barbaques (sp?) got a little cancelled today :(
I hope you do too. :D. aw, I wish I could think of more indoor stuff. :P. lol Tony Hawk :P
:D!! yay :D!. fun game :D!!
(: I wanna skate on the ferris wheel. :P
It seems so so fun! :D And I dunno, the college was more fun than it seemed.
.. :D
:P I was just thinking about how fun riding on ferris wheels sounds.. oh, on a skateboard of course :P
.. :P lol possibly playing together? I mean, it's your game though. :D. Whoa, did you know about the parade downtown today? o.o
yeah, I guess it's not exactly an orthodox independence day celebration :P
Awesome :D!! . I love firetrucks. :P I guess they were offduty today with all the rain anyway.
:P oh aw.. lol I may have been slightly asking if you wanted to play video games with me today :P
oh yeah :P Whoops.. I'm not so good at asking stuff. . :P
Oh wait, I'll do it officially.. Would you like to come over and play video games with me on this rainy Monday Fireworks Day? :D
:P Aw, scared me for a second.. :D!
but yay :D. I can come pick you up. :P!
Okay cool, are you ready whenever? :D
and yes :D!! exactly my thought :D I was thinking that I'd learn how to use the wipers.. Okay, I'll walkie-talkie alert you when we arrive. :P I mean, it beats looking out a window or listening for car sounds, right? :P
yay :D We'll be there in 15 or so I'd say. Byebye for now :D
lol awww :P my mom wasn't ready to go until like 10 minutes ago and then she said it was too rainy :P
Aw... I miss Hannah montana! :P
It's fine, there are always reruns :P Sweet dreams to you too. :D
Oh, you too of course. :D i bet it'll be nice and sunny.
i think i killed the car on my drive home. o.o hopefully it'll be okay though. G'night :D
Lol noo :P it'll be nice for at least a while.
Oh yeah, lol nice double meaning there. :P Sleep well. :D
Oh yeah :P lol two very different types of crashing. Have an amazing day! :D
thanks (: I think you're quite  amazing.
Very quite :D
:P i still think otherwise. Havin' a nice day?
It's been alright :D i think more people than i knew of are on vacation though :P
it's okay, they'll come back eventually. :P  and yeah! :D hmm.
Oh cool! :P lol. Better of worse? Hmm, There's still some time left in the day to have some fun.
Lol if you wanted to, we could do that pool thingy tonight :P
I'm definitely not tired of you, if that's possible. :P 
lol Nah, it was busted. That really is the only place I ever hear that word used though! :P 
I'd say pretty good. (: You? but aw, was that a no to pool then? :P
lol :P I'm the one who's inviting you. By default, that should mean that I want to hang out with you. I've got 'til 8 :P 
:P lol yes.
So, are ya up for it? :D
yay :D. but are you able to?
;D. :D *
I can :D!. Shall I meet you there in 10 minutes? :D
yay :D I'll bring the walkie talkie just in case
bye :D. see ya soon
:D That was fun.
:D That 8 ball is just so devious.. Or claustraphobic.
:P lol I wonder what bumper pool is like...
:D!! I think it'd be cool to try it with you. :P. It sounds fun :D. kind of like air hockey.
You're so so much fun :D!!! lol today was awesome. And I really don't think I could get tired of hanging out with you. :P
(: lol :P Needless to say, I don't agree, but I think you're really something.. And your eyes are just.. so stable. :P
:P lol It's hard to see stuff that's not there. :P You're so so so cool though. :D!!!. lol I wish I could speak spanish better.
:P Maybe if you told me in spanish it would sink in.... lol :P just kidding, but I dunno.. lol I'm trying to figure out how bumper pool is played :P
lol :P It looks so fun!! :P. like you.. And that's like, double so fun. :P. If we played together
:P noo, tu eres mucho fantastico y si yo que tu, yo iria en todas partes y seria fantastico. . o algo como este.. eso*. :P lol wow.
yeah :P I shouldn't have put the 'si' though, since it's an expression.. lol sorry, I'm trying to get some practica espanol in.
oh it's still 'if I were you' :P
lol :P not what I tried to say, but props for not having been in spanish for forever and knowing that much.. You're awesome and if I were you I would go everywhere and be awesome.. :P lol I have no idea if I used 'conditional' right. There goes my dreams of being fluent. :P maybe one day?
Maybe I'll just watch a bunch of movies in spanish and pick it up somehow. :P. lol thanks though, I find it crazy that you think that.
nah, it's okay. I'm just a non-believer. :P And I guess it's just because I don't see the same things you do.. ...!!!. ooh, I'm gonna go watch a movie in spanish :P. maybe.
:P You too! I love talking to you and just being with you. (: . It's so so awesome!
(: That's good. :D I just hope it doesn't go away.
No way, if that's the case, then I don't want to ever come to my senses. :P I'm pretty sure you're one of the funnest persons that I know though. . :P lol whoops, I said 'persons' instead of 'people'
Nopes. :P How bout when it snows on the equator?
lol oh no :P With global warming and cooling these days, who knows.. but it's pretty impossible. :D. because you're very awesome :D!
Or maybe it's just long enough.. :P
lol :P Well I'll talk to you sometime later hopefully. I wonder if that run will happen. :P lol I'll try my bestest.. :D Bye for now. And G'night! :D
(: Hearing it is nice, whether or not I believe it. :P And talking to you always makes me smile. I think you're so so perfect. (: Sweet dreams to you too. :D! . Byebye. (:
(: I'll never stop thinking those same things about you. :P Sleep amazingly. :D!
! The biggest spider ever is in my room o.o
lol :P Thanks for those encouraging words :P I got my mom to get it out. Spider is no more. :( It really was huge and scary though! o.o :P lol you're so cool.. I think I will go running. Maybe. Or something. :P Yeah.
Lol :p i like how the so is bolded.
Lol it's fine, there are other days :p i just stuck to the park anyways
Aw :( alone? Lol i'm going too :p i was updating my running songs
Lol Nah i was just being lazy :p
okay, I just ran for about two songs :P nice, right?  Good luck and everything. :D!
aw, that sounds kind of sad. :P I'm sorry, I kind of had to run early due to some lunch plan stuff. lol I'm surprised that I actually did run due to my lack of motivation (even if it was only 7 minutes) :P Have fun though :D!!! 
Lol i drove around 'dead man's curve...' :P and lived :D
Yay i'm still alive. :D even after all the stalling and whatnot. Aw, the meeting tonight got cancelled. But at least i'm alive. :P or something.
Oh nos, my thingy didn't send cause it was somewhat too long for text. :P Here, I'll try again even though it was an hour ish ago.. Lol it was a canoe club meeting. :P and oh yeah, i am :D not til six pm though, which is kind of funny since everyone knows prime blueberry picking hours are... ... in the morning. :P Maybe i'll do that crazy early morning running.. Okay there. :D! . I hope you're having a super good time with stuffs and your summer. (: Summer is nice. lol I'm so ready for some 7:00am running. :P (Maybe a little too ambitious?) Goodnight home skillz! :D Yo.. Thank you again for sushi cat (:
Thanks for the nice wishes. :p we'll just break out the golashes and umbrellas.
galoshes* (I barely ever have the opportunity to use that word.. I don't think I even knew what they were until a while ago) :P We did end up going in the rain. It didn't rain for too long, though; so all was good. You're most definitely not a bother and be sure not to disappear for too long because I already miss you... :P . Sleep well and whatnot! :D. Oh.. and do you own any cow clothing or accessories by chance?
Wait, another vacation? :D!! Where to?. Oh hi there. :D
but where else to disappear then on vacation? :P
o.o!
sounds like an inside out version of home alone. :P
You can't camp alone though. :D!
lol thanks to the invention of cans, camping has become 20x easier. :P
Spaghetti-Os and Chef Boyarde have saved the lives of many an adventurer. I'm sure all the pros just use astronaut ice cream though. . :P
lol Since when did you go pro? :P
I'm not sure, I've never seen you in action. You could be a tent-pitching, bear-rasseling legend for all I know. :P
One day I'll just hand you a lasso and watch you do wonders. :P
Aw, well, I'm sure the mustangs and cattle would be grateful if you're not. :P You have a headstart for Cow Appreciation Day.
Oh, just TOMORROW! :P. Whoa, sorry bout that Caps lock. I think the keyboard sensed my excitement.
It's like, Humpty Dumpty finally being put back together or something. :P. wait.. :P Does he ever?
It's so sad for a children's rhyme! :P Maybe it's introducing kids to the few disappointing tragedies of life. 
Poor Humpty. Unfortunate name, too. :P
Nopes, I'm good. :D Unless that was just a segue type thingy... 
Everything but talk to you?. :D. And that's fine, I'd likely sleep better.. Looks like someone misplaced their calendar.. :P. for about 3 days.. (a comment on the fireworks which you may or may not be able to hear) :P
Maybe so, but that doesn't mean it would've been a good day. :P 
Oh yeah, like an ongoing celebration? :P Or they misplaced the explosives like me..
:P That's crazy, I don't remember my early years being that amazing... Or last summer, for that matter. :P
just another time in my life that missed you. :P
:P I mean, it was alright. There was some *very* exciting muffin making. 
lol. :P Oh yes, I bet you didn't get to make bran flax muffins today. :P I hope your day was nice, regardless? :D
Regardless of your lack of bran flax muffins? :P . Oh no, so does that mean that it was only great to sarcastic people? ... Meaning that it wasn't great? ! o.o What went wrong? Or, what more would you have liked out of it?
lol. :P I wouldn't've asked if I weren't prepared to hear "boring" things. Sore from some strenuous physical activity that you may have recently done? :P
Whoa, today? 
I'm sorry, I hear that it's quite a work out. 
workout*
Nature, fighting back! That's some scary stuff.
Inanimate objects, fighting back! Still scary!
Well, do you at least have that nice accomplished feeling? :P 
Or um, some gratitude from the lawnowners?
Soreness and tiredness will wear off, but gratitude and kudos are forever. :P 
I mean, maybe they don't think about it all the time, but every now and then, even I consider the troubles that janitors and respective service peoples have to do in order to make the world live-able. And I feel like a cut and weeded lawn is as good as a well-done cut and weeded lawn, if that makes sense. :P So, lawn experience aside, I'm sure you did wonderfully and someone out there will appreciate it (even if mother nature didn't seem to.) :P
Once a year? o.o! It must be like a forest! And no one must be at least a few people. I'm sure it keeps keep the building from being uprooted or swallowed up or something like that. :D! Either way, you were helpful sounding.
And being cut does matter, though I'm sure you had not much choice in it, so all you can really do is thank the guy who invented Band-Aids. :P
Hey, you did something today that would've troubled someone else if you hadn't been there to do that, and that in itself is pretty worth the space. :D! Though I'm pretty sure that this disappearing thing isn't just about some occasional lawn-work angst? :P
Soooo....... :D. *all ears..**. (or eyes)
I'd definitely say otherwise:  that you do matter and the world would be at a huge lose without one of the greatest people ever to grace it.  However, I feel like there's not much besides words to convince you. And if it does take disappearing to prove to you how much you mean to everyone and everything, just make sure you come back before you set some kind of apocalypse into motion. :P
o.o! forced?
But if you really did disappear, you don't think anyone at all would start worrying, alerting special forces, calling the president, etc.? It's just crazy to think that anyone out there, especially you, doesn't have someone who cares about them. :D And sorry. :P I was trying to sound somewhat formal and everything. lol notice all this punctuation and Capitalization? (I always feel the need to Capitalize "Capitalization" :P)
lol I'm sorry. :P. Maybe it'll start to mean something? . Just know that you're awesome. . :P
If I were just saying it, then would I mean it like I do? :P
Oh, I do. :P
Just like anyone could be saying anything? :P 
lol It's just all a mystery.. That's where trust comes into play?
I wouldn't believe that you are even if you scared everyone half to death by disappearing unannounced.. Did I just say 'half to death'? :P take out the half..
I wish I knew. But I can definitely assure you that you're something good.. :D. That you matter. :D!! And that the world would probably be different without you.. Sounds dramatic, yet very true. :P
hmm, this is going to sound awfully cheesy and like one of those 'motivational posters' you'd see around school or in an office, or even a gym. But I recall hearing a quote somewhere that said something along the lines of.. "Six billion people in the world... Six billion souls. And sometimes, all you need is one." . :P. lol You could be that one.. :P!. so cheesy.
You = Important.. :P. Tu eres importante?. um.. hmm, so didja want to dress up like a cow with me tomorrow? :P
lol :P A white shirt with black paper spots would do.
:P It's for that Chik-fil-e (I can't spell it :P), thing.. black paper spots + tape + white shirt + 5 minutes = free food :D
:P yes.. lol It is Cow Appreciation Day, after all.
:P Not really. I mean, there are always other people to dress up like cows with, but I'm asking you. :D 
I think just you is perfect. (:
You're amazing to me. (: And just about everything. Plus one of the funnest people ever to be around! :P Aw. lol I hear frozen meat works well? :P. or is that just eyes?
Aw. :( Would a tank of helium work? :P
Or it's something? :D! Duct tape fixes everything. :P. I have a roll :D!
As long as fine means happy, I'll leave you alone :D
It rhymed though :D!
It was cool though. :D. (: 
One of the things I'll never agree to... . :D
That you're lame; you're not. (:
You just do the most amazing things, you're too cool to be lame. :P lol And you can walk--definitely not lame. :P. sorry
:P only if you're performing and need it for luck. :P . I think you're really great. (:. and not just some guy.
luck? :D
yay :D. It makes you an amazing guy who I love being around and who makes me really believe that I'm superduper lucky just because I get to talk to him. :D
I'd say it makes me casino-worthy. :P Or at least four leaf clover finding worthy. Maybe it's a different kind of luck though. (:. And a little, but you're nice to talk to. (:
You're not in the way, rather you're always there when I need you. (: . If that doesn't sound too silly. :P
I probably always do and will, but just talking to you is really cool. :P lol I don't even know what I'm saying.
:P What does taht mean? lol can you tell me what I'm saying?
Want to or have to? :P aw, well if I can still talk to you later, than maybe I should get to sleep.. How are you? (:
well, how do you feel then? Happy? :D  (: I'm pretty good. Ireally like talking to you.. And I'd be missing out on you. I guess you need sleep too though.
Aw :( empty of what?  (: It sounds nice but not as good as the real thing. :P My dreams are always way too random :P
It matters a whole bunch, because you should be all happy! :D. Can I help?
Well I'll always be here. (: Like AllState or OnStar :P
Yeah :D! Statefarm, too. I can do that. Aw. :( I'm too busy? That sounds impossible. :P. hmm, in person then? :D!
Whoa, your key does look kind of like an ood.. thingy. odd.. :P. um.. are you sleepy?
really, not sleepy? That crazy :P
aw, alrighty. Goodnight. (:. Have a super duper good day tomorrow. :P Hopefullly I'll see you maybe.. lol cow spots.
:P That's silly, it'd make my day so much better. (: Byebye for now.
pstt..
hi (:. wait... I mean.. G'night :P. or either. :P. um.
yay (:
(: I think that you're absolutely amazing.. I wish I could go yardworking with you, if only it didn't have to look perfect. :D Despite the bad sounding descriptions, it sounds kind of cool. . lol who needs sleep? :P
(:. lol I probably won't leave if you don't :P. It'd be too difficult. :P Or something like that.
aw. :P I don't think I'd ever think that.. You are so so perfect. (: It's really too good to be true.
Because you make them happy and are amazing? :D  And you even wanting to talk to me is to good to be true, let together liking me. (: 
yay. (: I'm not dreaming? :P
oh no, that'd be really scary. I almost believed it for a second, I got confused. :P . And you're right. :P there'd have been some magic elephants by now if not some self-grating cheese.
You'd be the greatest dream though. (: :P If that isn't just crazytalk, I really do like you, too. (: . but aw, okay.. Goodnight to you too. :D
lol I'll be on my neverending quest to go on morning runs.. aw (:. I mean it too. More than you could know. :P. lol
yeah :P That's where the *dun dun dun* part comes in :P
:P lol me being on to something is crazy.. and okay (:. Byebye, pefect person. (:. Boyfriend, is it? (: . sorry :P. Bye
Sorry about what? :P you too though!
Aw :/ i kind of miss you. It's like this terribly sad feeling. But i guess it's not so bad since you're nearby ish? :P sorry...
:D!! ooh, you too. (: Super duper fantastic!. And it feels like it's been pretty long. :P
:P maybe I'll just have'ta 'randomly' run into you later. And okay. (: Going somewhere fun? :P
aw, well have fun anyway. :D I hope I do. Are you free by chance?
ah, sorry. :P lol I wouldn't do it alone though. good luck, bye :D!
Oh Yay :D. Made it back before the rain? :D how was it?
Lol no, not yet. :P the world isn't ready for it yet. :P
I'm not :D lol i feel like i'm missing parts of this conversation being on a phone though :P
:P Whoa, I was missing out. :P It wasn't very tedious though.. Pretty fun, actually :D!
yay :D
I'm not sure. You saying that I say so? :P
I'm pretty good. :P Lol my computer keeps making country twang noises though.. :D! And it's raining!. :P How are you?
oh no bored? :P Maybe playing rain games could help.. Hmm, I need to go work clothes/uniform shopping today.. Which means lots of khakis and polos. :P. (I spelled khakis on my own :D!)
:P lol no, no job. It just turns out there is a dress code to the day camp thingy. lol I call them 'work clothes' because my sister had to pick the same types of clothing up when she started at Starbucks. :P
:P not exactly.. lol khakis is a cool word though.
I'm not sure, I guess it's just average stuffs. :P lol and there's a high risk of injury while trying on pants.. hmm.. now that I have a bike.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlMYWuGUZlM&feature=player_embedded
:P lol try on khaki pants regularly? 
lol Nah, my wardrobe is sadly lacking those. :P I guess just the whole 'shopping' thing is average-ish. . And it may interfere with chik-fil-a stuffs :P
yeah I guess so. :P lol I was wanting to go with someone like you though.. :P
:P eh maybeee. You're really cool though. If that means anything :P. I guess I was just hoping ta see you today. :P! . sorry, silly
lol Well I couldn't ask you to come khaki shopping with me. :P
aw okay :P. I'm gonna go possibly wash a car.. :P. :D. Even if the rain did half the work :P
Thanks :D you too!
Everything :D!
Oh, the guys name is Ed Sheeran. :D Chik-fill-a!. :D . (still can't spell it)

Very weird. :P. lol :P British Freestyle? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=temYymFGSEc. yeah, I'll go clean that car thingy :P
Thanks. (: you have fun even if you're "not doing anything" :P
oh no! I should stop saying stuffs! :P. That means we should definitely do something today :P
:P You wouldn't be in the way. You'd be conveniently there. :D
:D!
lol what do I do after I finish keepin' on?
lol okay :P I'll be sure to add that to my todo list

You're true :D
:P Wait.. Now I'm all confused.. but that's normal :P
As long as we also stick in there somewhere that You're awesome :D! 
yay :d
aw, okay :P Sorry. um. 
Saying little? :P. if not anything else..
Oh aw, but that'd be impossible. . Because your cool level is like, all the way up there. :P
:P lol you're still the coolest and most important. (:. As far as I know? :P
lol :P Wait, no question then?. wait.. that was question too.. just take out all the question marks. :P
That sounds good :D! You're never ever a bother though.. sorry
Awww, sorry to make you feel like that. lol no bleeps over here. :P the sounds... sound*... Is still kind of broken.. And you too :D. I still hope to see you later :D
And just you is a whole lot :D
No way, you're amazing :D!
I wish you felt amazing. (:. byebye for now
not if i used it on you. :D
:P Well, I don't think so. (: I use the vast majority of my wishes on you. :P. or um.. :P. sorry :P too creepy-sounding?
:P Then maybe I'm wasting my wishes, but there's nothing more I'd like to waste them on. :D
like you? :D
oh you're right. :P lol well maybe you is the best, so hmm... :P
:P so you say.. sorry :P. lol I'll let you get to something productive for a while.

That's so scary o.o maybe you conduct electricity? :D And i'm really sorry. That's no fun. :(
I liked the cow stuff a lot and just sitting with and talking to you is fun. :D what 'hole' deal? :P
!! :D. wait, don't die in a hole :( That'd be so sad. and what do you have to worry about? :P
:P I'm really really sorry.
about not knowing? And I'm sorry that I put my face so close to yours :P
:P No, It's fine. It gave me like soo many butterflies. :P I think I still have them. Sorry. Even though you said not to be sorry. :P Oh no, don't go..towards.. the hole. :P
They're like warm and fuzzy butterflies. :P And you definitely didn't mess up. . It's fine, really. I thought it was cute. (: 
and butterfly-y. (:. lol and because it's you. :P
o.o lol That'd be scary.. But you is fine :D. lol :P I should really put the you in italics or something.. so it doesn't just sound like I have have not gooder grammar. :P
:P lol I'm sorry. I think my face was just in the way. But it's fine, really. :D
:P lol a multitude of butterflies?
:D lol I already have plenty I could share. :P . But nooo, it's fine really. I shouldn't've been so close in the first place. :P
lol I get butterflies when you're anywhere in a 30 foot radius. :P . And it's really okay :P, alright? Don't worry about it. :D
What's there to worry about. :P. I don't think any differently of you for it. :P
yeah.. I guess so.. but still, it's really not your fault. :P. lol I was just asking for it, right? :P
It's really okay. :P lol I think i'll just have permanent butterflies. :P You have fun too! :D. you're warm (:
yes :P as in, I have no idea when they'll go away. :P. :D
lol We'll see when I wake up. :P
I think I miss you too much for less than 2 hours being gone. :P
aw, you're impossible to forget. And yeah. :P i wanted to watch more disney with you.. Or just play wii tennis or something.. Maybe color stuff.. :P
aw :( but pillows don't have heartbeats and who would say funny stuff?
lol no, it just kept me from hugging you probably :P Oh no :(! A desk and a light all in one day? What'll we do? :P. superglue could do the trick ;P
you were just around while it broke? :(
oh whoa.. o.o I'm imagining you holding up one of those crazy big L-shaped desks with a hutch.
aw, well no pillow compares to you. :P They don't hug back. :( And they're not very warm.. lol :P And I don't think I have any feelings for the pillow. :P
Sushi cat is nice. (: But still no you. :P
:P lol!! That's almost creepy.
I mean, it's cute, but still, hugging you is really nice. (:. lol oh, I see. :P !!! A different smiley could've changed the entire context of that. :P
:P aw, don't worry about it. :D Whatever 'it' is :P And okay
I'm still sorry about that. :P I really don't know what I was thinking.
lol :P! are you like, holding it together with the force?
!! Amazing :D lol I press one key at a time and make it superslow when I do it that way :P
!! :P 
lol I was going to say that that's really cool, but I realized that I do the same thing :P. And I'm sorry. :P I wish I knew too. I wanna say I just wanted to be close but I really don't know. :P
lol :P next time it happens? :P. You have fun too. (: And I'll try not to.. (It'll be hard though :P)
aw, well I don't think you're ever dumb. You're perfect (:. aw, from holding the table? :P
lol well I hope you don't have to hold it up all night. :P Maybe some sturdy chair or other miscellaneous handy object could do the trick? :P  And I still say it's fine. :P G'night to you too. (: . lol And sweet caramel dreams. :D
lol :P no more holes unless they're of the doughnut variety. Aw :( lol I still can't imagine what kind of table this is :P
Whoa! Antique table :D And they're still all warm :P And fuzzy.. G'night then :D
you too (: ! . lol maybe you can train yourself to hold the table while you sleep :P
:P lol both sound alright as long as you don't get splinters.
(: sounds like how I feel :P. Bye, Peter :D!
:P That one shirt? :D! The scooby doo one?. oh wait.. the button one? :D

Aw okay :P I do like staying up and talking to you though. :D Ooh can I say 'goodnight, you' too? :P I think I will. Or already have. G'night, you! :D I hope your tomorrow is very awesome.
Thanks (: I'll try not to waterlog my phone this time. :P you have fun too. (: How'd it work out with that table? Or have you been up all night holding it? :P
Oh no! I think you're very capable of a matrix dive if need be. :P and awesome :P i don't think I've really been up this early since school :P
o.o well i'm glad nothing happened in real life. :P and alright, awesome! As long as it's not a driving crash :P
I hope your day was really nice too! :D G'night!
aw, lacking what? (: I say you're amazing.
Aw, it had me in spirit though :D and okay. Lol i'm going running at 7:30 tomorrow if you'd like to tag along. :P
I'd try to be over at the huckleberry :p
Lol it's fine if it doesn't work out :p but okay, G'night!
Lol :p i'm not sure how long it'd take me to get to the trail- maybe i'll bring my walkie anyway :p
lol :D perhaps
Okay, sure thing :p
I'm heading over, no walkie talkie :p
Hey, i'm really sorry for my lateness :(
sorry for you running extra. :P 
if you say so, but I'm still sorry. And okay :D You too. lol maybe we'll get to play bumper pool. :P
lol really? I didn't say it very seriously. And you can never say "bye, forever" to anyone..
Aw okay :P . have fun at church :D!
And wearing dress clothes
:D I like you, too! (: And thanks, I'll try my best. . You're pretty amazing (:
I hope I do :D. And I don't doubt it :P. You know, you never say goodbye forever to anyone? If you care enough to say it--somewhere, they'll always be tucked in the corner of your heart. . Crazy, right? 
Oh yeah, i realized that too! It'll definitely play again though :P
:D!! Hi!. Ooh, did you catch it this time around?
lol same! :P It was like halfway through and I didn't want to start it late.
! :P. So what are you up to? :D
lol doodling is fun! :D I haven't been doing all that much, but I did get some laundry/chores done, so that's good. :D Still no luck on that project though. I was wondering if you were up for bumper pool or something similar. :D. would be*
:P you wouldn't be. :D!
positive :D
yay :D
:D I could start walking down in about 5 minutes so I'd say... 6:06? :P
nope, I'd love to see them :D
okay cool :D see ya!. Hey, are you alright? . !. sorry. :P You're probably tired of me asking variations of that. Ah, I'm really sorry for getting worried and stuff, I feel like that may have made whatever it is worse. :/. I still wish I had kept following you. :P
Sorry, my mom called me down. but aw, it's okay, honestly.
If I hadn't kept following you and asking you stuff and bothering you and bruiseing you :P (and tackleing you) you'd never have done anything silly.
It's so okay, like I'm fine with all of it and I know I definitely played a part. I just want you to be happy (sounds silly, I know--especially since me worrying about that just made it worse). I did like your Pooh Bear drawings though. :D. I wish I was a better cheerer upper :/ I should carry stuff around for situations like those :P. And I shouldn't've said anything to make you sad in the first place :(. I'm really really sorry, Peter.
:/ No forgiveness? :P. And I think I did..
:(!!!. You didn't though, right?
They were so good, and you didn't do anything wrong at all, trust me.
I even liked rabbit even though he had a sharp instrument :P. Should I know? Is it too late to find out? 
I don't even know what you should've done. :P And everything you did was perfect, okay? 
I'm regretting not being able to help :/. relieved why? :/ And sorry for possibly causing the confusion.
should've what? 
And all I want is you and for you to be happy and un-confused. :D
:/ I'm really sorry about that... I guess I was just worried really. I probably should've just let you think and stuff.. But I attacked you instead. :P. sorry.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnF4EEKcaH8 :P . lol kinda nice? :P Maybe the tackle was a little too much though?
I will :D
:P lol okay. That makes me feel a little better. Yeah, I thought you'd be able to block it if you wanted. :P
:P
Didja catch the golden snitch? :D. whoops. stitch? * :P. lol the golden tattletale
oh, that kind of fishy :P. oh really? :D. yay
Sounds cool though.. ah, I'm afraid to ask because I do too much, but are your legs okay?
That's good :D. I'm not sure.. I thought I saw you limping?
Okay, that's really nice to know :D. Whoa, scary music video.. can he play his leg? :P. calf*
lol :P
ahhh, I'm sorry :P. Maybe I should just tell you everything on my mind all the time
!!! :P the only time grammer is spelled like that.. !!! I really gotta get myself some of those feather pillows :P. We're gonna do that one day :P. or something.
make feathers explode from pillows?
yeah :D!. Oh, and I can tell you exactly what I was thinking when I kept following you... I just really thought I had said something wrong and I felt like you seemed off or something or definitely different then if I hadn't said anything and it's silly but I really couldn't leave until it was at least better. :/ I guess it didn't really work out too much though.
I just didn't want you to have'ta walk me alllllll the way home, I guess I could've said it better though. :/ . I'm sorry. You shouldn't have to get confused :/
lol There's always a way out :P. aw, really? :P it's quite senic, right?. scenic*
lol :P sounds like quite the adventure/mission.. like a heist or something.
It's fine, it's neat sounding :D
but who'll keep you safe then? :P. And you are the best :D
I care about yours :D
Everyone :P lol all the fan girls.
:P I hope I'm not considered a fan girl, but I'd be yours. :P Your best friend :D!
And my boyfriend?. :D. I still don't know the difference too much though :P
oh no, is part of the confusion about boyfriend/girlfriend stuffs? :P
I wish I did. :P
I guess I meant like that question "Am I just your friend?"
lol no :P 
I was relating it to the boyfriend/girlfriend stuffs
And if those connected somehow?
if that's what we are? If I'm doing it right? . :P
oh, well I'll be okay with being boyfriend and girlfriend as long as you are. :P I do wonder how it'd be different any other way though. They seem about the same :D
:P Nah, I'd still like to see you quite a lot either way. . aw, I don't think I'm a very good girlfriend. :/
I guess I just don't do girlfriend-y stuff? . :P. lol should I expand on that too?. I'm not so good at cheering you up and I feel like I don't know enough about you still.. hmm
small stuff I'd say, stuff I probably have to find out through time? :P Or just a lot of questions.  Hey, I would've stayed forever if I didn't have a curfew. :P
lol :P that stuff too :D!. is it?
me too :D I think.. hmm
lol It's hard to describe :P I wanna say just everything. Like what you like or don't like, how you respond to stuff, your opinions on everything. :P Basically everything and things I'll find out eventually.
:P You must think I'm crazy.
If you say so. :P
I guess so. :P To wonder about everything? :P
:P It makes pefect sense :D
:P Yes?
...is it.. blue bowling balls?. or florescent colored ones? :P
lol :P
you get that question a lot?
:P That is kind of silly, but I guess when people are dating, it's just expected? 
:P lol you could
aw, people are fun to talk to though :D
lol :P . oh.. hmm.
maybe not necessarily... :P
I guess it depends if they'll ask more after that :P
lol I've been asked that twice
yeah :P
oh. lol :P
I guess the same person asked me twice too.. it's not so bad though :P
lol just say 'maybe'. while slowly walking away.. :P
mayyybeee". lol :P. something like that
slowly so they can catch up of course
:P lol they stop if they see you don't want to answer
oh. hmm :P. That freckle on my hand is still there!! o.o. I'm worried
who gets freckles on their palm? :P
:P lol thanks, though I'm not all that amazing super special awesome :P 
and why don't you have any palm freckles then? :P. aw.. sadish face?
you're quite amazing. (: And i'm sorry. :/ It's just impossible to accept. I did say thank you though? :P
:P if you believe, then you can achieve; so, nothing is impossible? :D  aw. Like how I feel about you? :D
:P did you accidently press the button?
lol it's okay, I think those are cute
:P. yes. :P They are though, right? especially when bunnies do it ;D. :D*
That smiley still says 'walrus' to me :P
oh :P lol sure, why not?
oh, me?
:P lol I was thinking "it's your nose." :P. It's fine, unless it's an especially comfy hole.
with blankets? :D!
yup :D I know of that
lol It's fine :P oh, and that was before I knew who you were planning on giving it to :P
:P
bunnies? :D. aw. :3
I don't think anything you've said is dumb. :D And it's completely fine! :P
:P lol That makes a lot of sense.
it's okay (:. You're the bestest.. And the most amazing :D. I'd never ever think you're dumb/. .*
:P depends what 'anything' is. I'd say you're really smart :D
:P oh.. lol I still don't know about that.. I was just confused. :P or just wanted to get close or something. ah. I'm sorry :P
lol confused as in disoriented, I was just kidding about that ish though.
I'm sorry :P I'll try not to without warning or something
:P I wish I knew what was going on in my head myself.
It's fine, honestly :D. It's not like you jumped out of nowhere :P. or something.
:P It's okay, I had time to pull away :P lol
:P I don't even know.
lol I like silly music :P
it's okay :P I'm not ticklish. 
:P lol oh, I was just um.. exercising. Gotta get that 2-pack back, right? :P    
you do :P lol I don't know what it is, maybe it's just like laundry softener smell or something :P. aw. you're not stupid, never ever.. You're awesome :D. :/ I just wish I was better or something
y'know... but thanks (:
aw (: . You're super duper special (:
Thanks for being amazing (:

:/ hmm. sorry :P
(: Thanks for saying so, it's really nice sounding. . lol whoa, I suddenly feel like eating breakfast foods.
yum :D
I'll always always care about you (:. ah, I'm sorry :P
would you ever ever be okay with just friends? :P 
I'm sorry I keep saying stuff like that :/
oh no :/ It's just the same worry as before I suppose. I'm really sorry. I'd never ever ever break your heart. It's silly though because I'd only be just friends if everything stayed the same :P 
just the whole um.. kissing thing. I know it shouldn't be a big thing but I dunno. :/ I don't even know what you'd say when I tell you I'm too scared to for the ways of the Eskimos too :P
maybe..
aw, nice smiley :P
lol I guess you're right, but it'd be even more less important as just friends? :P And the questions could go away.
lol silly is a silly word :D . I kinda like it.
ah, well okay. (: 
lol :P Eskimos are cool people though :D
It's fine :P  I still think they're cute.
:P or bunnies? :d
I don't even know if I know..
aw, I think I'm scared of everything about it.. hmm. :/
do you say what you mean? :P 
I don't know, I just want you to be happy and everything. And yes :D I hope so. Though some things may be left unsaid, I do mean everything I say. :P
lol and it was a comment on your comment :P. on a chair?
or stand how?
(: aw.
That's nice.. oh, that one :P. I think I know
lol how does a dashboard melt?. And I'll try to believe you as best I can :P. (:. my room is freeeeezing :P
And the radio is metal-y? :D lol and covered in melted plastic. I will try. :P There's just so much against it though.

I hope you had a super duper amazing day :D!. It sounds so familiar. :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyMhvkC3A84

Mine was alright :D It was pretty hot. And I did some 'forest' walking. Ooh, and bus riding :D and um.. breakfast bar eating :P 
Whoa cool!! Lawns are fun :D. Did you use a lawn mower?. :P
:P!!! As long as you didn't run with them, but maybe it's safe with 'safety scissors'? What are safety scissors anyway? :P Scissors that aren't sharp?
!!! o.o! that's so scary! :P I was running with baby scissors and got scared, so I walked. :P
!!! lol stairs are scarier because of gravity.
And lived to tell the tale :D. You could save lives with this touching story. :P
They should invent a little zipline system to safely transport scissors and knives and other dangerously sharp objects down the stairs!. It's just too much of a risk to carry them yourself. :P
:D 
:D song? !!. it sounds familiar. :P. well, only a little.
Is that the song? :P. oh, just kidding. :P. I have heard that song.. Just didn't catch the lyrics
lol or didn't listen long enough to :P It seemed nice though.
:P sorry, I feel like I interrupted some of your typing there.

Cool :D. reminds you of..? . life back in the city? :P
those nostalgic days by the lakehouse? :P
!!! oh no.. :P wait, continue... please

:P let me guess, another bandaid?. You're okay though, right?
lol you seem to be running at a 2 cuts every 5 minute rate at the moment, it's making me kind of worried :P
o.o. But outdoors is where all the fun stuff is :P
:P you've been outside without dying before though, right?. Maybe you can just get one of those giant hamster wheels :P
There's always something to do. :P. and not in a "work" kind of way :P
:P stuff I could do.. hmm.. Nothings as fun alone though :P
:P aw. no, I feel like I haven't gotten to talk to you all that often.
It's fun :D. lol that's ironic :P. Or something
You're never ever ever a waste because I always love talking to you. :D!. I feel like making ice cube ice cream :P Or making some use of that "mini doughnut pan"
:P lol you're not lame and I'd rather talk to you thank make ice cube shaped ice cream :D. It does sound like a neat project though :p
:P How amazing does it sound?
Whoa, it's like.. big.. and bold.. :P . How is that possible? :P. but not more amazing than you.. In fact, I'd rather invite you over and make it with you :P

Yeah, I guess so. :P There's um.. Luster's Gate/Deer Croft.. and then um.. Mt. Tabor, and Tom's Creek.. and.. Ah, too many sides on this polygon.. sorry :P 
Okay. Good luck in whatever you're doing :D. if I can't wish you a fun time, maybe luck is the next best thing? :P sorry.

thanks (: It's fine though.. I mean all we'd do is possibly make pizza :P
aw, you just left though :P (which was sad by the way)
hey, I could prep all the stuff :D and then you could come
It may mean more like.. in 15 minutes :P. if that's alright
lol :D aw, you'd make it awesome :D. I'll clear some space in the kitchen :D
It'd be fine :D. I'd love seeing you again :P. as long as you wouldn't mind. and as long as you're allowed to.. I feel so bad for not knowing ahead of time :P
:P lol whoa! just as surprised as my mom was that you left?

Awesome :D

:p You're pretty cool.. Aw. I like my neighbor's dog
ooh, i'm here :D. Thank you so so so much for everything :D. lol whoa.. I had the weirdest dream ever. but you were in it :P
I woke up making beatbox noises, because that's what I was doing in my dream. lol someone asked me to do the beat to this one song so they could sing it. I can't think of the name of the song, but it's totally a real thing :P
:P when I find out the title, I'll totally send it to you
me too :D. I think :P
:D!
:P It's cool, all I have to do is post office and some stuffs
you're not :P trust me
:P lol Well I'd never need that receipt :D. except for tax purposes maybe :P
:P Aw (: Well you're a gift I wouldn't mind receiving twice? :P. lol "The gift that keeps on giving". was that a slogan for something?
!! crazy stuff :D
:D You made it amazing mostly :D!
It's not :D. I liked the pizza :D It actually turned out better than I thought, though I'm sure it was no comparison to yours :D!
:P you don't have'ta be modest. I know you're secretly a talented italian pizza maker
lol :P or only because of that. You're so so awesome!! :D
okay :D. psst.... you areeeee...
you are awesome :p. sorry bout the '...'
:P ooh, what were you gonna ask?. and you don't have to be sorry for everything (:. it was awesome watching movies with you yesterday (:. and I liked the scavenger hunt
:D I can take you home!
no way :P we'd be going home anyway.. and if you'd feel any better, we don't even have to take you to your house-we'd just go straight home so it'd wouldn't be out of the way even a bit :P. lol we could go get thai food :D. or something... hmm
lol like, go to my home
but we wouldn't do that unless you really did feel like a bother :p
nopes :d. and you wouldn't be in the way :D. since you live so close anyway. if you lived in mt. tabor though, that might be a little different
:D It'd be so fun!. wait.. which part if fun? :D the Thai food or orientation or taking you home?. I'd say all are, but I'm wondering which you mean :P
:P. aw... thanks for that :P You're so so so much fun to be with.. lol I woke up and there were only 3 of your cupcakes left :P. I asked my mom if she got hungry, but turns out she just put them in an airtight container. :D
:P I like them (: my mom actually did have 2 of them though. :P even on her 'diet' . :D you're welcome to have another if they survive long enough. aw :P I was about to, but then I took out my contacts and passed out on my bed instead. thank you for helping clean up and everything :D
yum (: maybe for some other holiday. They sounded like they took quite awhile though, so it's no problem. :P ooh yeah, I've been getting into the habit, so that's good. :D lol you're welcome. funny thing to thank someone for though. :P. that's like Cinderella thanking her stepsisters :P. maybe she did... hmm..
:D That's exactly how I feel with you :D!. And you staying longer is always nice. I really hope your schedule works out the way you want it to! :D
:/ aw... well even if you don't get what you want, there's still a chance to talk to guidance about it and see what they can do :D. they're normally really flexible with seniors especially. first pick for you guys. hmm.. :D yeah
Yeah, I was thinking it was because the two classes that you want to take are happening at the same time or something? :/ t. sorry, cameo 't'
aw.. My sister had to let go of engineering because of schedule conflicting, it worked out alright though. :D . And don't worry about that if it interferes with your classes. :D It'd be cool, but remember, I'm an excellent stalker. :D
aw.. psh, who needs English class.. :P . lol just kidding, of course.
lol is it possible to drop english?
you could always randomly take AP Psych :P. I don't know how that would go for you though. ohh, I get it. :D you could get a different teacher. hmm
lol yes :P But don't let that influence you in anyway. It doesn't seem quite relevant to your cirriculum
And my sister says Mrs. Session is 'crazy' :P I'm not sure though. Whoa :D that's kind of neat
it's 2nd :P. lol whoa.. very relevant?. Psych is a cool class :D
lol :P bad idea then
you could still take it a different period though, if you wanted. lol :P English always did scare me
They could :D. but a note of warning... I heard that the AP ones are superduper hard without teachers o.o. could be just the math ones though. :P 
whoa. he's doing online classes? :P!!. cool stuff!. It sounds like a good way to get some classes in. especially if they are easy to learn ones :D
:D I'm not, I do have'ta go to the post office right around now though. We can give you a ride home from orientation :D
:D It's no problem at all . see ya then :D. thanks again for the cupcakes
yeah :D Byebye!
thanks :P Post offices are cool :D
:P lol it'll be the one nearer to university mall.. but i'd say both are fun :D. bye for now!
yeah, fo sho. bye :D
You're amazing :D sorry you had to go home before adventure time :( have fun at cross country tomorrow! :D
That inconvenient thing makes sense :D lol I should run more. . but aw :/ you shouldn't feel like an awful person. And don't worry, I'm almost done with your zune :P
it's fine :D
That's good that your bikes there :P. just in case it'd still be in a car somewhere?. And you're definitely not wasting my time :D. you're fun to talk to (:
you're not lame :D!
that sounds fun :D. And don't be sorry, talking to you is awesome!!
:P you're like, the opposite of a bother (:. but you have fun too :D!
why not :/. ?*
:/ I wish I knew why.
Is it because I'm holding your zune captive? :P. Do you need to talk to someone or another? because I'm always here :D
but like.. you're not a waste of time at all :D
:/ but you do everyyytthing right :D
I think you do :D

:/ I'm sorry too. your cupcakes are really good. especially the cream cheese filling :p. how did you get that in there anyway?
That's awesome :D!. And it's fine.. the last thing i'd want is you feeling terrible :(. You're amazing (:
:P lol maybe I do try. I really really like being with you :D. lol :P eBay is so weird.. people actually bid on online coffee.
lol you're right :P that would be weird :P
:/ I mean, I know you said it jokingly.. 
ooh, so there's still a wish I don't know? :P
and you're always important :D
:D!!! amazing :D
what is he searching for?
and it's fine.. I don't feel obligated I guess.. But if it'd help or something :P. I dunno.. it sounds silly now :p
it's fine :D. I hope he finds whatever he's searching for :P. I hope you find whatever you wished for :D
depends what you wished for :D. lol I sold something.. but now I don't know where I put it... :P
yeah :P hmm..
I still have a day to find it though :P
I wonder what you wished for... I have trouble waiting on crockpot food... because it's like.. there.. but it's not cooked :P
keep going :D. if you want.. this is a no-judging zone :P. lol sorry :P 
aw.. is that what you wished for? :D 
and I like talking to you the mostest. when I can (:
It's so fun :D (: . I wish I knew you were happy more often though.. . but that just means I have'ta try harder :P. and that I'm not doing stuff well enough
aw really? :/ I'm sorry. it's silly but I feel like that too :P
:P you don't do anything, It's just a feeling. *feeling like I'm bothering you, or like you're mad at me or something (which you have every reason to be)
well I'm perfectly fine with you bothering me :D I'd prefer that you be the one to bother me
:P. lol :P. aw. I feel like eating some chicken soup
one day in the winter, I'm gonna make some.. sorry :P
aw :/. well I'll try to make it easier for you to bother me then :P
but you're never anything like that, especially not mean
:P
lol the endless battle of head vs. heart
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4EMgyVWk. lol :P it's rap.
sorry :P it may or may not be relevant
there is nothing to worry about (:
lol you gotta drown that guy out :P. sorry :P I think all of you is perfect... but it'd be sad if you were making yourself sad :( i still feel like it's me. and what you're saying makes sense :D
aw :/ but even if other people could make me happy, I'd still want to see you. I just love being around you :D. and seeing you and hearing stuff that you say. you're so amazing
aw.. (: lol. there's always that bike lock..oh nos, I forgot about all the forms to fill out :P. and I'll have to make sure you stay somehow then :P If you're saying that you really want toHi Christine! I hope you had a super duper awesome break too!  Yup, definitely can do that. I'm holding a OH from 2-3pm in Rice 436. Does that work for you?. Oh yeah, it was on slack at some point. I just sent out an e-mail too, thanks for the reminder! :P. And see you then!. Oh hi! I hear that you do Algorithms extra credit checking for Robins. I was wondering... How many TED talks would I need to watch/summarize to make 10% extra credit?Thanks for the detailed breakdown!! I thought it would be more like 90 or so videos, so that's a relief (::D Is that because you're so cool?
Haha :P I have a long way to go before I can ignite on command.. Whoa, upside down person. <(.-.)>
hehe :P New trick...
That's what the ice is for!. Right? :P
Unless you forgot it :O
Just like that chocolate :(
Note to self: avoid storing butter in pockets
Haha :P  + chocolate = cocoa butter?. Mmm, enjoy the ribs!  Oh, why in McLean?
Yeah! This is my office: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Capital+One+Bank/@38.924185,-77.21318,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xb1c8082dfdde581d?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT9qSq8q3NAhVD22MKHSroBxIQ_BIIcTAK. Ice cream social sounds really cool!. I definitely would not eat those brownies :P  But very cool.
Whoa!! We should take advantage of this opportunity! Any plans after work yet?. Oh, game changer...!
Is it Jazz in the gardens?. sculpture garden*
Lunch would be awesome! We are having a Lunch and Learn tomorrow, so it wouldn't be ideal for conversations, but you're still welcome to join. :P
Oh, I see..!. It's a catered event where a Capital One employee gives a talk on a tech topic.. This week is "Clean Code"
You'd probably be fine since they have lots of extra food, but I understand your concerns :P. It's normally super informal, but we can do lunch another time when you are in the area!
Oh! I haven't seen that meme yet.  But yay, lunch buds!
hehe, good question...! I am free tomorrow and Saturday before late :D
Working 8ish-5pm (but very flexible), and the rest is still a mystery! Or do you mean during the work day part?
Ah yes, busy 10-10:30am and 12-1pm for the Lunch and Learn (still open invite :D)
You mean 10:45*? 15 minutes is too short for anything :P. Any fun events at Booz Allen I can crash?. Probably harder for me since I would have to park.. hehe, sorry, don't mean to sound imposing :P Mostly joking.. But that ice cream! om nom
hehe, Camo time!
They have cool hats!
Wait, ice cream delivery? That's really fancy...
Yeah, I was just thinking that I've never actually heard of delivery ice cream :D !
Just the Capital One Cafe/Grill. :P I've never explored outside options.... I bet there are some cool places though!. Also, don't worry about fitting something in with me tomorrow--we can just do a meetup on Saturday ^-^. Well, after work Friday is still game.
That sounds good :D Haha, I am so devoid of cool places at the moment: Have only been to the house I'm staying in, Dollar Tree, and the Gas station :P. But the summer is early....
er um.. "young"
Jazz festival for the win!
:D!!!
Saturday is good, I'll keep thinking on activities, but there is always museums/national mall to fall back on (did you say you had or hadn't done that recently?)  We are free to manage our own time as long as we deliver, and it is great!
Oh, switch to messenger?. I'm still good for Saturday for sure!
Where are you headed after work? Taking the metro back to DC?
Nice!  I haven't been on the DC metro this summer yet :O
Did you decide between jazz and the baseball game?
Yay jazz! Private event?. (Probably my way of asking if I can tag along :P) There are a group of interns here going to the food truck event, so that was my backup plan!
Yeah, as long as you won't be tired of me! :P. Well, were going with a group from your work already?
No way, that's crazy :D Haha, well I guess that's what you would do for a Klondike bar...!. Currently planning crazy things with Docker, Node, Mongo, Jenkins, and AWS.Contemplating doing more coding instead of going to the jazz festival. :P. Jazz in the garden*
You already have a group of interns that you're going over with, right?
Hmm, I hear some of the food trucks are from New York..!
Nice! Well I'll just stay at work later and then be at the food truck festival by 8pm :D I hear the metro rates go down after 7pm
Nice! I think Jazz in the Garden is 5-8:30pm. Looking forward to seeing you too :P Going to food trucks after jazz?
Probably just straight to food trucks since I'll be there at 8! (:. Enjoy the jazz though!
Heading down now! Arrival 8:03. (At Navy Yard)
No way, did jazz already?!
Sounds good (:
Isn't it far to walk from Navy Yard?. I'm meeting some people at the fair!
Oh cool!!
Fair
I'm in line for empandadas :P. Panda!
Okay :D. Okay, Goin to the tents
Where are you right now?. Now at front middle table near bullpen. So 9am tomorrow?. I'll see how the metro timetable works out. Will you meet me at the station?. Or is your place on the way to the national mall?
Nice! I am about to reach my metro stop in 5 minutes :o. I am glad I had company for the ride!. I always have P&P on my phone just in case though. Pride and prejudice :P
Just start reading aloud, and the attacker will be hooked!
^-^. Self defense 101. Have you ever taken a class?
Once. We got to attack police people holding protective pads
That sounds like fun!!
I'll probably need to leave before 4 -- Just need to make it back to McLean station by 4:08pm. :D
Eating breakfast or together?
Wup wup,. Woo, caught the metro, should be there by 10 if I got on the right one :P. By the way, we are walking from Foggy bottom, right? If we were taking the metro, I would stay behind the gates and wait for you
Okay, no worries, I am still in transit! Just thinking ahead. Eta still 10pm
Am*. Yup, the train is just using brownian motion. That would be a sweet metro ride!!
Here!
It was good to see you too!!!
Yes, definitely again! Also, I would love to hear your guitar playing some time! And Hamilton..!. Who knows, might be me who is late next time ;P .
Thank you to you too :D It was super fun! Goodnight!. Do you have Venmo?
Haha, was going to pay you back to even out the food purchases from yesterday!
Haha, no problem1
Well I'll just get you back next time!
Sure thing ;P  What are you up to today?
Oh, which game? I went to church and lunch and am doing misc todo list tasks like booking a flight and applying to a thingy.
Nice!! I hope it's a good one! Have you been keeping up with a certain team?  They are having the wedding reception right now and I will be there afterwards to help clean up and earn some leftovers :D!
Technically it is a post-post-wedding reception since the couple was married on April 9th! :P  I'll send you pictures of the food though :D Enjoy the game!! Are you rooting for Cavs or Warriors?
Wow, that's really nice!! ^-^ Did they visit for Father's Day? Oh man, I'm excited for the kimchi for sure!. Haha, two cocky teams should make for an interesting game...
I am flying to Houston for the Grace Hopper Convention in October!
Bunny swarm is real.
Hehe ^-^ I'm looking through all the pictures from Japan now. Nothing to cheer you up like a bunch of bunnies!!
Oh that's cool!! :D Thanks for sending.. Hedgehog.. lost in translation
Not yet :P But soon....
I'll check it out now!. Wait, they just fell asleep and missed a party?. :P
Yup yup!
Oh no, did he think I meant something by it? Or was it just random? :P. Oh I get it :P haha, and that was like the only time he ever shopped there?
Clearly we need to be reintroduced :P. Haha! !. If it helps, I thought it was cool at the time!!
With violent tendancies?. :P well thanks
That's great :P I'm sorry to have caused him teasing though!. What is whole food guy's name?
Okay, Patrick it is!. ;P
What will our next hang out be?. Hearing you play guitar?
Oh, you... :P. And mustache disguises?
They'll be sure to recognize us then!. The smelly sample squad!. Let's stick to the you playing guitar idea!!. :D
That makes such a great image in my head (imagining the guitar + mustache combo)!
Hmm, my favorite songs aren't quite ordered, but I'll go with Folding Chair by Regina Spektor randomly!
Oh yeah :P I showed you that one!
If you want a new song... Let me check my spotify!
Wow, nice memory!
Intense!
I got distracted by my Discover Weekly! :P. I like... Brighter than the Sun - Colbie Caillat Come to Me - Goo Goo Dolls I Lived - OneRepublic
Hahahahaha :DD!!!! Pants. Well I don't know the Hamilton songs yet, so you'll have to direct me to though!. I'm going to get to sleep! :D. Good night!
Go Cavs? :D
Hey, I thought you were neutral
I feel like I'm missing some details here, but it sounds like a bad ending for Steph Curry.  (3 wins, 1 loss?). And the quote from the Drake song went right by me!. :P Teach me your ways
Oh wow, that must've been really hard on the team to come that close and get 3 tries to win it!. Thanks for explaining!
Oh yeah, that's me :P !! My day was very good. The project I'm doing is pretty intensive though, but hopefully I'll get the hang of it! I'm going to sleep now, but write me how your day was too, and I'll get to see it in the morning!. Good night!
Hey, good luck with the presentation! You're great at those!  And thanks! Maybe his statue will come to life and I can pair program with him!
Howdy!
I'm doing well :D ! Just trying to make docker work :P How was the presentation?
Haha, no worries! Yup, I have skype
Aw, better luck next time!. That's neat about the presentation, though!. Informal can be nice sometimes.
I've just been fighting the corporate proxy today, hopefully I can get things sorted out now :D  !  I'm keeping up with my 28 day workout calendar... day 4 so far! And I practice my singing in the car when I drive to and from work. & spent some time with my guitar today too!
Haha, I'll be climbing the Lincoln memorial stairs like Rocky in no time.. Do you play guitar often?
Oh sweet! What are you playing?. Concussion by orange. :P
Haha, nice :P An original styling?
Dude, I would be so honored to do a duet with you. :O Aren't you like a pro singer?
Hey, I'm sorry I missed this earlier! No, I am hanging with my boyfriend this weekend, but I hope you have a great time! !!. Going to the nats game? :P
Yeah! I'm thinking we'll have lots of extra tickets. It'll be a rainy one though!
Would you like to come to the Nats game?. It's just super crowded if you go by metro though!
Sweet! I'll get you one!
Don't have it yet,  but it's looking like there will be extras! I can meet you at the gate. Bring a poncho if you don't want to get soaked!
Noww
Haha, I'm in transit
Oh, it's cool if you come late!. How longs the game?
7pm !
I bet the metro will calm down more if you come a bit later too. So no worries!
Oh I'll get you that ticket. Meeting at centerfield gate!. Let me know when you're close!
I'll look out for you!. Let me know when you're close to centerfield!
Okay cool!!. Got your ticket !
Rain jacket!. Rightfield entrance is closer if you can make it!. Wow, make that First base gate. It's a big ballpark!
Jk center field... we just walked the wrong way around :P
How close are you?
Give me a heads up when you are
Cool sweet!. I'm at centerfield past security on the right
derp
Yo. Hover hand?
Ohhh! I didn't read the urban dictionary one, but that sounds familiar!. It can apply to other situations too!
What what? my hover hand?. :P
Nice!!! Where is said hover hand?
Yes!!
Oh, that's fantastic!. :O Another one?. Or just that one?. I think it was just at the end of photo taking and we were about to disassemble!. :P
hehe, well definitely thank you for sharing!
No way!! That is so great! :P. Which game?
How can dis be?. O.o
Haha, no worries :D!!!. I had a great time with you!
Whoa, what a coincidence!!  :D Is it react native or phone gap?. Sorry I didn't get to this earlier!
Oh yeah :P Still thinking the word app refers to mobile
Yeah ! We are doing a "mission case competition" together.
Oh yeah! :D He is pretty fancy!! It's beat how many people you can run into. Were you there for the overnight museum opening?
Nice! All from BoozAllen you mean?. NYC was really cool!! Really awesome city,and definitely still a lot more to see
Nope, in DC!
Oh, I was at the Capitol Fourth concert on the mall!. Leaving for the Hackathon in Richmond today!. I'm going to try and make a drone atm?
Yeah!! Adam!
Oh hey, pictures??. It went really well!!
Okay good! (: Yes! It is a drone atm. I was really proud of it for sure. How is the intern life?
Oh no, we used AR Parrot drone as a base!. Sounds wise! Life is life is life. I hope that whatever my work is will be really enjoyable!. I'm rooting for you at trivia! Goodnight for now (:
We stayed up for the hackathon :P You know how that is
Hi! I am in Oakville, VA!
Whoa, in Oakville? Or you mean McLean? That is sounds pretty neat! How did Trivia night go?
Woo!!! Go Eric!! Is this a public place or an Intern thing?
Oh, I meant the Trivia night. :P I might be interested.. I'm doing well! We are just about to head out to a nearby lake.. How are you?. Ah, we are leaving now, so I will catch your reply later!!. Happy Saturday (:
Sunday funday?
Hi!. It was just a random comment :P
Today? :D Oh sweet! I'll have some extra time after work (4pm onward) since we're doing a volunteer event today at a middle school. When are you off?
Cool! I could pick you up and we could go do an activity!. Some outdoor activity.. Dave and Buster's... Trapeze school.. Bowling in Canada?
Oh what time is dinner?. We could do something nearby!
Okay, I'm free now, but I'll keep thinking of a thing to do!. Options: walk around Great Falls Park, go ice skating at Ballston, listen to you play guitar, check out DuPont circle. I'm leaning toward Great Falls park if you're wearing okay shoes!. I'm going to head over just in case... (It's only 6 minutes away, anyway (: )
Oh that's fine! Hi!. Haven't left yet! Send a pin. Location pin*
Cool! 3 minutes away. Is there parking? I could hang in the lobby til you're done. There's probably temp parking! Let me know when you're go to go, but take your time!
Okay, sounds good!
Sure sure!. About to leave now..!. Here orange car!. At front
Thank you!!. Haha, that last one
That sounds awesome, but I am 90% sure I'm going to be in Pennsylvania this weekend (Hershey Park)
Thank you!! How was New York? :D!!!
Whoops, I must've gone to sleep before I replied to this one!  Sweet picture!! I'm looking forward to hearing all the things you learned :D You going to be in McLean anytime this or next week? Otherwise I'll make a trip out t o Foggy Bottom :P. My weekend was great! Spent some time with some C1 interns and also my friend James.. The Air and Space Museum extension in Herndon is really cool!!
Whoa, will you finish with your internship on Friday?
Oh okay!! Commuting from elsewhere? Also, thanks for the invite!  I'm gone Friday, but I will definitely see you before the summer ends!!!
Haha, that sounds like a neat situation to be in! Would offer my place if I weren't renting :P . I hope you find the Best Couch Ever. A hackathon already? I am going to Blacksburg for the annual summer festival!
It's a street fair with some live music and craft vendors!. I'll ask around tomorrow and see if some of the interns in apartments have some space!
What a coincidence, I'm out by then too!. Hi! Have you found a place?
Oh that's awesome! My friend Frank has a place in Clarendon, but I am very glad you found one!
P.s. What are your plans for the day?
Wow wow! Which restaurant?
Happy last day (:
Oh hey, that's a good place!
Tomorrow's my last day!
Is it practical to say bye to you today or not? Maybe give you a clif bar as a parting gift...  Or I'll just see another time :D Maryland's not so far!
Yes!! :D Let me know when you apply to ones, too
Hi! No worries at all. (Oh man, deflated air matress? :P) I could have done a lot more to reach out to you too, so my bad too! But I hope school is going well for you this year!! So cool that you have a gf!
Ayy, it goes well!!!. How are you? :D !!
Ooh, like interviewing? Or do you mean personal projects? :D  School is great! Doing some really neat projects in my Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision classes.  Figure skating and breakdancing are fun! And I'm writing a song (?) :O
Yay, I'm glad you are really working on those Quadrant 2 activities!
:P They are like.. activities that aren't urgent, but are important (so a lot of people don't do them, but they provide the most benefit to our lives).  In NLP I am making a Chrome Web Extension that will connect to different Facebook Carpool Groups and make them easier to search (I'll put the routes on a map). In CV, I'm making a mobile app called FaceAttendance, that checks attendance using peoples faces (you just do a film pass over the people's faces and it will check who is missing based on face detection).. whoops, film pass sounds kind of weird, I mean like.. camera pass
The song will be something that I write, and my goal is to release it before I graduate :P I'm trying to devote a lot of time to interview studying since I want a cool job.. What projects do you speak of?
Capital One is fantastic, but Google is a dream :3 !. Computer vision recognition these days is a lot of neural networks(NN)! We would build a CNN that takes two faces and can tell how similar they are, and then use that to identify faces :O.. I would say data structures and algorithms are definitely a huge foundation to everything else! It's so fantastic that you are working on projects outside of classes!!! :D!!!!!!! And wow, congrats on the Hackathon!!! Do you have a link to your devpost so I can check out the project?. It would be fun to work with you again! ^-^. :O Are you aware that you "like" Donald Trump on Facebook?
Yes, but I decided not to go because it's parent's weekend and my mom will be visiting!
Ah, yeah that would be awesome!!  There's still Bitcamp though! I hope all is well with you too :D. I am going to YHacks though!
I think registration closed already, but there could be a way to sneak in!. Yeah, definitely lots of work here too!
Hi Eric!! It's going really well! I'm still in Belize for an Ecology class. How about you?
Oh hey dude!!. :O I went MIA on your last question. Oh which winter course did you take?
Communications as in technically or like public speaking? :P
Oh sweet! Was that pretty helpful?. Also I've been good!! How about yourself?
That great! Do you happen to have a syllabus/description of exercises you guys did? I've been meaning to do some organized practice.. That's great about classes!. I'm in some really cool robotics classes this semester, attending some hackathons, working hard at breakdancing, and learning Chinese :P and soccer juggling.
Haha, guess I just have to practice then. Yes, Chinese :P. Wo bu dong
Hah :P Ooh, what's the link?. We could have a reunion :O!!. Oh, I think I found it!. Mhacks9?
Wow, adult life too near :O. There's always bitcamp too, right?
Noo, there will be more opportunities always. SF isn't so far away... But yes, I would like to stay in touch for sure!
Oh, I'm going to be returning to Capital One :D !!. At their SF office!
Any summer plans for you?
Oh hey!! Congrats (:. Hehe the bank life
You've got another year for interning to get that tech company experience! (:. But I bet you'll bring all the tech with you and really start it up :D
Internships are pretty fun (: ! I am looking forward to it. San Francisco is going to have a lot going on, plus I am really looking forward to learning a lot technically and making connections in the tech field as well as working on side projects!
Haha, if only it were that easy. What are some of the classes you like this semester?Whoa, those do sound like awesome classes!! :O Yes, learning the wonders of programming is super fun  ^-^. Any cool side projects?. Or other things you are up to? :DThank you!! Really appreciate it
I totally am!! 
Whoa, that works so perfectly, because I will be on the bus to go there, but I might not be on the way back!. Also, I would love to be on a team with you! That sounds amazing awesome fantastic! I am still seeing whether I will be able to do all my homework before the hackathon that way I can focus on hacking though.  I should know by tomorrow though :P
Sure thing!
Oh cool! Just to confirm ... OH just got your text :P. Smart thinking
Do I just have to show up early and then do a headcount?. And maybe give the driver directions?
Oh, and keep in contact with the VT coordinators on our status
Okay cool! Sounds good!
No problem!  Will you be forwarding the roster to me?
Okay! I'll record names in some fashion also!. /contact info
^-^ !
Great, thanks!. And no problem1. !*. Didn't get as far in homework as I liked, so I'm not doing a major hack--just something small I think!   Maybe a chrome app  
Sure I won't be limiting you if you want to do something bigger? I'll be working on Cloud and Text Mining a good amount of the time. Not sure, but I bet there will be plenty of people who don't have teams yet
Oh man, that's late! There were yummy sandwiches and cookies, and not that many sponsors/prizes, but Microsoft + Google are here.. I'm gonna spend some time at my house tonight to finish my financial aid app with my Mom.
Good luck to you too!! Do you need a ride from a bus station,  or are you getting dropped off at Squires?
Yeah, that's right near the Hackathon location which is in Torgersen! You'll just have to cross the street and enter the building under the bridge . Hackathon location
No problem!
Whoops, just left :P There were some Uva people in 1020. That's where I was
No :O But Niti was there at one point and you could message Christine or James (2nd yrs) to see where they are!! 
Haha, okay I hope it works out!!
Here is the updated bus list! (one person didn't show up, and one person who wasn't registered came). https://docs.google.com/a/virginia.edu/spreadsheets/d/1-U5cgdfRIaMcwgO2Y0rJSqwMuzcKVbwOmbvk7KZvrUc/edit?usp=sharing
No problem!!
Thanks :D I'm looking forward to it!! How do you like it so far?
Oh yeah, I hear Virginia has a way of pulling people back! I'm working at Capital One.
Yes, that would be awesome! !
However did you decide where to live?. Nah, no housing from C1
But how..?. I've been looking at Reddit discussions :P
Haha, I was thinking of finding a year long airbnb :P
Probably not cool with state laws though
Haven't heard of padmapper and the other, so I will check that out!. I'll definitely want to bring my guitar and skateboard!! But probably not furniture
Ahh, you board too ?? Is that as awesome as I'm thinking in SF?. Most likely in mid to late july!
Oh goodness. Yeah, I'm definitely on the beginner side of things then!. It's coming up quickly! :O
Whoa, is that common too, or just something you were interested in? I like ice skating a lot, so rollerblading sounds great
Whoa, that's awesome!! You totally should
Ah, I bet :P 70 degrees always?Haha!!! :PWhoa, cool! Thanks! . It's really detailed and helpful looking- thanks again! :D . Here it is: 6006 4926 1358 7953 783  PIN: 3922 :D
That's good news, except for the credit card. :P And I can't think of anything at the moment, but I'll let you know! I guess I should start getting things together for college soon! That list you made is a pretty nice present already! :D
:P The first one is so terrible!  I like the angel though! :D I think Twe has these for her phone too! My favorite is the one with it's tongue sticking out and the eyes on the side!
Yeah, that is weird. Hmm, is there another on with it's tongue out? Chris Herren came to our school to talk today! 
Yeah, that's the one! Whoa, you know about him? He talked about substance abuse and he was really engaging, and I think he was the best speaker we've ever had. The whole gym was silent and listening to him. It was pretty impressive. 
Haha, it's okay, I'd never heard of him either.  Johnathan Sprinkles? :P And nah, I'm not too sure yet. I'm going to be helping in the yard though, so maybe that counts for something! What about you--any ideas? I'm going to get to sleep now, so I might not respond till tomorrow; Also, good luck with all the end of year school stuff going on, exams/term projects or anything! G'night!. Do this and get $1.00 amazon credit! http://bit.ly/1EOLRe7. (Not spam). :P
Also, no class is pretty cool!! ^-^ :P. http://www.amazon.com/Genuine-Honda-Accessories-08P13-T2A-110-Season/dp/B00C8A2WZG
Oh good, I'll ship that one to your apartment! You're welcome!. I can take the metro from the airport to ballston! What is your station name, again?
Here are the flight details:. Also, I don't know about Dad's tax info--sorry!. :D Have an amazing time in Europe!!!!. P.S. If you get time, would you mind sending me the PITT passcode?
Oh neat, thank you so much! :D I hope you have a great day of Munich adventures. Hi! Want to meet for dinner today or sometime this week (not Tuesday)?. Whoops, meant to text this to you.. I'll forward it to sms. I hope your surgery has gone okay!!!!
Oh, that is so cool!!!! No more contacts :D How is the recovery? Not as scary as Mom's?
Yay, I'm glad it was a success!. The first week of classes went really well! All my classes are set in my schedule, and I'm close to figuring out some logistics like testing out of Linear Algebra and getting my Masters! I've also been looking at programs to apply to for J-Term, and I guess I need to apply for jobs soon :P .  How are you doing? Med school applications still in progress?. I've also been using the helmet, bearings, and capo you gave me a lot, so thank you for those!. The annual start-of-the-year Questbridge dinner went well too!
I'm most likely going to do the Belize program because it involves doing ecological field work in rainforest and ocean environments.  I am slightly concerned about Zika virus though. Do you have any friends who traveled to South America recently and survived without getting Zika?  I'm be happy for you too when you are all done with applications! Good job working through all of those. (:
Definitely!. Do you normally have Amazon giftwrap it?
Oh wow, thank you!. Also let me know how much the postage/wrapping paper is. I can pay extra since you'll be spending time shipping it off!
Okay. Looking forward to seeing you soon!
I got all As in my classes! I took the linear final and didn't pass, but I have Morris next semester, so that will be cool!
Mom thinks you want these. :O Do you?
Okay Thanks!
Hi Adriana! Yup, I'll be free by 6:30pm after my 5pm class (And also a small 1 hour block 4-5pm). Did you find a place to stay in CVille?
Oh yeah, is that at Sara's AirBnb?
Yes, that works for me!! Any new restaurants you wanted to try? I am always up for Poke again or Hibachi Grill Supreme or somewhere else!. Yeah, I hosted Peter there once!
Her cat Ginger is very cool!
I liked it! The gym at the Clubhouse was nice
Awesome, looking forward to seeing you and the Poke! Good luck preparing for your interview and with your class this Saturday and work and all (wow, busy!).
(It's 18).  Thanks!
Best of luck on your interview tomorrow!. Looking forward to it (:. I get out of my class at 6:15 from Brown library!. (Clark)
Looks like class finished early! Would meeting earlier work better for you?
Okay! I'll head over too! Be there in 11ish minutes. Did you want any of my furniture in CVille? I am starting to sell off stuff like my minifridge.
I don't use the minifridge, so I was trying to get rid of things people might need to buy at the beginning of the semester
I also have a microwave, one plastic drawer set, two white 10" wide 3 shelf bookcases, a two drawer nightstand, a small white desk.  Hmm, I feel like you have most of these things though.. Also the air purifier, a heater, a small desk chair, and my white small bookcase and white decorative table.
Oh cool! Are you thinking of keeping all your current furniture?
Also there's my bed, but I was thinking you would want to keep your queen!
Oh wow, I didn't realize! Well it looks pretty big :D. I'll keep those things around for you to take a look at when you come in for my graduation (or next time you are in CVille) !. Did you finish all your homework this week?
Oooh, well I can send you pictures too!. Oh yeah, okay!. ?? :O. Not required?
Yay! Enjoy your Saturday freedom!
They are going really well! I get to program robots in two of my classes!. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2STTNYNF4lk
I'm still deciding! Any ideas?
Haha, maybe! But that would be more tedious than technical, I think.
Thanks :P I'll send you those furniture pictures sometime next week!
Oh that's so cool! I'll have to watch it!
Not currently, but I can go upstairs and put it on!. Ohhh okay
:P Yeah, writing incremental parts of my Thesis. Have a good time watching :D Are you rooting for Pats or Falcons?
Oh nice, hope they stay in the lead then!. It is due March 4th, but fortunately, we get graded for writing chunks of it each week so we don't fall behind.. Have you ever bought any stocks? I've been trying out the Robinhood app to buy stocks and it's been really good so far!
Haha Interesting reasoning! I've only been using it for about 2 weeks. It's really cool; Tesla went up 4% today and I just made $300!. How long does filing taxes take? (Just curious)
Yup, I have Tesla, Amazon, and Micron through the Robinhood app. Thanks! Mom actually decided to claim me as a dependent this year, but I will try and help her with it this weekend!
I guess so!
No, but I want to see how it is done!
Neat!! That's nice. Did you need my white Chem lab coat for classes?
Haha, yes that one. Okay, just checking :PSounds good!
